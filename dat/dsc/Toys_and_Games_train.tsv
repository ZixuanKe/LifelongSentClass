I like the item pricing . My granddaughter wanted to mark on it but I wanted it just for the letters .	1
Love the magnet easel ... great for moving to different areas ... Wish it had some sort of non skid pad on bottom though ...	1
Both sides are magnetic . A real plus when you 're entertaining more than one child . The four-year old can find the letters for the words , while the two-year old can find the pictures the words spell . ( I bought letters and magnetic pictures to go with this board ) . Both grandkids liked it a lot , which means I like it a lot as well . Have not even introduced markers , as this will be used strictly as a magnetic board .	1
Bought one a few years ago for my daughter and she loves it , still using it today . For the holidays we bought one for our niece and she loved it too .	1
I have a stainless steel refrigerator therefore there are not much space for my son to play with his magnet . Brought this for him to put his magnet on . He enjoys sticking his magnet on it . Great to have so he can play with his alphabet magnets .	1
My granddaughter really really likes this . I love that you can just fold it up and put it away . Would definately recommend .	1
This is good product to have with unlimited possibilities . I also ordered the magnetic letters & numbers by Melissa & Doug . The dry erase has to be erased quickly or they tend to leave marks . Also , the magnet is not very strong . It 's a nice size & works very well for our needs .	1
Very nice to use with magnet letters and practice spelling . Holds the letters great and folds together nicely for storage . You can use it on a table or even the floor .	1
Bought this board along with Melissa and Doug wood and magnetic letters and numbers kit . The size is great for my 2-year-old grandson to play with , and there are 2 sides to use . This is a big hit in my home and will grow with children as they become more creative ... great learning tool too . I also bought a container of magnetic foam objects so we can work with his spelling as he has now mastered his letters and numbers . I believe it is also compatible with dry-erase markers for older children . I highly recommend this board ... great size to travel with also .	1
sturdy and perfect for coffee table . magnets stick easily and it 's great for 2 sided products . plus , you can use dry erase on the board for when they get a bit older . good product	1
We had purchased Melissa & Doug magnets & had some made & went looking for a board . THIS IS IT ! It is so reasonable and has been in use ever since we received it . You can spell words , put the Leap Frog base on it to put in letters/animals , numbers , etc . It is also double sided . Even though it 's not intended they also like to put things under/inside the board . They can roll things through it . Highly recommend & every child should have one to put their magnets on .	1
We purchased this to go with the magnetic letters and animals sets we just got . I really love this easel . It 's sturdy and large . We 've used it many times without any issue whatsoever . I also love that it also functions as a wipeboard . A+	1
This easel is the perfect size for my three year old grandson -- he can use it on the floor or the tabletop , and loves to play with his letters and numbers .	1
This is my absolute favorite design book . The patterns are so intricate and fun to color . I can only imagine the possibilities !	1
Working with Mandala type coloring books can teach us a lot . 1 ) the light/dark placement of colors to bring into focus the center of the mandala ( an example is on the cover of the book ) . 2 ) learning color choices that work together , teaching us the basics of the standard color wheel . 3 ) to stay concentrated to a task is good for improving or retaining cognitive capacities . 4 ) becomes a relaxing process , 5 ) last and certainly not least , to have some good fun . All of these points will improve our sense of well being.I like this particular Mandala coloring book by Marty Noble because it is a bit more complicated that her other mandala coloring books . These are very traditional type designs that exhibit ancient sacred designs that span across several spiritual traditions . They are easily removed from the book to work one at a time . Four Star : The designs are on each page , front and back . This means you can not use alcohol markers or markers that will bleed through the paper and ruin the other side . Use high quality coloring pencils for best results.Creative Suggestion : Is to put your favorite design on an overhead projector , shine it on a chosen spot on a blank canvas and trace it . Then fill in with acrylics or oils or even water colors . Or you could complete this same process and project on a wall . This is sure to make an inspirational , yet soothing statement to your surroundings .	1
This book contains 30 full page designs that are beautiful and intricate in nature . Most of the designs are 7 x 9 1/2 inches . Great resource for any artist !	1
Prepare to be swept away by the beauty of the images that your color choices will create . The spaces to color are sometimes very small , and require careful work and a steady hand . However , the payoff is immense . These images are beautifully done , and the work you do on them will inspire you.You may want to photocopy the pages if you wish to display or use each one , since they are printed back-to-back.Just beautifully done !	1
Oh , and for my teenager too . Because that 's who I really ordered it for . Honest . But , I am going to borrow it . I call it sharing.I ordered several of these - different designs - but all by Dover and Marty Noble . Of all of them , this is my favorite DESIGN - but least favorite layout . It does n't take up the entire page like the rest of the books do . The design is in the center , and there is quite a bit of white , blank page , left all around it on every side . What you see on the cover , is probably the biggest design in all of the book . I will try to get a picture of the inside in the next few days , and post it here for you to see.Despite that , I do love the design . ( Just wish it were bigger , taking up more of the page . ) I love coloring . It does n't matter to me what it is , I just like to color . I love that I have small children still ( 9 and 2 ) that I can color with , without looking completely silly ( Not that I 'd really care ) . Coloring is relaxing.I stumbled across this book when I was looking for art supplies , and coloring books for my 17-year-old . ( I typed in 'coloring book for teens ' on a whim ) . And I was happy to find these designs by Marty Noble . The price was reasonable , and the quality is nice . It 's not a thick ( lots of pages ) coloring book like you would find for small children , only around 40 pages , I think . But the pages are n't thin like a child 's coloring book either . They are a little thicker . A little better quality . Nice bold white sheets . I 'm thinking you may be able to use markers on this without them bleeding through , but I do n't know for sure yet . I 'm going to try it.I 'm pleased with my purchase , and will definitely be ordering more .	1
Very nice for time destraction . Bought for my 14 year old niece . Although she would rather have a controller or keyboard in her hand , I at times I give her this for a & # 34 ; technology break & # 34 ; !	1
I can color right along with my grandchildren , without feeling intellectually compromised at the project . This book is so amazing that I have used some of the designs for stained glass windows . I highly recommend this for anyone who does not want to grow out of a favorite pasttime .	1
This coloring book has provided hours of creativity and entertainment . I color in this book while watching tv to give my hand something to do .	1
The art is nice in this coloring book . But I find some of the pages to be boring and repetitive . Thin pages mean you can not use markers , which is a bummer .	1
This book looks really fun and cool . Have n't opened or used it yet because I got it for my 6 year old daughter for xmas but i know she will enjoy doing the projects with me . she is very creative and loves crazy weird stuff so this seems right up her alley .	1
Kids who I treat love to read all the optical illusion books . This was great because it had the projects so they could understand it even more .	1
My son got this as a gift . We have had fun doing the activities in this book . I would even buy this to give away as gifts for other children .	1
This is a good sized book . Great quality . I bought it for my two year old so she would stop putting stickers in rab random places . I think it would be perfect for an older kid who is really into stickers .	1
We have n't found a sticker that wo n't peel off the pages . My daughter spent 2 hours Christmas morning going through this book . Great book !	1
This is a great sticker book , with large rings in the middle for easy page turning . The pages are each filled with colorful pictures that your child ( or you ) can fill with all kinds of stickers that they want to keep . The book is the right material to allow the stickers to be moved ( though they still lose their ability to be moved over time ) , and it even comes with a couple of stickers in the middle . These stickers are in a pouch at the back , which can be used in the future to store full sheets of stickers ( or stickers that have not yet made it into the book ) .	1
This item arrived quickly ! My 7 yr old opened it on Christmas Eve and smiled from ear to ear . It is the perfect gift for a sticker lover . She sat for hours decorating her pages with her sticker collection . Brought back so many memories for me too , being a child of the 80 's who collected stickers .	1
We thought this might be a nice place for my 2 year-old daughter to collect her reward stickers instead of on sticker charts that just get thrown in the trash . The quality of this book is fantastic . It has a very heavy , sturdy cover and thick pages that are coated to allow for removal and re-sticking.Each page has different , fun scenery , which makes it visually appealing even when there are n't a ton of stickers on that particular page . My daughter is so excited to earn stickers and put them in this book , and she even enjoys spending time just flipping through the pages and admiring her collection . I can foresee this lasting until she 's pretty much bored with collecting stickers , and that 's a couple years down the road .	1
All 3 of my kids love these books ! They carry them every where and they keep them entertained for hours ! Even my 3 1/2 year old will sit and move the stickers around , add more stickers and is happy as a clam ! The books are of amazing quality , stickers can be pulled off , moved around and stacked with not damage to the stickers . The stickers that you can order from the website are the best . You can not buy anything like them . My kids love the foods that you can stack and make hamburgers etc . Stickers have become the best incentive for my kids . They love to earn and trade for new stickers . These books make a great birthday gift , party favor and holiday present .	1
My son loves when we read any/all of the Llama Llama books , so when I saw this , I knew he 'd be thrilled . And thrilled he was ! It 's adorable !	1
Kids seem to love the sing-song prose of the Llama Llama books , and of course they all carry a little moral type message for kids without being too obvious .	1
If your child likes the llama llama books , then you HAVE TO BUY this plush llama llama doll ! It is absolutely adorable . My daughter loves hers !	1
This came today and my son instantly recognized it from the book . He is two so I 'm a bit worried about the little bear attached , as in what if he rips it off in the middle of the night and chokes on it kind of fear . So for now , we will watch him , but otherwise seems great .	1
I bought this for my granddaughter along with the books Lama Lama Red Pajamas and Lama Lama Mad at Mama , and found the stuffed animal to be the perfect size and match for a toddler to snuggle with and carry around.It 's very well made ( he 's a little skinny ) but do n't regret the purchase . Our 2-year-old granddaughter loved him ( as well as the books ) .	1
I have to praise amazon for having this product at a great price . We actually picked one up at Barnes and Noble and I could n't bring myself to pay $ 20+ dollars for a simple stuffed animal that feels painfully like a claw-machine reject . That said my five-year-old daughter has put her llama to bed every night since Christmas while reading it llama llama stories . I hope it holds up better than it feels like it should ...	1
Our class just loves the Llama Llama series . It is nice to have the actual llama stuffed doll . Good value for the price .	1
We have so much fun with Llama Llama ... we read the books with the plush and change the clothes , pretend to brush teeth ... etc . There are great messages in the books and easy to read/follow for the kiddos .	1
I LOVE the illustrations on these flashcards . That is what prompted me to buy them for my daughter 's second birthday . The cards are very sturdy and have a nice weight and finish to them . My one issue is trying to keep them together . The ring that holds the card together is kind of flimsy . There is value in having the cards be detachable but I almost wish the ring was more permanent . It can be frustrating when you are missing cards . Overall , these are the most attractive , charming ABC flashcards I have ever found . I think I may have been a little too eager though because my daughter is only 2 and she does n't seem that interested yet . But if you want some nice sturdy flashcards with charming , frameworthy illustrations I would buy these .	1
I am so delighted with these flashcards . I actually ordered the 'My first words ' version of these and liked them so much I went back and ordered these . I had not heard of the mudpuppy brand before , but I 'm looking into see what other products they make . My son is 16 months old , so these are a great toy to help him start to point out animals and make noises , as well as to learn his ABCs . ( The only watch out is that some of the animals I could not think what noises they make ! ) It is fun for us to go through the ring together or they are easy enough for him to manipulate that he can entertain himself by using them on his own . Given his age , a lot of things still end up in his mouth , including these cards . They have held up very well and are n't completely destroyed ! The designs are very cute and this is something that I can see us getting a lot of use out of for the next year or two . I liked them so much , I ordered another ring for an upcoming trip -- -they seem like a great plane ride activity.Also , I would highly recommend getting theSecure-A-Toy , BLACK-WHITEto go with this . I used this to strap the rings to the carseat and the stroller , so he can thumb through the cards on his own , but not lose them if he decides to throw them . If you have not used these in general , I highly suggest , as I 've found a ton of uses over the last few weeks ... they 're especially great when traveling .	1
These flash cards are perfect for our 2 year-old . We could have even started much sooner and wish we would have . He loves these cards , remembers the animals and is even learning how to recognize letters ! Others have said the ring comes apart but honestly , if that happens I will replace the plastic ring with a cheap metal one and keep going , no big deal !	1
My 16 month old son loves this set of flash cards . Because they are on the ring , I can hand them to him in the car and he flips through them looking at the pictures and telling us what he thinks each animal is . Some of the pictures are a little folk arty for easy identification but my son loves them !	1
the cards is colorful and the designed of the letters is so fabulousi like the fact of the cards it ca n't rippedi 'm going to buy animals flash card	1
We got this to our 2yo . It is a lot of fun and he gets really into putting his robots together !	1
If you have a kid that likes robots - and want some car toys - get this ! It keeps my sons attention in the car and the pieces do n't go flying because they are magnets . Cute graphics too .	1
After reading the reviews of others , I still purchased this toy as well as the one to make silly faces of the same make - I also purchased a couple of small magnetic boards ( after reading that the actual sheets to put the magnets on are not magnetic ) and clip the sheets onto the magnetic board before having my grandson put the magnetic pieces in place - this works out quite well ! But , yes , I agree the sheets should be magnetic that 's why I did not give this toy 5 stars ! These toys are great for stimulating imaginative play as well as learning face/body parts !	1
My 3 year old son is obsessed with robots ! So when you can build robots with magnets , WONDERFUL ! He does n't really use the `` backdrops '' that come with the little set , he uses the magnets on our fridge or dishwasher , which is just fine by me ! He does , however , keep all the magnets in the metal tin they came in ! I think it 's because there 's a cool robot on the front . = ) The robot pieces are so unique ! Not your plain old everyday robots , oh no ! You can use radios , lamps , even mechanical cats to build your robots ! So fun !	1
My grandson really likes robots and liked this toy . He plays with it frequently and it is durable . Would recommend it highly .	1
I bought this as a secret santa gift that I divided up and give the child a couple pieces a day till christmas . They loved it !	1
The size of this puzzle is perfect for my 3 yr old . Also the I love how sturdy and durable the pieces are . Would recommend this company for puzzles for kids .	1
This is a great floor puzzle and our children enjoy it very much . It promotes eye hand coordination , visual perception , problem solving and many other skills .	1
Very nice puzzle . I love the big pieces , and the durable cardboard . My 3 yo really likes it . Mudpuppy puzzles are good quality and the designs are cute .	1
When we first got it , I was disappointed as I thought it would be too complicated for our toddler . Instead he 's mastered it ! He notices all these little things in the picture , like the umbrella and the pink dog , which gives him clues about putting it together . These jumbo puzzles are great !	1
This looks like it will be a fun puzzle for my grandson . Nice size pieces , should be fun to make on the kitchen floor .	1
This puzzle was a great birthday present for the birthday boy who loves puzzles . He found the subject matter a lot of fun . After all , what boy does n't love trucks and such ? Packaging was good as alway from Amazon and arrival time was as usual there when estimated .	1
These are very cute but small . I ordered them for my daughter but will have to wait to use them until she is a little older .	1
This is a very nice magnet set and the milk-carton box it comes in is adorable . The quality of the printing on the animals ( which are very cute - just not ) just is n't as crisp the photos online suggest -- which detracts slightly from the overall great quality and cute artistry . I wish the colors were a little brighter , but I guess the softness gives the animals a gentleness that they might not otherwise have . I love how there are different versions of the animals . As another reviewer said , many have a mom , dad , and baby to match up with . My 2.5 year old likes it when I pick out a baby and make him `` talk '' and say `` where is my mommy/ ( daddy ) ? '' and then she searches for the mom ( or dad ) . She likes to make the animals `` ride '' on the tractor and feed them the apples or hay . When we put them away , I pretend like the top of the box is a hungry mouth and she loves throwing the magnets into the mouth ( kinda goofy , but at least it gets her to help a little ... I guess ) . They seem to stick pretty well and I have n't had any peeling issues . If it ever goes for ten bucks , I would grab it . We paid sixteen , and I guess it 's worth it for the box and quantity and I think these guys are so much cuter than the Melissa & Doug animals , but still ... a few bucks less would have been nice ! : ) We also have their sweets & treats magnet set and my daughter loves that .	1
Once my baby was old enough to stand , she wanted our fridge magnets . I wanted to get her something fun , but also kind of stylish that I could stand seeing all over my fridge . She loves these - it taught her all of her animals !	1
I bought these for my one year old grandaughter along with the traditional set of letter magnets . She enjoys them but has some trouble with them because they are on the small and thin side . ( better as she gets older ) Great for learning animals , good colors , cute drawings .	1
My son is almost two and has had these on his magnet board in his playroom for a few months now . He likes the farmer and the tractor magnets the best and we use the animals to work with animal sounds often . These are small ( which I know , it 's in the description ) . The artwork is pretty cute and the magnet part does it 's job . They come in really cute packaging ... my friend used them in her little one 's Easter basket , which was great visual display . But really for $ 18 they are more of an item I 'd expect to find in an overpriced Boutique . Once they get out of the cute carton packaging they are just your ordinary $ 1 bin magnets .	1
I appreciate the materials used to create this puzzle and our three year-old loves the picture that is formed when the puzzle is complete . Soy inks + recycled cardboard = Wonderful.I have only one criticism , and it 's a minor one . Since the puzzle is intended for a younger audience , it might be nice if the pieces were a bit thicker . Our son has good fine motor skills , but the pieces can still bend and crease as he works to fit them together . With that said however , the creasing may be due more to his impatience when the pieces do n't seem to fit right than with the build quality of the puzzle .	1
I love the larger size pieces ( these are about the size of my HAND ) for little fingers and older hands . My granddaughter was excited when I received this and immediately read the top `` At the Zoo . '' Yes , she is old enough to assemble it for herself.For those who have younger kids ( age 2 or so ) who enjoy putting puzzles together , one of the ways to handle this is to give them two pieces at a time and have them figure out which way to put them . It gives beginning skills , AND gives a chance for social interaction.I have worked with the elderly at nursing homes and am always looking for puzzles for aging arthritic hands as well . This is bright and cheerful enough to use there , especially when we assemble it with grandkids ! The pieces are sturdy ( seem just a bit thicker than standard puzzle pieces ) but are n't for kids who still chew . They wo n't choke on these , but they could `` mush '' them up a bit.Bright , cheerful , fun , and best of all , huge pieces.I have removed a star because the size of the cuts themselves ( holes and tabs ) seem very much alike and do n't give visual clues . A child who is not looking at the pattern could easily smash them together and insist that they fit .	1
A very cute puzzle . Nice that it comes in a top-loading box that 's big enough to put pieces in edge-wise . Box is big enough that even smaller kids can put it away after putting it together.Puzzle has very large pieces that are easy for little hands to grasp.It 's still the same fiberboard stuff that most puzzles are made of , which can be easily damaged , which would be my only complaint for small children ( wood is far more sturdy , so I knocked off a star for that . ) Still a very cute puzzle for the little ones they 'll want to do over & over . Edges get worn a little bit on the corners , but other than that , it 's beautiful & easy to put away . Box even has a handle so they can put it away all by themselves .	1
We 've picked up Melissa and Doug , Ravensburger , and now Mudpuppy floor puzzles for our daughter . I like all of them , and they each have good points and not so good points , but the wonderful thing about the Mudpuppy puzzle is it 's in a box with a handle , so that she can carry it around . We love involved activities that travel well , and this is a good choice for a puzzle-crazy toddler . The picture is bright and has clearly-drawn animals that she enjoys , and the pieces fit well together , but not as well as the Ravensburger or even the Melissa and Doug . The carrying-case cancels that out , in my opinion , because it 's a great grab-and-go item for a trip .	1
My daughter is an official puzzle connoisseur . We have a shelf devoted just to puzzles . Floor puzzles are her current favorite , and she loved this one . The pieces are big and easy to maneuver , the colors are bright and cheery , and the zoo scene is very cute . She loves the elephant spraying water and always puts that section together first . For kid appeal , it gets an A plus.From a mom 's perspective , I love the box . It 's sturdy and has held up well to dumping the pieces out and putting them back . I like the carrying strap too - nice touch . The puzzle pieces themselves are made of a thick cardboard . While my daughter has outgrown this stage , it does say the pieces are made with nontoxic paints so it 's okay if your child happens to gnaw on them while assembling the puzzle . My only complaint is with snapping the pieces together - they do n't seem to hold together as well as our Melissa and Doug puzzles . For an adult it 's really not a big deal , but it can sometimes be frustrating for my daughter when the pieces keep snapping back apart on their own.Overall , it 's a cute puzzle . I 'm not sure how long it will hold up given that the pieces do n't have a firm lock , but it 's still a nice addition to our puzzle collection .	1
We are a puzzle-loving family ! I believe there is nothing quite like puzzle-building to enhance your family time especially during weekends or holidays ... This adorable , large piece , durable puzzle will get the young members of your family excited and ready to join in the fun ! Little kids will not have a difficult time building this puzzle as the pieces fit so well , and the illustrations are vivid and make finishing the puzzle an easy job ! I have added an image to the product page .	1
This is a nice size and is made very well . The pieces are very sturdy . Once your child uses perceptual , and fine-motor skills to put the puzzles together you can use the puzzle to learn about various animal such the koala , ploar bear , lion . The sturdiness of the product means it will be long-lasting . The box has a neat rope handle for little ones to use when taking their special puzzle from room to room or from house to house . Puzzles are becoming a fogotten activity/skill but I am glad that this one was a big hit . I recommend it for children 3-8 .	1
The Mudpuppy At the Zoo Jumbo Floor puzzle was my 2.5 year old grandson 's first jigsaw puzzle . He loved it and we have had great fun with it . Before we even opened the box , he enjoyed the picture of the puzzle and naming all the animals at the zoo . When we dumped out the pieces on the playroom floor , he got very excited . I tried to get him to do the border first but he is still a little young so I helped him to put it together . Then with the inside pieces left , we talked about what each piece looked like from the picture and found a place for it . After the first few tries of fitting pieces in correctly , he got the hang of it and did it on his own . We did it a couple of more times and he did n't seem to tire of it . He liked leaving it together when he went to take a nap . I think it is a wonderful , educational toy and fun one for first timers like he is . I think 2-3 is about the right age to start it and children a little older should be able to easily do it on their own . Sturdy , bright and well made !	1
First puzzle I 've seen that is a nice transition for the clunky baby wooden puzzles to the grown up toddler durable kids toys . What little one does n't want to be just like the big kids . Well this puzzle is challenging yet simple enough for little ones to do , and also has the durability that allows to be a childhood favorite to do over and over again . Comes with a nice carrying box that helps keep our household from loosing the pieces .	1
This is a nice , jumbo puzzle ! It has a glossy finish , so each piece can easily be wiped off . My little ones like the big pieces and it 's perfect for `` table time '' fun . It 's very durable . The picture is cute and bright . It even comes with a cute box that has a string attached for holding and toting around . I 'm very pleased with it !	1
When I read the description , I visualized a HUGE puzzle with GIGANTIC puzzle pieces . These are n't . They are a little bigger than most , but not much . It comes in a cute little box with a rope handle to make it easy to carry around . I love the pictures and the colors . Getting a small child to sit still long enough to put it together is another thing entirely . Good luck with that !	1
This is a perfect puzzle for my 2.5 and 4.5 year old daughters . Puzzles with a few animals are much easier to work with than the ones with one big animal . That , coupled with the colorful images are enough to keep them fully engaged . My 2 year old can work on it by herself , but at some point she needs help in completing it . We are moving soon , and this is definitely one of the puzzles we will keep . Others , we will give away.My wife and I are very satisfied with this product and recommend it .	1
This floor puzzle is a nice size - not huge , but larger than normal kid puzzles . The pieces are thick and lock together well , even on carpet . It seemed to be medium difficulty in that the connectors and pieces are all shaped very similarly . Without too much forcing , you can get a piece to lock into the wrong spot . It will have a gap , but since the pieces are so similarly shaped , it makes this possible . That 's the only downside I could find.The pieces are cardboard , but are very dense , almost like wood , but not quite that solid . They do n't have too much curl from the cutting process , so it all lays nice and flat . My son put it together on berber carpet without having any issues with pieces not staying together.The storage box is ok- kind of thin cardboard .	1
My daughter is still at the age where everything goes into her mouth , so let me start by saying that while the cardboard pieces are sturdy and well made , they are not drool proof . The puzzle consists of five rows and five columns , making for 25 easy to assemble pieces . The colors are vibrant and the picture is as cute in person as you would expect from the box . We ( I ) put the puzzle together on the carpet , and the pieces locked fine . I would expect that once Fiona gets old enough to do it herself , it will be much easier for her to assemble on a hard surface.My one criticism is very superficial . The box is about twice as big as it needs to be . You may be wondering why that matters ... . It is amazing how much stuff a tiny little baby accumulates . And as the tiny little baby grows , the aount of stuff grows as well . Exponentially . When the box , granted the very nice box , is twice as large as it needs to be , it means it takes up twice as much room as necessary as well .	1
This is a great puzzle for young children . The pieces are thick and large and that makes it easy for little hands to handle . ( the pieces are roughly 4.5 x 5.5 inches to 4.5 x7 inches ) The pieces lock into place easily . The sturdiness of the pieces will help this puzzle last through many assemblies and disassemblies . The colors are crisp and bright and there is a nice variety of colors to help young children find the right pieces.While this may seem unimportant , I like that ( unlike most puzzles ) the box opens at the top and it also has a nice rope carry handle.And , finally , the picture is really cute .	1
I have reviewed Ravensburger puzzles in the past and this puzzle seem even more high quality.My nephew loves these at the time of this writing he 's only 2 1/2 years old but he still combating these puzzles out and I think this is great for his abilities to problem solve in the future . So it says 3+ on the box but my nephews of building them since he was just over two.The pieces are high-quality made from sturdy cardboard and there 's deftly no choking hazard as they are really extra large pieces . And the prices really decent nice puzzle for 15 bucks ( at the time of writing this review ) . Another thing I like about this is the back of the puzzle is a white surface so after they 've done this puzzle for a while and maybe are getting bored with it you can put together white side up and then draw together on it and then let the child put that puzzle that they made together just an idea but deftly could be fun for the whole family . You could even draw a map to their birthday or Christmas presents on the puzzle pieces that have them find the puzzle pieces to build the map find where their presence are located ( that which is me brainstorming out but that would be fun also ) Here 's a few things that you can do to introduce the puzzle and get more out of it . I think putting it together 1st so the child gets the picture and then start disassembling it a piece of the time will help engage even young children and helping them to get the concepts of puzzles . another thing you could do is put the puzzle together upside down have them flip each piece over and then start putting each piece they flip over together again another little way to help them get engaged and understand the concepts of puzzles.To me I personally feel that helping children understand puzzles and how to put pieces together is one of the best early learning tools you can offer them .	1
This is a sturdy and easy to put together puzzle . 24pcs . Cardboard . Really cute illustrations . I love the big pieces and think the best educational value is for the dexterity a young child can learn putting puzzles pieces together . My kids found this an easy puzzle , just because of the big pieces . My 2 yr old nephew found it a bit more challenging , but with help enjoyed the outcome . The box can easily double as a storage box for the pieces and it has a carrying handle for little hands . My 7-10yr olds liked putting it together and did so a couple of times before they got bored . My 2 yr old nephew enjoys putting this together over and over again ( probably because of not only the challenge , but the time spent with older folks who `` help '' him ) : )	1
This puzzle is very attractive for kids , at least for those with whom I 've used it . It features a number of different animals , all presented in a very cute manner . The colors are quite bright , and the puzzle makes little ones think without being so challenging as to push them away from using it.My only issue lies with the quality of the puzzle pieces , which do n't lock together as securely as I would have expected given the price . I do like the sturdy box , and the drawstring makes it easy to carry around . As someone who has seen many puzzle boxes fall apart over the years leading to a mess of different puzzles stored in the wrong boxes , this is much appreciated.I would recommend this for any parent of a young child , there are n't many kids who would n't enjoy this one .	1
My little girl ( almost 3 ) is really into animals right now and had a lot of fun doing this puzzle with me . She 's still too young to really grasp how to put the pieces together , but we named the animals as we put them together and she tried to put pieces together . It is a nice size ; big but not too big to have to crawl over it to reach where the pieces have to go .	1
Mudpuppy at the Zoo is a brightly colored attractive puzzle to engage young minds . Puzzles are great for motor skills and problem solving , especially for young minds.My 2 1/2 year old niece loves puzzles , so Mudpuppy at the Zoo was an instant hit . She is drawn to the cute animals and bright colors . She still has trouble picking out how the picture goes together , but the shape of the puzzle pieces helps her to solve it . She needs some help with the puzzle , so a 2 year age recommendation may not work in all cases . But she learns teamwork and problem-solving skills.The pieces are a little thicker than traditional pieces , easier for smaller hands to grip and piece together . Although it is still cardboard , the extra thickness makes it more durable . The construction of the pieces is great and should last repeated puzzling , even with a toddler . I would caution putting the puzzle together on softer surfaces like carpet or padded tables , the pieces are more likely to bend faster . I especially like that it is made from recycled paper and nontoxic soy-based inks.I recommend this puzzle and this company to toddlers , or those who would supply them with puzzles . Highly enjoyable !	1
Jumbo puzzles are the way to go for young ones . This one is n't too difficult for a little child to figure out and is big enough that there wo n't be any fear of them choking on any pieces . The puzzles are made very sturdy and will handle some abuse.My 3 year old niece enjoyed it and I 'm sure yours will too .	1
My three-year-old is a puzzling fiend , so I 'm always looking for fun puzzles to get her . She loves animals , so this was a natural choice . The picture is cute and the pieces seem to be high enough quality to last for a while . That 's all I was looking for .	1
This is a really cute puzzle for both girls and boys it is a beginner puzzle and it has pretty large pieces so it 's easy for children as young as 2 . It comes in a nice box for easy storage .	1
The pieces to this puzzle are large and probably strong enough to be used a number of times , without being damaged by small hands . The glossy picture was unusual at first but children like bright shiny things.Each piece seems to have a fairly distinctive part of the picture - like the trunk of an elephant or a penguin or polar bear -- which makes it very easy for the younger group , the 2 or 3 year olds , to put it together without struggling . Any older and it is too easy . Younger and it becomes more difficult to maneuver the pieces together ; plus the drool will probably wreck the pieces.I 'm on the fence about this puzzle . The children were n't really interested in it when I left the box on the table . And yet , they all crowded around when they saw theDragon Nursery 24 Piece Floor Puzzle , even though it was too young for them . They liked the big bold colors better .	1
This is a nice puzzle . 25 LARGE pieces - about 4 inches across ! The colors are bright and it 's easy to put together . I love the rope handle on the box that makes it easy to carry too . It 's always a plus to have a product that is primarily made out of recycled materials .	1
The nephews fully enjoyed this item when they come over . The pieces are big so no one can choke . Also , the pieces are think and have good weight to them . Very durable and will last many years . Even the new generation in a few years .	1
My two year old was excited to try and piece this one together ( with lots of help ) . The pieces are large and quite sturdy . This is good because the puzzle size is large and the little ones are bound to walk on the pieces.The puzzle design is interesting and provides lots of visual cues on where the pieces go . This is great for kids who are learning how to figure out puzzles.It comes in a cute box with a carrying handle.Would make an excellent gift too .	1
I love teaching children how to do puzzles . It is such a great learning tool . The task of sorting by shape and color is a very important skill to learn and also maintain . This is a really fun puzzle-quality made and the colors are vibrant . Please do puzzles with your children , it is a lifelong hobby and a nice way to unplug from this overly technological world we live in .	1
Kids really prefer the puzzles with the large pieces . These puzzles have nice large pieces with images that are nice flat 2 dimensional drawings that they can easily line up . The pieces fit nicely together . They are not too tight or too loose . There also did n't seem to be any false positives , which is nice because that seems to frustrate the kids sometimes . The pieces felt thick and sturdy . The glossy images also felt nicely adhered . The rope handle on the box is nice , but the best part about the box is that it 's over-sized for the pieces , and it folds open at the top . This makes it easier for the kids to put the puzzle away , since there is plenty of room and the box does n't have too parts.Pro : Fun easy to follow imagesPro : Quality piecesPro : Pieces fit together wellPro : Nice box	1
My 3 year old grandaughter absolutely loves puzzles and is quite good at putting them together . When I gave her this Jumbo Puzzle to work on she quickly put it together as well . The one thing that frustrated her was we put it together on the carpet and it was n't flat enough . I think she did n't think she was doing it correctly when it did n't seem to snap together easily . I would recommend putting this together on a smooth surface , large table , wood floor . Other than that one frustration , my grandaughter loved it . It has a little handle on the box , so the puzzle pieces can be neatly stored away and the child can carry the box .	1
Puzzles are new to us . We have n't done much as a family , so I decided to give this a shot . We 've been working a lot on patterns and shapes , so I figured that a puzzle might be in order . I remember playing with puzzles when I was little , but forgot that it takes a bit of an attention span . My daughter is just not there yet . We have yet to put the whole thing together . 24 pieces is just too much for her . We 've gotten a little more than halfway and then something distracts her . I do like being able to teach how things fit together . I 'm hoping that when she is just a little bit older , she will be able to sit still long enough to get the rest of the puzzle together ( she 's just barely 2 ) .One thing that I really like is the box . It is sturdy and easy to open and close . I remember puzzle boxes being really flimsy , so this was an excellent surprise . It 's also nice to know that if she sticks the puzzle piece in her mouth ( which is n't happening nearly as much as it used to ) , it 's not going to harm her . I 'm glad they advertise the soy paint products . I guess that is why it is more expensive than most of the other puzzles I have seen.Overall , I think this is a good product , but probably closer to the top of the age group instead of 24 months .	1
We love this floor puzzle . My toddler loves the animals and has fun naming them all as we put it together . At 27 months he ca n't quite do it by his self , but enjoys it with Mommy 's help and is starting to be able to get some of the pieces together . He also loves the box ( do n't they all ? ) and likes the string handle that he can carry it with.The pieces are large and just right for toddler hands . It is fairly sturdy . We have n't had any trouble with bent pieces , but the picture is being to peel on a few of them.Overall , this is a very nice floor puzzle for toddlers/preschoolers .	1
Puzzles are fun for the whole family in my house . My toddler loves them and while we are spreading out the pieces and working on the puzzle sometimes my infant loves to grab at a few colorful pieces and point out an animal or chomp a piece . I do try to deter him from chomping but I feel better knowing that this Mudpuppy puzzle is made from non toxic paints . The zoo theme is great fun for a toddler , many animals to look at and discuss while we are putting it together . The colors are pleasing as well compared to the uber-brightness of most children 's toys . The quality is not as high as other puzzles I have bought ( Ravensburger ) but still decent quality and I 'd like to think it is because of Mudpuppy 's choice to use 90 percent recycled materials and soy-based inks . We are extra careful .	1
I take my duties as an Amazon reviewer seriously , and I try to give my readers the best possible information they can get before they make a purchase . With that in mind , I try to judge products on their own merits , rating them highly if they are good and poorly if they are bad . However , if the product is not as a good as a common competitor , I just ca n't give it a full five stars . This is where I find myself in judging this Mudpuppy puzzle.My kids love puzzles . Our house is filled with all sorts of puzzles from 25 pieces to 2500 pieces . We just completedDragon Nursery 24 Piece Floor Puzzleand had a blast with it . In fact , it was sitting on the floor as we opened the Mudpuppy Puzzle . Perhaps this was unfair , but it is a fact of the puzzle market.To start with , the Mudpuppy puzzle is a quality toy . The pieces are thick and sturdy , with a glossy front and back that will make them resistant to drool and occasional food that may get on them . They fit together nicely and have bright , vibrant colors . The box has a nice carry handle made of rope , and the pieces fit in the box easily . We have a Melissa and Doug puzzle the kids like , but it is hard to get the pieces put back so that the box closes . That 's not a problem here - the box is plenty big for the pieces to be put back by a kid . The picture is nice - my 2 year old liked it , but my 5 year old thought it a little plain . He preferred his Ravensburger and Melissa and Doug puzzle artwork far more.And there 's the problem -- Mudpuppy puzzle quality is similar to M & D ; , but far below that of Ravensburger . The Ravensburger pieces are just such high quality , it is hard to compete . Plus , the Ravensburger puzzles cost less ! So my review ? It 's a great puzzle , quite possibly 5 stars . But with Ravensburger building better puzzles for less money , I have to knock it back to 4 , although my kids sure liked that rope handle on the box .	1
Our 3 year old loves animals and fell in love with this puzzle at first sight . After a little coaching from us , she is now able to work on putting it together all by herself.We enjoy doing puzzles at our house . They are a great educational tool and can be a nice quiet time activity . I often get this out to keep her occupied while I 'm cooking dinner . It has been fun to talk about all the animal names and remember our own trips to the zoo.The packaging and pieces are both good quality . This puzzle contains 25 pieces and forms 22x22 square . The puzzle itself is very colorful . There are a lot of fun , interesting things to see in it . This would make a delightful gift for any young animal lover .	1
I had a lot of fun putting this puzzle together . I confess that I used the picture on the box once or twice . The pieces ( 25 ) are big , colorful , and well made , and the box states that the puzzle greyboard and the packaging contain recycled paper , and it 's printed with nontoxic , soy-based inks . ( I checked for that . ) However , I wanted to get another opinion -- one from the target group , so I offered it to a neighbor so her children could test it . Here 's her report : '' Della Kate ( 6 ) and Hardy ( 4 ) both enjoyed it very much . For Della Kate it was very easy and for Hardy it was a bit more challenging but he could still complete it independently in a matter of minutes . Both returned several times to the puzzle without my suggestion . `` Sounds like a great gift for a kid , and it 's educational with all the zoo animals . You can teach them about seals , koalas , pandas , and the rest of the animals and birds and visitors . The koala mother and baby are really cute , btw.Note : Designed in the U.S.A. , but manufactured in China .	1
My 3 year old boy enjoys this jumbo puzzle . The puzzle has 24 large , thick pieces which were easy to fit together . The puzzle and box are sturdy , and the box has a convenient rope handle . The box was free from cardboard dust and shavings.I thought this puzzle was comparable to the Ravensburger puzzles that we have , and it is certainly better than other brands that you can buy at local box stores . As you can tell from the box , the animals are more cartoonish than realistic , but pleasant enough . Both sides , even the back , of the pieces have a laminated finish so they should hold up well . Recommended .	1
The At The Zoo Jumbo Puzzle by Mudpuppy is a delightful way to introduce your two and three year old to the joy of jigsaw puzzles . It has a bright and colorful illustration that is filled with charming animals , providing lots of things to talk about with your child . You can count penguins , peacocks and pandas while considering what flavor ice cream the zoo vendor might be offering ! The puzzle itself is expertly cut , eliminating the need to force pieces together . This one is easy to assemble since each of the animals is so well defined . The pieces are very thick , large , and easy to manipulate . The sturdy box with a handle is also a big plus ! The only thing that prevents me from giving this a five star rating is that after two assemblies , some of the corners of the pieces are already starting to crinkle and fray out a bit . This leads me to believe that they might not be of the sturdiest construction.This is a great puzzle and aside from the durability question , I would consider it a good investment for any toddler 's collection .	1
This is such a beautiful puzzle , filled with over a dozen different animals having a good time in their zoo . There 's an added special touch : the box doubles as a tote , with a blue cloth rope anchored through small metal eyelets on each side.Regarding quality , the puzzle 's soy-based inks are brilliantly colorful . The shiny surface of the puzzle will mirror surrounding light sources . The manufacturing process is noticeable , shown as slight bulges on several corners , but it does n't detract from the fun . The pieces are rigid , but feel somewhat easily flexible . The tote-style box , as cool as it is , can be bent with little effort - mine actually has a couple of dents from the pieces jostling about from within during shipping , though I give the product the same rating I would give were the box perfectly shaped.If I had this as a toddler , I 'd have loved this puzzle . I 'm guessing a chunk of the cost is for the rope handle , but then again , that 's one of this puzzle 's two charming attributes ; the other being the fun scene it depicts . Does it get any cuter than a penguin holding his nose as he drops , feet first , into the water ? Only if there 's an elephant giving a jubilant jaguar a bath on his back !	1
This puzzle is so sturdy . The pieces are about the size of a 4 yr old child 's hand . They are about 4 times thicker than typical kids puzzles . They box is even fun with a rope handle . When put together it measures 22 by 22 inches . The picture is just delightful of a day at the zoo . There are children in the picture , cotton candy man , balloons , even ice cream . Everything you can imagine to delight a child . It is for ages 2 and up I would say to age 5 or so.This is also a green item the grey board is 90 % recycled material , packaging 70 % recycled . All non toxic . The puzzle with withstand years of little hands playing even rough with this puzzle .	1
This was a very nice puzzle , the colors are bright , and the kids enjoyed putting it together . It fit well with their animal themed room and they enjoy pointing to the animals and making animal sounds when they complete the puzzle . I highly recommend .	1
I got this for my 18 month old nephew . He absolutely loved it . This puzzle provided him with about an hours worth of fun at a time . Considering he has a very short attention span , this was able to hold his attention . The pieces are very sturdy and colorful . What a great gift .	1
Where I work a variety of children of all ages come in so I keep a puzzle table near my desk . Many of the smaller preschoolers will give up on the puzzles that are 60 to 100 pieces but when I put this jumbo-piece puzzle out , they had a blast . The picture encourages success as it not too difficult to figure out where each piece goes . And the puzzle allows these smaller children to complete the puzzle before their parents are ready to leave . This puzzle fills the gap that I had at that end of the age/ability spectrum in my puzzle stash so I 'm quite happy with this addition . The pieces seem of average durability for puzzles and should go many rounds before showing real wear and tear . I think this is a good puzzle to get for children who are n't ready for the time-consuming concentration more complex puzzles require .	1
Tested by my 3 years & 2 months young grandson . I picked out 2 corners for him as starting points & he went on from there with very little help from me . His almost 2 years young sister was n't interested in trying this puzzle.The pieces are huge ! I measured two of them to give you a general idea of their size ... one was 7 '' x 4 1/2 '' . A corner piece measured 5 5/8 '' x 4 1/2 '' . Each sturdy piece has a nice shine & is approximately 1/8 '' thick.Another plus is the storage box which has a corded handle for carrying & even more importantly ... the box is roomy ! Meaning your child wo n't have to be extra careful getting the pieces back into the box . Oh my gosh , I remember the days when I 'd put my kids ' puzzles away & have to keep redoing it so the lid would close . Not so with this storage box , my grandson put the pieces away in no time flat & he did n't have to fiddle around getting them in just so.Nice quality puzzle ... 5 stars	1
We really like this puzzle . The pieces are big and bright and well constructed . It is a sturdy puzzle with extra thick cardboard . I feel like this puzzle is going to last us a long time . I will be buying more puzzles from this manufacturer .	1
This `` At the Zoo '' puzzle has a busy zoo scene with quite an an assortment of animals including some babies , a few visitors , and a cotton candy and ice cream vendor . The finished puzzle is 22 '' x 22 '' and it has 25 pieces that go together easily . The pieces are sturdy cardboard with glossy stock on both sides so they can be wiped with a damp cloth.This puzzle is most appropriate for older toddlers and up who wo n't chew on the cardboard although they may need a little help from an older sibling or parent . It provides a good learning experience before visiting a real zoo and offers the opportunity to teach not only animal names but the sounds they make , colors , counting , and the alphabet.The storage box is almost as much fun to play with as the puzzle itself . It has a rope handle and and easy-open tab . Put the puzzle pieces in the box , dump them out , put the puzzle pieces in the box , carry them around , dump them out -- the little ones are easily amused !	1
What cute graphics on this puzzle ! My animal loving girls ( 3 1/2yrs & 6yrs old ) were immediately drawn to this one.Super simple for my 6yr old to quickly complete but PERFECT for my 3 1/2yr old to tackle on her own ! It was just challenging enough for her to feel a sense of pride in completion . This is a great confidence builder for little ones new to jigsaw style puzzles.This was the perfect sized floor puzzle too and I appreciate the sturdy and appropriately sized box for storage.This one is a winner at our house and one chosen off the shelf more frequently than ourMelissa & Doug Pets Floor Puzzle - 24 PieceI 'll definitely keep the Mudpuppy puzzles in mind for gifts..perfect for 3 & 4yr olds !	1
Love Mudpuppy puzzles . Very cute puzzles , great for younger kids . My daughter is 4 and can do this independently . Would buy again .	1
Mudpuppy makes some great puzzles . I have always loved their packaging the box with the string handle to carry it around with and there 's no struggle to open or shut this box like my kids sometimes have if they do n't line it up right and ca n't get the lid on . The ability to carry this puzzle easily makes it great to travel with or take to grandmas as well.This puzzle `` At the Zoo '' is a fun open interpretation . It has lots of colors to draw your attention and the pieces are big and easy to handle and put in place . My three year old had lots of fun putting this together and seemed to be able to manage it mostly with just encouragement from me and not actual help.I would recommend `` At the Zoo '' or any of Mudpuppy 's many great floor puzzles for kids of all ages .	1
We 've gotten puzzles from this Mudpuppy company before , they always seem to make colorful , interesting , durable products that appeal to the little ones and are even aesthetically pleasing to the grownup in the house.With 25 pieces that form a 22 '' x22 '' puzzle , the target age range is probably 3-4 year olds , but the box says `` Ages 2+ '' . Five- or six-year-olds might get some enjoyment out of it , but not for long , my 6-year-old , for instasnce , has moved on to 100 piece puzzles.But , for the little ones , there is a lot of variety in the art , animals to talk about , sturdy pieces that fit together well ... . what 's not to love ?	1
This puzzle is nice treat for all the little ones . Easy to put together as well as holds its place when done . The colors are bright and vivid , and the kids come alive after it is done . Will help kids with learning colors as well as animals too . Something you can discuss with children when they are finished . overall a great puzzle and kids will interact with it as well .	1
My 3 year old daughter LOVES animals , so this puzzle was a hit from the moment I pulled it out of the box . The actual box it comes in has a nice flap top and it has a rope handle which makes it easy to carry around . The puzzle itself is shiny cardboard . The picture has great colors and is very bright . My only complaint is that the pieces did n't fit together easily unless you 're on a perfectly flat surface ( We tried to put it together on the carpet and we had a hard time getting everything to fit into the each other ) . It 's a fun puzzle and great for toddlers !	1
This is a great children 's puzzle . The picture is adorable and will inspire a lot of questions about animals . The puzzle itself is imprinted on that thick multi-layered , non-corrugated cardboard - the layers may start to peel with much use , but the pieces fit together surprisingly crisply , with an audible snap and no puzzle dust left behind . The box is bigger than it needs to be to hold the pieces , which is about my only knit pick .	1
The pictures are fun and engaging . After the puzzle is together there are lots of counting and identification that can take place.The pieces are large and thick . So they are easy for little hands to grasp . Most of the pieces are boarders so putting together is easy.It is cardboard so expect some wear and tear ... however looks like it will wear well . The biggest danger is to durability is probably a mouth .	1
This jumbo puzzle is almost , but not quite , on par with Ravensburger products . I consider it equal to or slightly better when compared to Melissa and Doug products , which are also a high quality producer and probably the closest competitor . Everything from the box to the puzzle pieces indicate a decent build quality . The large puzzle pieces are rigid enough and made of quality material but not as thick as Ravensburger . They do not appear coated like Ravensburger products either ; though they have a glossy sheen . However , the manufacturer indicates the product is made with soy based ink , a non-toxic alternative , making it safe for those children that are teething.Usability was engineered for little hands and minds . These puzzles teach basic problem solving logic and seem to thrill most kids I know , although they never thrilled me as a child . The artwork is relatively simple and should not frustrate children . The box provides a great storage place for the pieces and unlike traditional boxes , it includes a carrying handle.As other reviewers noted , the Ravensburger puzzles can sometimes be bought at a lower cost . If this is possible , I would choose Ravensburger . Otherwise , I believe this puzzle is decent quality and targets 2 to 4 year olds . Older children seem to like Ravensburger given the choice .	1
This is a very well made little puzzle . The word 'Jumbo ' in the product title refers to the size of the puzzle pieces - not to the size of the puzzle - and the pieces are very well sized for little hands . The illustration is bright , beautiful , and has lots of great ( and funny ) little details that my daughter enjoyed finding.As for the pieces , they also seem to be very durable . They fit together well and seem like they 'll take a lot of four-year-old abuse - they can stand up to my daughter 's favorite game of dancing on her puzzles after completing them.Her only complaint was the size of the puzzle . Although the size is clearly noted in the product description , the puzzle is much smaller than the other puzzles we have.All in all , a lovely puzzle that we 'll enjoy over and over again .	1
My kids are 4 and 6 and they just love puzzles , so when that Amazon box arrived my kids jumped with joy ! The pieces are big and bright and great for hand and eye coordination . Its enough pieces to make them slow down and think , but not so many that they become overwhelmed and frustrated.Overall it is a great puzzle I highly recommend it !	1
This puzzle is full of cute animal illustrations , ranging from penguins to elephants to monkeys and peacocks . The colors really pop to attract young children 's eyes . The large pieces are easy for small hands to put together , or take apart .	1
First , the packaging is fantastic ! I love the blue rope handle , allowing my kids ( 3 and 5 ) to carry the puzzle easily without dumping all the pieces . The two other jumbo puzzles we have are in boxes that are much more challenging for the kids to hold and carry . I ca n't count the number of times they 've gotten frustrated before even starting a puzzle because they have to pick up the pieces two or three times first.The pieces are thicker and had a glossier image than I expected . Each piece almost the size of my hand with fingers extended . The pieces fit together perfectly without difficulty for my three-year-old son and five-year-old daughter . My son still needs help with big puzzles , but my daughter can do them without help ( and can help her brother ) .When finished , the finished image is colorful and fun cartoon of the zoo , with a bit of a quirky feel to it.I expect this to hold up for a long time , and - as compared to other brands of jumbo puzzles that we have - this one is a clear winner because the kids can carry it independently with the perfect packaging and handle .	1
My 2 1/2 year old daughter absolutely loves this jumbo puzzle . We received it yesterday , and she played with it for the majority of the evening . The colors are bright and engaging , and the pieces are made of a seemingly durable cardboard.It is a little difficult to put together on our plush carpeting , but it works great on a hard floor . The puzzle comes in a sturdy storage box which has a thin rope carry handle .	1
The only reason to not buy this product for your child is if they still have n't quite figured out jigsaw puzzles . This is a classic jigsaw puzzle , the shapes bearing no relationship to the pictures.But if your kid can handle jigsaw puzzles , i highly recommend this one . The pieces are thick and sturdy , the tabs fit securely into the notches without being so snug as to put up a fight . The puzzle , once assembled , is study enough for a cat to walk across without knocking it apart , even on a carpeted floor . The picture is colorful and silly , with animals playing in normal ways ( penguins sliding on their bellies ) or silly ways ( a polar bear cub floating in a red inner tube ) . Once the puzzle is assembled , you can play name-that-animal , or challenge your child to make up a story about what 's going on in the picture . Or you can just take it apart and put it together again.The box is sturdy and designed as a carrying case , so the disassembled puzzle can easily be carried by a child , to a friend 's house or preschool or just another room in your house .	1
My three year old son loves this puzzle and has put it together every day for the last week . It is bright and colorful with cute illustrations of animals at the zoo . It is age-appropriate for two to four year olds . I usually help my son put it together by giving him hints on what pieces might work if he gets stuck , but overall it is not difficult for him . The puzzle has 25 pieces , is a 5 by 5 square , and is fairly large . The pieces are large , seem durable , and go together easily . The box is also cute with a carry handle , which allows my son to tote it between rooms and encourages cleaning up after putting it together . Overall , I have to say this a great puzzle for toddlers and young children .	1
Loved the theme of the puzzle as I can teach my child about real life animals ; definitely of educational value . The puzzle 's quality is quite strong and seems pretty durable as it is made from a thick cardboard . Wished the puzzle came along with a 'trace-along ' folded piece so that it can be easier for a toddler to manage on their own.Overall , a fun , educational and colourful puzzle for any child .	1
This jigsaw puzzle has colorful cartoon-like illustrations of animals , ranging from pandas , flamingos , polar bears and monkeys to penguins , turtles , lions , elephants , and peacocks . There are even several children in the picture . The colors are striking and it will be fun for kids not only to put this puzzle together , but to identify the assorted animals along the way.Gauged for children 2 years and older , the puzzle contains 25 pieces , which should make it a reasonable challenge for little ones without frustrating them or taxing their concentration span . It 's a fun activity for a cold or rainy day and one that involves motor coordination , visual acuity , and problem solving , so for parents concerned about having their kids learn while they 're having fun , this item fills the bill . The puzzle can be enjoyed alone , with a parent , or with a friend.Packaged in a sturdy cardboard box with a cloth handle , the puzzle pieces -- when fully assembled -- measure 22 inches X 22 inches . For kids , it might also be fun to play a `` Where 's Waldo '' type game in which the child is asked to locate specific animals or objects . My granddaughter loves locating objects in storybook illustrations , and she was just as focused on finding the toucan , the rabbit , and the girl with the camera in the puzzle picture .	1
This is great puzzle for little hands . Colorful pieces and that are easy for young ones to grab and figure out where they go . The animal illustration is very cute ( which just a touch of quirk to it ) to make it a unique addition to your puzzle library .	1
When you are three-five years old , puzzles are either too babyish ( ie . the shaped board puzzles ) or too hard to keep your interest . This puzzle was just right for preschoolers . There are 24 large , sturdy cardboard puzzle pieces in the box to make a 22x22 perfectly squared puzzle . The cute zoo design keeps things rolling as kids enjoy each piece . The first time your preschoolers attempt the puzzle , it will take them a little more time . It can be a little frustrating to learn how to piece something together so I like to turn it into a game of seek and find . As one puzzle piece is discovered , I give hints about the matching piece . I will definitely be hunting down more puzzles like this one to help the kiddos graduate from board puzzles into more challenging kid puzzles . What a great way to stimulate growth in cognitive and motor skills ! The only down side I could see is while the puzzle pieces are large ( about 3-4 '' ) and sturdy , they are made from cardboard and thus can be bent and get creases when children step on them accidentally , or if the puzzle pieces are mishandled/mistreated .	1
Nice puzzle , pretty colors , and the pieces are big enough for a smaller child to play with . Comes with a handle so it is easy to transport . We had fun putting it together !	1
We gave this to our 27 month old for Christmas as her first jigsaw puzzle . The box is colorful , durable and easy to carry . The pieces are the perfect size for her hands . The puzzle has the animals she likes to name . She is too young yet to stay committed to the puzzle , but I have high hopes this will be a favorite in a few more months . Our 5 year old did it easily for her , so I think the right age is probably 3 -4 on this where it is a challenge , but doable .	1
This is a nice colourful puzzle , with a simple design for youngsters 2 years and up - probably to about 4 or 5 years . The 25 pieces are big ; each is about 4 '' x 4 '' . What is good is that the top edge of each puzzle piece is slightly rounded on the edges , which will help keep the picture from peeling away . However the pieces , themselves could be thicker , so that young hands would not be able to bend them so easily.The box is relatively solid and with care will last . Although , the cardboard ` catch ' to keep it closed starts to show signs of wear after a few uses . The cord is soft and makes it easy to carry the puzzle box.It does seem a bit pricey at this time , for such a simple puzzle .	1
There tactile letters were exactly what I was looking for . Great for those that do a version of Montessori at home . They fit the bill and are at least $ 10 cheaper than what you can find elsewhere . Also , I rarely see packs with both the upper and lower case letters . A great value and a fun way to practice pre-writing skills with young children .	1
These letters are great for teaching children finger tracing . They were smaller than what I wanted but ended up being perfect . You can use them in many ways that will work for teaching your kids sounds and letters . The applications are endless ! Plus , I thought the letter shapes fit well with the Handwriting Without Tears program my son 's school teaches from .	1
My children enjoyed tracing the letters at 3-1/2 to 4 years of age . At 4-1/2 , they have moved on , so I got about 6-9 monhts of use out of these . The cards are high-quality , made on card stock with sandpaper-like material where the letters are . I would hold their fingers and trace along the letters the first few times , then they took over on their own after that . Using the cards was a good foundation to help them learn to write their letters later .	1
I think these will be useful for us but are smaller than I had expected . I should have read the product description more closely so that 's on me -- they 're just smaller than I was picturing.The cards themselves are about 3 1/2 by 2 3/4 inches . The letters are 1 1/4 by 2 inches and fairly narrow -- the sandpaper is only about 1/4 inch wide . They are made out of cardstock , but it 's a heavy duty cardstock and feels fairly sturdy . They 're heavier than what you 'd get on a playing card or a flashcard . The quality is reasonable for the price.At any rate , I think they are a good tactile tool for learning letters and phonics . My son likes tracing the letters with his finger . Today we played memory with the capital and lowercase letters . I was also able to get a good crayon rubbing with them . Although they are smaller than I had thought they would be I think they will prove to be worth the purchase . It 's a good choice if you do n't want to invest in the higher quality but more expensive Montessori style letters .	1
We were thrilled to find Acquire finally ; my husband grew up loving this game . Ordered it for my brother . The game requires strategy , planning , and never ends the same way . It is a classic , must-have addition for any game closet . It 's a little more time intensive , and the board is n't as flashy as newer games , but hey -- it is exciting to play . It 's all about the acquisitions .	1
If you have never played , do n't let the reviews turn you off . This is a wonderful , mind working game.Many people liked the version with the 3-d peices because they do n't get bumped ... but if you play on a table and are n't trying to hold a baby at the same time or have a cat that likes to jump on games ( which are valid concerns ) , then this version will do fine . I 'm not really certain why some people keep buying each version , unless they collect or their old one is worn out from many a good time.I personally have been waiting for a `` flat '' version . I found that the 3-d version was unnecessarily bulky ( they could have made a better `` locking system '' if they wanted a bump free version ) , the pieces were too big to throw into a drawstring bag and draw from ( I 'd rather not have to turn them all upside down and then make room for all the bulky upside down pieces to take up half my table ) , and the peices were too bulky to easily conceal from the other players.. we had to all get shoe boxes , or keep them upside down and remember exactly which pieces we had.So all and all , I actually prefer this one . You will have a distinct advantage if you have the type of mind that can keep track of how many of what each player buys.Not the best to play with young players because decisions they make can effect everyone else ... which is good if they fully understand why they are doing it and what effect it will have , but if they do n't , then it really is a bummer when they mess things up for you ( and it does n't even help them ) .	1
Whenever I see this game on my shelf , I get a disturbing visual of Quark 's big head from Star Trek : Deep Space Nine . I then picture him playing Tongo with a bunch of other Ferengi ... a game that deals with buying , selling , acquiring , and other things you 'd normally see on the Wall Street floor . Do n't ask me why ... I have n't had my coffee yet this morning.Acquire : 3-6 Players , Ages 12+ , Average Play Time : 60 to 90 Minutes*Note : While the box says that the game is for three to six players , I do n't see why a two player variant could n't exist ... if one does n't already . I 'm fairly confident that two players with an imagination who are not concerned about following the rulebook to the letter could make do . I also came across the older Avalon Hill version 's rulebook and there is a section for special rules for two players ... so feel free to experiment.Acquire plays a bit differently than the other games I 've played . The closest comparison I could possibly make to what I 've already reviewed is Airlines Europe . In both games , you 're buying stock and whoever has more of certain stocks / colors often reaps the biggest reward when payouts occur . More on that in a minute.Version & ComponentsThe version of Acquire I purchased is the latest print of the game , by Wizards of the Coast.I need to get this pet peeve of mine out of the way before I begin . The player tile trays are made of fairly cheap cardboard that you have to punch out and bend to make the pieces assemble . In other words , I had a fun time trying to assemble the player tile trays . In most games I 've purchased , tile trays came assembled and were of much better quality.Some people may not mind the extra work and the game is fairly cheaper than your average Euro-style board game , but c'mon ... would it have hurt profits that much to just make the components a little better ? Also , the player reference tables were part of the manual itself that I had to cut / tear out . For OCD people like me , the manual just does n't look right now that pages look torn out of it . I do n't see why they could n't have printed reference sheets separate of the manual.Previous versions of the game were much nicer looking and of better quality , so much in fact that other reviewers recommend trying to find those older printed versions as opposed to this one . I do n't mind average to poor production values if the price is right , but this is just pushing it.Game MechanicsThe game board is made of up of squares that form a grid , going from 1A in the upper left hand corner all the way to 12I in the lower right hand corner . To the left of the grid are the available corporations that players can form and to the right is the same reference chart you 'll find in the cutouts in the back of the manual.In Acquire , turns are fairly simple . Players place a tile , players buy up to three stocks , and finally players pick up a new tile from the supply . Tiles correspond to the squares / grid on the board ... for example ... you 'd place the 1A tile if you had it onto the 1A square on the board / grid.When a player places a tile next to an existing tile sitting by itself , that player gets to form a corporation . It does n't become their 's mind you , but they do get a free stock card for establishing it . That player can choose any of the available corporations ... though some grow differently than others . Some corporations are cheap to buy stocks for early on but do n't pay out as much when they grow in size while others are expensive to buy stocks for early on but payout is big in the endgame.Players continue placing tiles , forming / growing corporations , and buying stock cards until a tile is placed that causes two corporations to bump heads . This is the real meat and potatoes of the game . A few things happen when this occurs.1 ) The larger corporation acquires or `` eats up '' the smaller one . If the purple corporation for example had six tiles and green had three tiles , purple would acquire green . The exception to the rule is if both corporations are eleven tiles are higher in size . Corporations with eleven tiles or more are considered `` safe . `` 2 ) The player who owns the most stock cards in the company that was acquired gains the one time majority shareholder bonus . The amount varies depending on how big the corporation actually is . The player who owns the second most stock cards of the company that was acquired receives the one time minority shareholder bonus . Sorry , but there is n't a prize here for third place , unless there is a tie for second place.3 ) Players who own stock in the company that was acquired have a choice to make.- They can sell their stock for cash now , the amount depending on how big the corporation is.- They can trade that stock on a 2 to 1 basis for stock of the company that acquired it.- They can keep their stock , hoping the corporation will form again down the line.The acquired company marker gets put back to its place on the side of the board and can be formed again later on.At the end of the game , shareholder bonuses are given out to the companies that are on the board and their stocks are traded in for cash . The winner is the player with the most money after that is all said and done.The ReviewAll three kids joined me to form a four player game . Explaining the rules was n't as bad as I thought it would be . I was concerned that the whole buying stocks and acquiring would overwhelm the eleven year old , but ironically he ended up winning the game . He randomly bought stock so that he 'd try to have more than everyone else , which ended up working out to his advantage unbeknownst to him.I focused on buying stocks for two corporations in the middle of the board and would have made a lot of money had one acquired the other ... but they ended up becoming `` safe '' and I did n't have much money left to buy stocks in other corporations that could still be acquired . I received a nice bonus at the end of the game for all the stock I had , but my son used the money he earned from his acquisitions to buy even more stock than what I had bought up cheaply in the beginning of the game ... so he ended up getting the majority shareholder bonus anyway . He earned so much from a particular acquisition that he just started buying out ALL of the stock cards of particular colors until there were none left.It seems to pay to have money throughout the game and not to focus on one or two corporations , unless you are sure they will pay out . I was tempted to offer him a later bed time if he 'd slip me ten grand , but I thought better of it . The game took us about two hours to play ... keep in mind , there was a learning curve and three kids of varying ages involved.Overall , I really enjoyed the game . Acquire is simple enough to learn but deep enough that players can form strategies in order to outdo the other . The random tile placement throughout the game by players keeps the replayability high . I quickly forgot about the quality of the player tile trays when I started playing out scenarios in my head on how certain corporations might play out on the board.The kids were actively working out aloud which corporations they planned to grow and were constantly comparing how many stock cards they had of certain colors . They were often on the edge of their seats when a merger occured ... anxious to see how it would play out . The older ones took it a step further and bought out stock in the growing corporations , recognizing how much money they could make when it grows even bigger . The younger one just bought what he could afford and random chance worked in his favor . They all stated that they enjoyed playing the game.I personally recommend Acquire if you enjoy games with a financial theme to them , in this case , stocks and money . I recommend that players have a calculator handy , especially for the endgame . The poor production values ( when compared to versions previous to it ) might turn some people off , but I 'd recommend putting that aside in your mind to enjoy the game for what it really is .	1
great game , not stale ... kept us busy and entertained . No two games is ever the same ... We enjoyed it for sure .	1
Acquire may not be as old as Monopoly , but it is older than me and I can see why it 's a classic . Finally , an economic game that is far better than monopoly could ever hope to be ! I know a lot of people who have owned older versions are upset at the quality of the components compared to earlier versions and rightly so , but really , the game just rocks ! Buy this cheaper version to play , and then go buy an older expensive version to store in your closet , so you can be an Acquire snob saying you have version 19xx something : - ) Acquire is a game about investing in hotel chains and getting the most money in the end , similar to Monopoly , but that is about where the similarity ends . The game does a wonderful job of creating the experience of investing in stock , simulating growth in value as the hotel chain grows , merging , and fighting to be primary stockholder for huge payouts on mergers . The gameplay is brilliantly simple , but the strategy and decision making can go way deep ! It is done in such a way that the word elegance comes to mind . Even though there is luck involved in the way you draw tiles for this game , I at least get to choose where I want to move by placing a tile . Whereas in Monopoly , you have to move where the die tells you ( roll 'n move ) which aggravates me.In this game you perform 3 simple actions : place a tile , buy up to three stocks , and then draw another tile . When I place a tile , I can decide if I want help grow a hotel chain ( do n't have to own it ) , create a hotel chain , or merge a hotel chain . After that , I have to decide on which hotel chain on the board I want to buy stock . This is where things get interesting , because you know that if you own the most stock in a hotel chain that gets gobbled up in a merger , you 'll get some major moolah . Of course the bigger the chain is when it gets gobbled , the bigger the payout is . So , you may finding yourself trying to weigh out when you should merge the hotel chain if someone does n't do it first and whether or not you grow it . Again , there 's a risk involved , because if a hotel chain gets beyond 11 tiles , it is safe from acquisition . If that happens and you 're a major stockholder , then you 'll keep growing that `` safe '' hotel chain for the big payout at the end of the game . When mergers happen , you also have to decide if you should trade your stock in for the new hotel , sell your old stock , or keep it for when you decide to start the old chain back up again . The game has a lot of subtle strategy as you try to weigh out how you grow a hotel chain or merge it , based on how much stock you own in it or how much someone else has invested in it.Acquire is just a beautifully designed game and is a lot of fun to play . This is a great way to teach your kids about investing in stock too !	1
I grew up playing Monopoly . Lots of people did . It 's unfortunate , because there was this gem just sitting there , begging to be played , but passed over . Here 's what was missed : THEMEThe game is about buying and selling stock in hotel chains , causing chains to merge , and go in and out of business . Given that virtually NONE of this is represented visually and it looks more like a Bingo board , the theme really stands out . You really feel like you 're doing exactly what the game says you are.COMPONENTSThis is where the game takes a hit . If you can , see if you can pick up one of the versions from the 1960 's or 1970 's . Those were VERY well made and , as long as you do n't need them to be in perfect shape , can be come across for very little . If you can get one of those , the components are perfectly good.GAMEPLAYYou have a handful of tiles marked like a bingo board and one central & # 34 ; bingo board. & # 34 ; Every turn , you play a tile to the corresponding spot on the board . If it is adjacent to another tile that is n't already a company , you get to start a new company . If it 's adjacent to another company , that company just grows . If it 's on its ' own , nothing happens . You can then buy some stock in companies which exist , draw back up to a full hand of tiles , and turn progresses.SOUNDS BASIC , WHAT MAKES THIS SPECIAL ? Glad you asked . There 's a few twists:1 ) There 's a chart which shows the value of a company and the price of its ' stock . The more tiles a company is , the more it 's worth , and the more it costs to buy stock . So , you want to invest more in a company , but also want to grow it ? You either need to wait until next turn to grow it ( during which , everyone else gets a shot at it ) or you need to grow it now and pay more.2 ) When 2 companies ' tiles touch , they merge . Having the most ( and 2nd most ) stock gets you cash bonuses , and then you can keep the stock for the company ( as it might open back up ) or trade it in for money or other stock . Being in the right spot to take advantage of those is a HUGE component to the game.3 ) After a company gets so large , it becomes & # 34 ; safe & # 34 ; in that it ca n't be bought out anymore . Getting in on the stock of safe companies is huge , because those companies just keep growing and growing , getting more and more valuable.SO WHY SHOULD I PLAY THIS INSTEAD OF MONOPOLYA few reasons:1 ) There 's a fairly small rule set , so anyone old and smart enough to pick up on strategy for Monopoly can pick this up.2 ) It teaches the same principles of investing in the right things at the right time . Only unlike Monopoly , you do n't have so much money that you can just buy everything . You need to make a choice of what and when to buy.3 ) There 's still an amount of randomness , and you might have things to do even when it 's not your turn.4 ) It 's a MUCH shorter game . The game ends when either one company grows too far or every company on the board is & # 34 ; safe. & # 34 ; Generally , this is about 45 mins or so , unlike Monopoly , which can last 2-3 hours.5 ) For kids , it is a much better teaching tool . It can still teach addition/subtraction just as well , only now it can teach multiplication ( & # 34 ; I 'm selling 5 shares for 300 a share , how much is that ? & # 34 ; ) , and chance in investments ( every investment is n't always a good one ) .6 ) There 's no electronic version with a debit card.FINAL THOUGHTSAcquire is a very good , fairly short , light-medium weight game . It 's good for a wide range of ages and , especially compared to it 's age and what other board games were at the time , it 's incredibly well-designed and strategic .	1
It 's a fun game . A lot of strategy and every game is different so it has great replay value . It 's a classic .	1
Played for the first time yesterday with 4 players . Took a few minutes to get everyone up to par with the instructions but flow picks up quickly . Many levels of strategy involved such as when to buy shares in what chain and whether or not block mergers to prevent competitors from cashing in on appreciated stock values . Kept everyone engaged throughout and the intensity picks up at the end when trying to decide whether or not to initiate the end of game play . My one complaint would be that previous iterations of Acquire had grooved slots on the board so that the tiles would not shift when others are being placed . Minor complaint but newer versions need to address it . Overall it is highly recommended .	1
Older Dungeons and Dragons fans are often pressed for time to enjoy their sword-swinging swashbuckling . And Wizards of the Coast is trying to treat them ( and everyone else ) to a game that requires less time , but just as much fun.In this game , you walk through various random tiles that spawn monsters and events using pre-built characters . You have a quest to finish ( like `` get to room X and kill the bad guy '' ) and dozens of bad guys in the way.Each player is on the same side and has a set of skills vital to the success of the mission . The fighter might stand in front while engaging bad guys with the healing cleric while a wizard exacts utter destruction over the baddies.Everyone feels like they are vital to the game . Everyone has a ton of fun.Lastly , I should mention that the creatures generally have 1 or 2 or 3 hit points , not 40 or 80 or 200 . So the math is easier and the game plays faster than standard DnD encounters.If you want to have some hack-n-slash fun with a board game , then get this today . You wo n't regret it .	1
Played this a few times with friends . While borrowing some concepts from DnD ( or any dungeon game really ) , it is definitely not as intricate as actual DnD and way more visceral . The scenarios in the book provide a nice , gradual increase in difficulty and some story/game element variety for each play session . There are a lot of pieces and depending on the scenario you choose , you may use very little or a lot of them . The figures are very good and we even used a few of them in our actual DnD games : P. Gameplay wise , the random tiles are a nice feature and the characters have some neat abilities . I personally like this game , but it is indeed a very simplified version of core DnD mechanics . Overall , a fun game to pull out every once in a while when you feel like plundering a dungeon .	1
Played this both by myself and with my friends about fifteen times now . It is quite fun and the models are cool . There are a few broken game mechanics that make it almost too easy , and I wish that the role-played aspect was a little deeper ( leveling up , for instance ) . Otherwise enjoyable .	1
I was never much for Role Playing Games , but this board game intrigued me so I checked it out . In & # 34 ; Castle Ravenloft & # 34 ; players take on the roles of various fantasy characters from the D & D universe as they attempt to infiltrate the castle of the evil vampire Count Strahd in various scenarios . Players explore the castle 's dungeon by laying tiles room by room , not unlike in & # 34 ; Betrayal at House on the Hill. & # 34 ; The game is loaded with really cool creature miniatures- everything from rats to a skeleton dragon to the evil Strahd himself . As dungeon crawl board games go , & # 34 ; Castle Ravenloft & # 34 ; easily holds its own with easy to learn rules , a beautiful production , and engaging play . A great game from start to finish .	1
Great game for several reasons1 . Fully cooperative game with a 20 sided dice , cards , modular and random game board , and a host of miniatures that represent both heroes AND monsters/bosses.2 . Can combine with the Wrath of Ashardalon game or Dungeon Command games ' miniatures3 . RPG-lite . No huge time investment or setup needed like the real D & D ; RPGs , though it could be considered a negative if you were looking for a deep character development system and role playing experience , but if you were you should n't look at board games in the first place .	1
In the spirit of full disclosure I am a HUGE Ravenloft fanatic . I have the original D & D ; Module , the box sets ( TWO of them ! ) I have read the book ( I , Strahd : The Memoirs of a Vampire ) and spent countless hours playing through ( and dying in ) Count Strahd 's castle and lands . I love this whole series.So , I now have a son who is interested in D & D . ; Mainly because he knows how much I enjoyed it `` back in the day '' and having seen the guys on Big Bang Theory playing it recently . Searching the internet for an easy way to break in to D & D ; brings me to the board game Dungeons and Dragons Wrath of Ashardalon . As I read the description ( or maybe it was a review ) I notice that there is a Ravenloft version ! I check it out , see the good reviews and buy it.Boy was I ever NOT disappointed ! This game is great . All the fun of D & D ; without the need to read a ton of books ( yes , in this game there is a fair amount of reading , but not too bad ) or roll a character or keep track of too much . Yes , some hard-core D & D ; people may find it a little limited and too easy , but if that is the case , just play D & D ; on your own . This game is much better for the first-timers and the uninitiated . Very easy to play and not a lot of time invested to get there . I mean , it 's probably on par with like a good game of Risk or a real game of Monopoly ( without all the shortcuts . ) Great for board game enthusiasts and the D & D ; curious.The game itself is really something . Very well-made in every way . Good game board tiles , great cards and tokens and players and monsters too . All very durable and cool . Since purchasing , I have played about five games . Once by myself to see if it was any fun alone ( it actually is ) and a bunch of games with my son and some others . Every time was fun , even when we lost ( some of the dungeons can be very hard ! ) and I ca n't wait to play more.I highly recommend this game if you are looking for a fun board game with friends for a few hours and you like the idea of D & D ; without all the books and commitment .	1
I need not make my review too long ; just go to boardgamegeek and read the forums/reviews -- the fact is , this game is more about buying the pieces , the tokens , the tiles , etc . and then you have a real fun game system to make it your own . The base rules are good , really , but if you stop there you might end up feeling like the game is too mechanical . Go concot yourself a variant ( if that 's not your style , just go crib someone 's and do n't question it much ) and the game takes on new life . The adventures are long enough to play for a long time ( even by yourself ! ) ... and then online there are tons of adventures ! So yes 5/5 .	1
I just got this and played it a few times solo . If you are looking for good games to play when there is n't anyone to play with , this is a great one . My current favorite solo game is Arkham Horror and this game is almost as good.The gameplay involves creating a random dungeon from a large selection of heavy interlocking cardboard tiles . You need a good size table . Your band of up to 5 heroes co-operate to explore the dungeon on a set quest adventure . 13 are included in the adventure booklet . After a few games making up your own quest wo n't be too hard . The dungeon is created as you go so the layout will be different every time you play . The rules are fairly simple and should be easily picked up by even young kids.A nice selection of miniatures in different colors for all the heroes and monsters are included . Each of the adventures requires different unique items , monsters , tokens or cards that are all provided giving the game a large selection of props to create adventures . The card selection is good , I used about half the decks during the first couple of adventures.Everything in the game is well made except the cards . The edges of these were roughed up after the first game . They are cheap cardboard stock and not as well made as what most other game manufacturers use which are more like playing cards.Bottom line : great single or multi-player co-operative board game with good replay value for 1 to 5 players	1
The amount of stuff you get with this game makes the purchase well worth it . There are a ton of game pieces . The game itself takes a while to hang of but is a lot of fun once you do . Game has lots of replay due to the randomness of the tiles .	1
Dungeons and Dragons has been around for years . They have had multiple rule updates , and this game is based off of the more recent changes . It plays as a simplified version that is perfect for introducing new players to the series and game play style . My wife who would have never dreamed she would enjoy something Dungeon and Dragons related actually really enjoys this game.It has 13 different scenarios which are like individual games within it . They all come together to form a complete story . You and your band of heroes are trying to protect the town of Bavoria and defeat the lord vampire Strahd . The game is played on a board that grows as you journey the dungeon and is randomized so even playing the same scenario should provide a different experience.In a regular turn you move , explore a new area , fight some monsters and then bring new monsters into the game . There are traps , different environment hazards , and treasure and items to collect and help you out.The game at its core is a story . It has decent combat and the way it handles monsters keeps the game at a decent pace and does not allow it to lull or slow down . But the theme and the story are what drives you . In the last game my wife and I had to find a alter in the dungeon and recover a holy artifact and then escape . The game has a prepared reading to set the mood , and then another once you find the alter . It gets you into the game and makes that quest unique even though you are doing the same thing as in others . If you gloss over the stuff like this and just focus on moving and rolling dice you may not enjoy this game . You have to get into your roles and use your imagination just like in a real game of Dungeons and Dragons.The game comes with miniatures to help with this , little statues for all the players and monsters . They are not painted , but the details are pretty good and it is easy to distinguish between them . There are also tons of tokens for monitoring your life , as well as pretty much anything else the game does . At first it seems overwhelming but it becomes second nature after only a few turns.I have enjoyed this game so far , it works very well as a single player game also which is a plus . It has 2 scenarios specific for this , but it is not so complicated that you can not play 2 heroes at once either . Each game lasts around a hour , and set up takes 10 minutes or so . I would recommend some card protectors as this game is card heavy . While everything is constructed well and appears very durable , a little extra protection never hurts .	1
I love D & D Ravenloft . My favorite character was Lord Soth , the Knight of the Black Rose . Well , he is n't in this game . It 's a different story . Many other reviews already posted most key features and fun of this game . The key point for me to say being many years D & D player , I still want to join the group , but time is the key concern after getting old with busy job . This is the one of the good solution for me to enjoy quick D & D . It combines both D & D RPG and D & D Miniature games with simple character and monster card plus miniatures and you can play as 1 player up to 5 players . Yes , 1 players . That 's the key for me to join the advanture alone or in group with different fun and good time . Nice game .	1
Great game that plays well enough like 4th edition . Very suspenseful , and NEVER the same game twice ! Grab some friends and dive into Ravenloft !	1
Good game . Do n't be afraid of all the pieces , it 's not that bad . The rules could be a little clearer in places , but there 's lots of unofficial erratta on the interweb that addresses them . The box art is kinda weak , but it 's what 's on the inside that counts .	1
Once I opened the box and unpacked everything I was ecstatic . The tiles are nice and thick so they should hold up well to countless replays . The mini 's are great and as far as I can tell , it 's all compatible with the RPG game . I foresee me running encounters and campaigns using the components from all 3 boxes . Great buy .	1
Let '' s face it- D & D ; Ravenloft campaign setting was extremely nasty.You could suffer ill effects just from being there ! Yes the Castle Ravenloft boardgame is extremely nasty , too . The encounter cards actually put more fear in my heart than the monsters did , since a black arrow on a tile meams you must resolve an encounter card AND a monster card.I 've only yet played the first solo scenario three times and been crushed three times . One encounter card called for a monster to be activated on every unexplored map tile edge . This led to FOUR monsters being activated and another activated for placing the tile itself . This led to highly masochisticly amusing chase where running away caused more tiles to be placed , more monsters activated , more dreaded encounter cards.In the end , Count Von Strahd activated , chased me down , put me out of my misery . If this sounds like fun , buy this game NOW . Personally , I find the brutality of Castle Ravenloft refreshing . Unfair at times ? Yes . Over the top at times ? Yes . A DM I used to play with used Ravenloft setting as a purgatory for annoying players . If someone was rude or disruptive , all this DM had to do was say the word `` Ravenloft '' and they would adjust thier behavior . This boardgame adaptation of Ravenloft is true to the campaign world it is based upon .	1
This is a very fun game , and a great introduction to the mechanics of D & D RPGs and actually it served as a basics refresher for me having not played D & D since I was a kid . The tiles and figures add to the theme 's feel . Arguably the tiles could have been illustrated with more detail and variety ( I 'm thinking of Descent 's gorgeous tiles ) , but they 're pretty nice and made from a sturdy stock . The figures are fantastic , except for ( disappointingly ) , Vlad himself , who looks the furthest thing from imposing , especially when compared to the bone dragon or any of the heroes . Kinda looks like Seth Green wearing clothes that are too big for him , unfortunately . Gameplay is not terribly complicated but you will have to invest a little time with the rulebook ( or fans ' youtube videos ) , especially if you 've had no D & D experience . Once you do , the game is immensely fun and satisfying , and the creepy theme really shines ( oozes ? ) through , but I will warn you it is challenging . You will find yourself cheating a bit in the first few games , because you did n't realize you should have done some other action prior but did n't know the game well enough , or just because it 's a hard game but you want to go a little further to see what 's ahead . For example in the first solo game , the game ends when you finally get to the Secret Staircase . If you 're lucky enough to have this tile be at the top of your stack , you 're golden . You 'll fight a few monsters and win . But more often than not , you 'll be turning over tile after tile and the monsters do n't stop coming . You 'll be wondering where that # $ ^ $ ^ tile is . If it 's near the bottom , you 're screwed ( and I hope you have enough table space . There are a dozen or so missions , with varying difficulty and objectives and there are even a couple you can download from their website . And like all D & D there 's nothing stopping you from making up your own . It 's a fantastic game , that 's fun with others or even by yourself as you 'll discover when you do that first mission just to learn the game . Trying to decide if I want to buy the other two games in this series or if they 're too similar , but I 'm having a great time with Ravenloft .	1
I am new to Dungeons & Dragons concept so I wanted something fairly simple that I can play with kids.I love this game because it : - is easy to understand from good manual- pieces and board are of good quality- it comes with over dozen of adventure stories- with adult around even kids as young as 7 years can learn it pretty quickly- because you can combine pieces in any manner you can create your own games easily	1
I got this game from a local shop and I must say I wish I would 've known this was on amazon because its way cheaper . The game is super fun and to anyone that is even just a little bit interested in buying it DO IT ! Wrath of Ashardalon is that fun and even more so when you have a full 5 people to play .	1
Wrath of Ashardalon gets everything right for a dungeon crawl board game . I 'll break down all of the great highlights : Set-Up -- -- -- You divide out cards and characters . You put a start tile down , then you 're ready to go . Super easy and fast.Rules -- -- -If you are familiar with playing Dungeons and Dragons , then you 'll know that an encounter can often take more than an hour . Not so here.The rules have been laid out to make encounters very brief . And you wo n't feel cheated . All of the rolls are with 20-sided dice . Damage is 1 , 2 or 3 hit points . Almost everything has between 1-12 hit points . So creature die fast.Each player adds more of a challenge . So if you solo , it 's just as hard as with 5 people ( more or less -- I think it 's just a tad harder with more people ) . So as you add more people , their ability to play their role becomes crucial ( fighters fight , clerics heal , wizards blast from afar , etc ) .The rules roughly follow the 4.0 version of the Dungeons and Dragons rules . You have daily , utility and at-will powers . Swinging a sword is at-will , blasting something with a powerful fireball is daily.You collect experience as you kill creatures . If you kill something with a roll of 20 and you have 5 experience points in monsters , then you can level up your character to gain more hit points , less chance of being hit and more powers.Quests are found in a quest book that tells you how to set up the game and who the boss is . The end of most quests have a boss that will take a lot to kill.Durability -- -- -- -- -- The game is very well made . The plastic is hard enough to not break after thorough use . The cardboard pieces are very dense and thick.Our cards warped a little one a humid night , but it was n't horrible.Nerd-Factor -- -- -- -- -- -This game had far less nerdness than regular D & D . ; But it also does n't have some of the fun aspects of role-playing ( like a long , emmersive and interactive storyline ) . You can feel safe to invite people over to play who are not Dungeons & Dragons addicts.Minitaures -- -- -- -- -- All of the pieces are very detailed . Some look identical to the D & D ; 4.0 creatures and characters that are sold for the miniatures game . However , none of these pieces are painted . They are all one solid ( or translucent ) color.Fun Factor -- -- -- -- -- Since the game has no need for a Dungeon Master or someone to play the enemy , everyone can enjoy playing on the same team . And you 'll rarely have mathematical discussions of how to absolutely maximize every turn in order to survive ( a common occurance in many other dungeon crawls , e.g . Descent : Journey into the Darkness ) .So , overall , it 's just a good time with a bunch of friends . Win or lose , you 'll enjoy the comraderie of tearing through baddies and collecting treasure.Replayability -- -- -- -- -- -- -The game offers tons of quests and there 's practically in infinite number more online . You could also just make up your own quests . The randomization of encounter and treasure cards keeps things changing . And you can add more heroes , treasure cards , encounter cards and quests by purchasing Ravenloft or the coming Legends of Drizzt board game.Overall -- -- -- -This is the best dungeon crawl game I 've ever played . I find it difficult to imagine something working out better.Admittedly , I enjoyed this game even more when I played with the cards from Ravenloft added into it . Some of the skills in this game do n't synergize very well together , but they do with the Ravenloft game . I have a feeling that Wizards of the Coast did that on purpose .	1
I have loved all the D & D board games from Wizards of the Coast so far ( I have the other two already ) and this one was no exception . Great pieces and sturdy construction make for a lot of fun . I especially liked the more challenging Encounter cards in this game in particular . Very fun and relatively easy to learn . There is a bit of reading but once you get though that it is very simple and once you & # 34 ; get it & # 34 ; you do n't need to really re-read the instructions . Maybe we went back for clarification once or twice in the first few games , but that was it . If you loved old school D & D but wished it was a bit more tactile ( you know , game pieces and stuff ) as opposed to all pencil and paper & # 34 ; in your head & # 34 ; like I did , then you will LOVE this !	1
I own this and Castle Ravenloft , which are the two I would always put together . WoA is what most recommend as the one to get if you just get one -- it 's difficulty is average ( unlike CR which is cruel ) and the heroes are good . These D & D ; games are so much fun because it truly is a & # 34 ; system & # 34 ; of sorts . You will end up having a ton of little figurines ( sadly not painted the way some other games have them , but then again you get so many of it it only makes sense ! ) , a bajillion little tokens , and an amazingly well illustrated rulebook , along with a really good collection of scenarios to play ( a lot of 'em ! ) .This game , when you have the 1-2.5hrs needed for some of the scenarios with friends , just plays so well with the whole group . It 's truly cooperative , every character is different and everyone can contribute into the fun.I do suggest that if you buy this game , play it for a bit w/ the base rules , and if you ever start feeling like you are finding it & # 34 ; a bit mechanically repetitive & # 34 ; then pause , go to boardgamegeek and find the variants ( one I published in fact ) that allow for an & # 34 ; Initiative & # 34 ; system - it will change everything and you 'll be back to enjoy this game in no time ! Absolutely worth every penny when it is ~ $ 40 .	1
Ideally , it 's a 5 stars D & D ; board game as the pervious one Dungeons & Dragons : Castle Ravenloft Board Game for most first time D & D ; board game players.The way to play is just like Dungeons & Dragons : Castle Ravenloft Board Game , but it added some more new features such as GP for purchase items , NPC status , and chamber cards for quests.I like it , but I do have some disappointments as an old player for D & D ; board game.1 . Monster level is still up to level 6 , and character level is only up to level 2 , so it 's a still short game as before . There is no exciting part on the leveling point of view . If they can make monster level up to 8 or more , and provide charcater cards for both current and pervious version heros , and all heros levels are up to level 3 . It will have more fun and make a this advanture to combine with pervious one even better.2 . Monsters ... Top two monsters are the same as before like a big dragon plus a key monster . Little monsters quantity is only up to 3 as maximum . So , the formula is totally the same as pervious one . It did n't proivde new exciting challenge to me . I was hope this advanture having some different scenarios such as my hero to be surranded by more a big group of orc , goblin , or what else evil monsters on my way searching the secrect of wrath of ashardalon , but the maximum is 3 ... ... After we received it and play 5 hours ... I have to say ... It 's a good game , and it should have 5 stars as Castle Ravenloft ; however , it does n't include enough features as a 2nd D & D ; board game for players who played Castle Ravenloft and look for more . It 's a game with almost the same formula like pervious one via adding few new features , but not that exciting . It does n't provide a good way to combine both D & D ; board games together making more fun for old players , so I would like to give it 4 stars instead of 5 .	1
This is in my opinion the best dungeon crawler out there . It can be setup , played and tore down all in under 2 hours . It makes a fun ride , and is fun with your kids too ( mine are 5 and 7 ) .	1
I have n't played any type of Dungeons and Dragons games since I was a boy . With work and family duties it would be hard to find the time to play in a real D & D ; group , so I decide to do the next best thing and pick up this cooperative D & D ; board game , so I can play myself or with my family . First off this is not close to the book version of D & D ; that I used to play years ago , it 's a simplify board game version , your character can only level up to two , and go on short adventures.The board game has many cards , tokens , figures and tiles . So if you have small children you may want them somewhere else when playing because little hands likegetting into stuff . You get an easy to follow user hand book and an adventure book.Gameplay can take over an hour plus , it all depends on how many players you have and what adventure you are playing . This is pretty much a pure dungeon crawler so if you looking for something else like a storyline or true roleplaying this is n't the game for you . Many part of this dungeon crawler is random , like placing down the tiles and picking monster to fight , so difficulty depends on luck of the draw than anything else . Combat is very easy , just role a 20 sided dice and add any hit modifier to your role to hit , if the total is higher than the monster AC then you hit . You should be able to learn the rule after the first adventure . If you never played D & D ; games , this is a great place to start.I would recommend around 3-4 players .	1
With this set , I now own all three D & D ; adventure system products , ( WOA , Castle Ravenloft , Legend of Drizzt ) as well as two Dungeon Command sets . I first bought Legend of Drizzt ( easiest of the three ) and found it to be a superb dungeon romp . Castle Ravenloft is brutal , a meatgrinder . WOA takes the middle ground , for the most part . There are times where something leads to multiple monsters spawning at one time . If you are playing two-player or solo , this will wear you down . One scenario calls for you to take out 12 monsters . Sounds simple , right ? It would be simple , except that Ashardalon 's card is in that deck , too . EVERY time we play this scenario , Ashardalon 's card shows up late in the game , usually when the healing surges are already used up . Still , this game is quite a bit easier than Castle Ravenloft , tougher than Legend of Drizzt.AS with all of these Adventure series boardgames , the miniatures are the cheapest RPG miniatures you will find . The dungeon floor tiles are nice and can also be used to generate random dungeons for tabletop AD & D . ; Also , the Dungeon Command game sets can be integrated into these adventure series games . Simply take the cards provided , shuffle them into your game monster deck . BAM ! New monsters to torment you . ( With painted miniatures ) I take Two different Dungeon Command card sets , shuffle one of them into these games to add an extra flavor to the game . For example , shuffle Blood of Gruumsh into WOA to fight a lot of Orcs and their homies . The game will have a decidedly Orc-centric flavor . Shuffle Tyranny of Goblins into Legend of Drizzt , for a strong goblin aroma.Buy any or all of these Adventure System games , they are simple , fast-playing , co-op ( mostly ) and above all , FUN !	1
Well , this is an awesome D & D dungeon crawling board game . I think being that it 's D & D says enough . This was designed well and plays well . One of the best dungeon crawler board games out there along with Descent 2.0 and Castle Ravenloft , Wrath of Ashardalon . The components are top notch and the hero variety is good .	1
I was lucky enough to snag this off Amazon for $ 37.Just getting back into D & D . ; Only playing 1st edition this was a big change . It took a few rounds but it was very easy to catch on to the game play . It was nice that a DM is not needed . Every one gets to play . The game comes with a 10 good scenarios that can be played out in about 2 hours . Some were so good we played them again and just switched up characters . The game comes with a nice selection of miniatures . You get your money back on those alone . The map system is interlocking squares that you put together at random . So every time you play its a new map . Also great for building your own maps.My only negative about this is some characters just seem a bit over powered . With some of the treasure items there is only a 1 in 10 chance of missing your target.After playing this I kept my eyes out for Wrath of Ashardalon , and Castle Ravenloft . I have played some Wrath and wished I had started with that one first . All 3 can be mixed together if you choose . I plan to use them in future regular D & D ; adventures and cant wait to make some of my own custom maps using the peaces that came with them .	1
BASIC DESCRIPTION -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -This is the 3rd version of the Dungeons and Dragons games . The other two are here : Dungeons and Dragons : Castle Ravenloft Board GameWrath of Ashardalon : A D & D ; BoardgameIf you 've played any of those games , skip past this part and go right to THE GOOD.It plays the same and the parts are all interchangeable.The basic game is played similar to Dungeons and Dragons 4th edition . You move a character , you attack baddies using class-specific skills and you finish a map by getting a unique item or killing a certain creature.The rules make for a fun , quick game . After just two or three hours , you 'll have finished a dungeon . This is awesome for players who do n't have the time to invest into full-on roleplaying.You can play this game by yourself or with up to 5 people . The more the merrier . You can play by yourself because the enemies all have their artificial intelligence listed on a card . For instance , you might get a card that says something like : If this creature is more than 2 tiles away , it moves 2 tiles closerIf this creature is 2 tiles away or less , it shoots with an Attack +5 , 1 damageIf this creature is adjacent to a hero , it uses a dagger with an Attack +2 , 1 damageAttacks are rolled with a 20-sided die ( the only die needed for the game -- it is included ) . If the 20-sided-die roll + the Attack > = the hero 's AC , then it 's a hit . So you 'd want to engage the creature adjacent to it so that it will have a low chance of hitting your character.If you kill a creature , you gain a treasure and experience . If you ever roll a 20 , you can trade experience to level up your character ( can only be done once ) . A leveled up character has better stats and can have more skills.Now onto the good parts and bad parts of this game : THE GOOD -- -- -- -- The figures are the best yet . You get a bunch of goblins and undead along with some awesome trolls , a dragon and a massiveBalor . They are not painted like the expensive miniatures , but you could paint them yourself if you wanted . They are very durable and extremely well-detailed.Also , the quests in this edition are better than the others . They feel more personal . You get to know the characters better ( they are R.A. Salvatore 's already well-establish characters ( note : I have not read his Drizzt stuff yet , so you still get to know the characters even if you have n't read his work ) ) . The game feels more connected and less `` go here , kill this guy , move on . `` THE LESS GOOD -- -- -- -- -- -- -The previous 2 games had more solid cards . They were indisputably clear . Not so in this edition.During the 2nd or 3rd quest , we ran into a boss character 's AI that was not clear . It said something similar to : `` If he is adjacent to only 1 hero , he attacks with a vampiric dagger . If he is more than 1 tile away , he approaches and attacks with a sword . If he is 2 tiles or more away , he moves 2 tiles closer . `` What was n't clear was what he would do if he was adjacent to more than 1 hero . He is n't more than 1 tile away , but he has more than 1 hero adjacent to him . Does he use the sword ? Does he use the dagger ? Is he scared and does n't do anything ? ( that 's what the goblin archers do -- it 's not a ridiculous thought ) The next quest we did , we had to kill a dragon . The dragon 's AI did some weird things . You had to be on his tile to attack him . But there were areas where you could be adjacent to the dragon , the dragon could n't go by you and you could n't attack the dragon.As far as we could tell , the card did n't list if the dragon could fly over characters ( we assumed it could ) . It did n't list what the dragon would do if there was no place for it to land ( would it toss the characters aside so that it had room ? -- we assumed it would ) .It 's not a major problem because everyong playing the game can just decide how to fill in the gaps . But it was somewhat annoying considering how perfect the AI was in the previous two games.OVERALL -- -- -- -If you like dungeon hack-n-slash style of board games but do n't want to invest the time that mammoth games likeDescent Journeys in the Darkrequire , then this is where you need to go.These are my favorite hack-n-slash board games I 've ever played .	1
I played for the first time with my husband last night , and it was simple enough to pick up and learn ( we did n't do the advanced play ) We fudged some of the rules just because we forgot about some of the steps , but we beat the game and had a great time together.We 've never played any D & D ; besides Three Dragon Ante and the video games , but my husband has read some of the books.I liked the character choices and the enemies were interetesting . It was challenging but not so much that we did n't want to keep playing .	1
This game improves upon its predecessors ( Ravenloft and Ashardalon games ) by adding the stance mechanic , competitive cooperative team or player vs player scenarios . It does remove the campaign mode but there is plenty of official and unofficial content online as well as the ability to create your own adventure.Those familiar with the Drizzt books will recognize some of the scenario stories in the game but it is not necessary to know the story to enjoy this game . Definitely recommend if you enjoyed the previous games or just want to try the D & D ; board games for the first time . There is a mix of luck ( random card draws , tile draws , and dice rolls ) but there is also a bit of tactical and teamwork play to help balance it out as well .	1
I brought this for a christmas gift . My grandson and son love playing board games so I am hoping they will like this one as well .	1
This game is just as much fun as the Ravenloft version . The board ( s ) , game pieces , and cards are all very well made . One of the things I enjoy most about these D & D ; board games is that they are co-operative . No more feeling like I have to let my son win or give him an edge . We win or we lose TOGETHER . I also love the replay aspect of this game . No two games are ever alike because you can never have the exact same game board . Genius ! So , if you are looking for a co-op game with high durability and a lot of replay value , look no further than these board games from WotC . Great products !	1
This game is so fun . Being a guy that used play D & D ; back in the day but does n't have the time to play a game that lasts 3+ hours , this is the perfect alternative . You can play with up to five friends or play alone controlling two characters since the monsters are controlled by cards that determine the attacks.It always is unpredictable due to the innovative random tile sets . You can also easily design your own adventures as well.Tons of replay , always action based , not to complex to learn and lots of fun !	1
The content you get in the game is immense . Many D & D players may choose to buy the games just for the miniatures . The game is a lot of fun and can be interchanged with the previous versions . While it can be played solo its more fun to play with friends .	1
If you have never played a trading card game or dungeons and dragon card game , this might SEEM to be little intimidating but its actually really simple to understand.Infact its lot simpler than real trading card games like magic the gathering which has so many different spells and abilities it can be confusing what each one really does.First thing you want to do if your new to this type of games is to check out all the pieces , all the cards , the cavern/dungeon tiles . This will help you get an idea.Then read the instruction booklet over and over till you understand it and you will . it may take a few days but you will.The cards dont have the great art that magic the gathering has but in exchange for that you get these amazingly detailed and awesome figures which is so satisfying to see it there on the board attacking you . You do n't get to see that with traditional trading card games where there is no figures .	1
I love playing this with my brother . I can also play it by myself if the mood strikes , but normally I just play with him . The rules are pretty straightforward once you get the hang of it , and if you need a little guidance , there are lots of answers online .	1
Great game , though it is a bit on the easy side compared to Ashardalon and Ravenloft . The lack of a healer archetype is a bit of a let down , but characters are interesting otherwise .	1
Fantastic game , if nothing else than for the miniatures contained within that you can not get anywhere else ( Jarlaxle , Cattie-Brie , Regis , etc. ) . Great game to play with friends	1
When Heroscape came out from Wizards of the Coast I was livid . It was a board game that had fantasy elements and yet nothing in common with Dungeons & Dragons , and yet the Open Game License had been adopted by publishers everywhere to spread the D & D ; brand far and wide . It was like Hasbro thought the D & D ; license was good enough for everybody else but their own games . That all changed with 4th Edition . The Legend of Drizzt is the culmination of a synchronized brand strategy that 's been decades in the making.Long before Drizzt Do'Urden was a duel-wielding archetype envied by every power gamer , I read his originating tale in the Icewind Dale trilogy - along with Bruenor Battlehamer , Catti-brie , and Wulfgar . That was twenty years ago . Now the guy who was originally conceived as a sidekick for Wulfgar has his own board game , The Legend of Drizzt . Drizzt , you 've come a long way baby.The first thing you notice about The Legend of Drizzt is the sheer size of the thing . The box is heavy and for good reason - it includes over 40 plastic figures , 13 heavy cardstock sheets of tiles and a bazillion cardboard accessories , 200 encounter and treasure cards , a rule book , a scenario book , and a 20-sided die.Let 's start with the plastic figures . They 're unpainted but molded in a variety of colors that match their appearance - water elementals and ghosts are in blue transparent plastic , trolls and goblins are in green , heroes are in dark blue , villains in gray , drow elves in purple ... you get the idea . Speaking of villains , Drizzt 's archenemy Artemis Entreri is here too in case you 're interested in playing an antihero . Up to five players select a placard representing their character that includes critical stats ( HP , AC , Speed ) along with power cards for that character 's class . There are at-will powers and encounter powers . Fans of 4th Edition Dungeons & Dragons will recognize how much the tabletop role-playing game has in common with the board game . Critics of 4th Edition Dungeons & Dragons will notice how easy it is to turn the tabletop role-playing game into a board game.This is n't really so much a game about Drizzt as it is a modular system that can accommodate any setting . Change the tiles around , switch out the characters and molded pieces , and the same game could easily take place in Castle Ravenloft or in a dragon 's lair , which is why the game is compatible with Castle Ravenloft and Wrath of Ashardalon . You could just as easily use the components to complement your own role-playing game.And that 's the brilliance of The Legend of Drizzt . It takes the elements and branding of the role-playing game and takes it to its logical conclusion as a board game . The Legend of Drizzt is filled with dozens of fiddly bits , from stances to damage counters to healing surges to treasure chests . You can even level up from first- to second-level , which officially makes this the real `` Basic Set '' for converting gamers to the role-playing hobby .	1
Lite , as in rules , not content . This box is crammed with content . The tiles , the minis , the cards . The components alone are well worth the cash . I 'd tried to get my wife into tabletop D & D ; , critical failure . She had ZERO interest . I was pretty sure she would hate this game . SURPRISE ! We played last night and she LOVED it ! This is NOT role playing . This is a STRATEGY game , with some RPG elements . Random nature of the game means no two sessions will be the same . The tiles and minis create a strong visual experience . This game is not easy . We barely got out of our first game session alive . Think of this as a dungeon crawling video game ( Think Wizardry , etc ) in physical format , on your tabletop . The minis are well-sculpted and impressive looking . ( Especially the big red guy ) Rules are simple , there is a beginner and advanced game . VERY pleased , well worth the $ $ $ . NOTE : DO NOT think you will open box and start playing immediately . The dungeon tiles and counters took nearly an hour to punch out and sort . Yes , there is THAT much contentWell played , WOTC !	1
I bought this for my nephew last year . He had met R.A. Salvatore at a book signing . This game has many cool pieces and a great theme . These boxed board games are much more fun than paper and pencil RPG 's because of the wonderful visual aspect of the board and pieces . The Legend of Drizzt Board Game is a great , fun game . My nephew likes it a lot !	1
I 'm fairly new to Euro Gaming and have only played one other D & D board game that was a non cooperative game . It was fun . This game was so much more fun because we were all working together . It was hard . We barely completed the quest . My character had to be healed , another two barely had any hit points left and one was down when I got the crown . A few more turns and we would have lost . That was the easiest one . I do admit we made a few mistakes . I played the solo a few times and either did n't make it or barely made it . This is definitely a challenging game . The game itself is very well made and durable . This is definitely a five star game .	1
If you have Castle Raven loft and the Wrath of Ashardalon , The legend of drizzt has stream lined encounters and added long lasting Powers . If you do n't have either of the first two then this is a must have . The difficulty is hard as Castle Ravenloft .	1
The box design for this game is absolutely the best of any game I have played , ever . Every piece fits in a location , everything fits perfectly and once it is all packed up you can NOT make a mess , even if you try .	1
I 've heard great things about this board game from other people who have played it , and so I decided to pick it up for myself as a birthday present ( using a gift card that was actually a gift , so technically it was a birthday gift from a friend ! ) .I played a 3-player game , which worked out nicely . The game has 8 total turns with each player getting a number of distinct actions within each turn , which are tracked through `` agent '' tokens . If you are playing a 2-player match , each player would start with 4 agent actions per turn , and if you have the maximum recommended 5 players , there would only be 2 agent actions per turn . The 3-player version , players start with 3 agent actions . Once the fifth turn is reached , all players are given an additional agent , making the later turns a little more important than earlier turns . This is a nice way of having games with more players be a little less burdensome than it would be otherwise . There are also two additional `` agents '' ( with associated extra actions for the player that controls them ) which can become available during later rounds.The basic concept of the game is that each of the players represents the `` sponsor '' for adventurers ( wizards , thieves , fighters , clerics ) in a D & D ; world . Scoring consists of `` victory points '' , which may be earned in various ways , but are mostly earned by having sponsored adventurers complete `` quests '' . To complete a quest , each quest will have a specific number of each type of adventurer that need to be recruited , and perhaps gold to be supplied . Once completed , quest rewards ( adventurers , gold , and/or victory points ) will be earned . Players recruit the adventurers or earn the gold by having their agents visit various buildings within the city . There are also `` intrigue '' cards which can be played against other players to interfere with their progress in getting quests completed.There are no dice rolled in this game , so it really is a `` resource '' game with shuffled cards providing the randomness to make the game different with each play . Even though this is set in the Dungeons and Dragons universe , and having some experience with D & D ; makes it easier to grasp some of the concepts , past experience playing D & D ; is certainly not a requirement for enjoying this board game . For me , given that I do n't have as much free time as I used to when I was younger , it is nice to not have to take hours `` prepping characters '' before jumping into a fun game set in the D & D ; universe.This game could certainly take a long period of time if everyone plays slowly and deliberately , but fast paced game play is very much a possibility , potentially allowing for multiple play-throughs on game night . The rules seem simple enough that one play through will be more than enough for people to understand almost all of the nuances to the game without too much trouble . So , while new players might be at a disadvantage in not knowing exactly what to do in the first turn or two , after a while keeping up with experienced players should n't be too much of a problem.Overall , this is a very well balanced board game , with plenty of player interaction , and only a marginal level of `` cut throat '' actions harming other players . While there is some potential for a player in the lead running away with the game , but due to some interesting design elements ( hidden `` victory points '' that are counted at the end of the game ; `` manditory quests '' that can be forced on other players , the ability to see what resources other players need to gain victory points ) that is less of a problem than I have seen in other board games.I would rate this as a `` moderately serious '' board game with a high degree of re-playability . I do n't think I would enjoy a 2-player session quite as much as a 3 , 4 or 5-player session .	1
Despite being a dungeons and dragons game this is not a pen and paper role playing game or any game of that sorts . This is what was stopping my gaming group from trying it ( they arent big fans of D & D ; like I am ) . This is a worker placement type game . You have your agents which you have to place on certain locations to gather the resources needed to complete a task ( quest ) . The resources in this game are wizards , warriors etc in the form of coloured cubes which can be easily though of like wood , stone etc . Once you have the necessary resources to complete a quest , you trade them in for the completed quest to get the points required to win the game . It has intrigue cards which will allow you to mess with other players , there are buildings you can build which will produce & # 34 ; resources & # 34 ; and as & # 34 ; owner & # 34 ; of the building you will get a benefit whenever someone uses it . It is pretty straight forward and easy to learn and teach . Do not get put off by the fact that is D & D ; themed if you do not like D & D ; as this is only the theme of it . It plays just like any worker placement / resource gathering game.I enjoyed it and many members of the group were surprised they liked it as they started off thinking they wont because it was a D & D ; game.To see how it is played you can search on youtube for the tabletop episode with Wil Wheaton playing it . You will know if this game is for you once you have seen it there .	1
It 's a great strategy game . The more players , the more chaotic and fun as you fight for resources and opportunities .	1
Very much enjoy this game as there is a lot going on . It 's intelligent , well thought out , and a lot of fun to play .	1
Lords of Waterdeep is a fantastic light worker placement game , and along withStone Age Board Game , the perfect gateway game for non-gamers . Experienced gamers will likely also love it . It is so elegantly designed , so easy to teach and remember , yet difficult to master , that it is a classic of its kind , right up there with other great gateway games likeTicket To Ride , Guillotine , Stone Age , andDominion . The quality of the components is excellent with ( mostly ) nice art throughout . The board is easy to understand and only rarely runs out of room for new buildings ( 10 slots are provided , but there is room in the center of the board to fit a few more in ) . Sure , the D & D ; theme feels slightly pasted on , but the mechanics are sound and it 's a hell of a lot of fun , with excellent replay value.At the beginning of the game , each player gets dealt a secret Lord card , representing which of the secret lords of the city they are playing . Each lord prefers two different types of quests and gives a 4 point end-game victory point bonus for completing quests of those types ( no two lords prefer both the same quests , though many overlap with one ) . There is one exception , a lord who gives no quest bonus , but instead a 6 point bonus for each building you control at the end . This lord is harder to win with in games with more than 2 players , but in my experience , can be almost impossible to beat it in a 2-player game . You also get dealt two random quest and intrigue cards , which I 'll explain below . Intrigue cards are kept secret until played , but quest cards are public knowledge and kept face-up until completed.You get a number of meeples ( `` your lord 's agents '' ) who are placed one at a time in turn order until everyone has assigned all theirs . On the 5th round , everyone gets a bonus meeple . Most places , only one person can get the space 's offering that turn . Two of the spaces allow up to three meeples to be assigned ( including multiple of the same player 's meeples ) . These are for gaining new quests or playing intrigue cards . Intrigue cards let you get a bonus , or mess with another player , or give everyone a bonus ( but the person who played the card gets the best ) . The Builder 's Hall space lets you choose from three different buildings to buy . Buildings offer cubes or money or intrigue cards beyond and better than the spaces on the board . They cost 4-8 money each . When you buy one , it is instantly available for use by all players . Whoever assigns their meple to the building space gets its offerings , but the owner of the building gets a reward too , which is usually a lesser version of the building 's offering , but some offer in-game victory points . So you want to buy buildings and hope other players use them . If you use your own building , you do n't get the owner reward , just whatever anyone would get for using it . All the other spaces give money or one or two of a specific color cube ( `` adventurer for hire '' ) .You usually score in-game victory points by completing quests , of which there are five types : Warfare , Piety , Skullduggery , Commerce , and Arcana . Each requires a variety of colored cubes and/or money to complete , and the type of quest determines the bulk of the cubes and/or money it requires . White cubes are clerics ( Piety ) , Purple cubes are wizards ( Arcana ) , black cubes are thieves ( Skullduggery ) , and orange cubes are fighters ( warfare ) . Commerce quests all require money to complete in addition to a mix of cubes . Some quests offer an ongoing bonus power but are worth less ( these are called Plot Quests and clearly marked on the quest card ) . However , most just give you an immediate victory point bonus and/or some other cool thing , such as bonus cubes or money . One even gives you an extra , special colored meeple , but is worth no points and is a pain to complete . Get it early enough , and you can have a huge advantage . Get it or complete it late and not only will it not be of much help , but will likely cost you the game if you waste resources on it that could be better spent collecting other quests that hand out victory points.The game lasts eight rounds . Each round , all the spaces you can place your meeples on refresh with whatever goods they are offering ( money , buildings , intrigue cards , etc. ) . There is also a space for getting the first player token . There are always four face-up quests available , but if you do n't want any of those , you can choose to discard them all in favor of four new ones , but then you 're stuck with keeping one of whatever new ones come out . There is no penalty for uncompleted quests at the end of the game.My only real complaint is with the box itself . The way it is designed is arty-farty with a dumb extra `` fake '' bottom that ca n't be removed and exists just to look cool , so do n't put any weight on it , as that bends/crushes the box easily , which is not acceptable , especially for a game that costs this much . And , due to the stupid design of the bottom , you ca n't put the top lid over it . It wo n't fit . The plastic insert tray holds everything separate and mostly snug ( but way too snug in the case of the money and jewel tokens which are an absolute nightmare to put back in ) . As seemingly snug as things may appear , however , I would n't go turning the box upside-down if I were you . Also , after owning the game for a month , the inside bottom part of the box is split on two corners ! Do you know how many game boxes have done that to me ? Zero , at least in the time frame I 'm talking about here . Normally , it takes years , possibly decades , for a box to fall apart , but not this one . In my opinion , this is the worst-designed game box in board game history , and the plastic insert tray is no prize , either . All the other components ( cubes , cards , meeples , etc . ) are solid and durable , however.The newLords of Waterdeep Expansion : Scoundrels of Skullport ( D & D ; Boxed Game ) is due out August 20 , 2013 , and the rules are available to preview now as a free PDF on the Wizards of the Coast site . This double expansion contains two new add-on maps ( one for the evil underground town of Skullport , one for the infamous dungeon of Undermountain ) . There are a ton of new buildings , new quests , new intrigue cards , six new Lords ( including the beholder crime lord , Xanathar ) , a new resource called Corruption ( and an associated Corruption Track board ) , as well as optional rules , important rules clarifications and errata for the base game , and a set of gray meeples to add a sixth player . It also includes an extra meeple in each of the original player colors for longer games , which are mandatory when adding a sixth player and optional otherwise . So a two-player game would have you begin with five meeples , then add a sixth one on round five . This expansion -- the first of what will hopefully be many -- adds a ton of replayability and new ways to strategize and win . After reading the rules , it looks like a must-own.Note that a guy in Canada is selling custom , laser-cut , painted `` DnDeeples '' ( search for them using that term ) . For hardcore lovers of Lords , these can replace the cubes with meeple-looking clerics holding maces , dual-dagger wielding thieves , wizards with staff and pointy hat , and viking helmeted fighters with a sword ! A gaming buddy of mine bought 'em and loves 'em . I 'll admit they 're very cool , but a totally extravagant expense .	1
This game is made by the Dungeons and Dragons company , do n't let that scare you away . It is not like D & D at all , I have never actually been apart of any D & D roleplaying , but this game is solidly a Euro game . That means that each turn you are going to be placing a worker/agent out on the board to gain you resources or missions or buildings that can get you more gold , victory points , or workers . You have to find the most efficient way to transform your workers/gold into victory points and then the player with the most VP at the end of the game wins . That is basically the entire game . It looks nerdy and sounds nerdy , but it is really fun and the entire family would really enjoy it if they looked past the fantasy theme and saw that the gameplay is actually really fun ! I would recommend this game to many people , mostly gamers , but that is because I know the theme would turn off many non-gamers . If you love euro games or you love worker-placement games , this is an awesome game for you . I will keep it on my shelve forever .	1
I picked this up as a Christmas gift for a friend . The game is fantastic ! It is THE game everyone wants to play when we get together . He even picked up the Skullport expansion for it and have had a blast . The game can be somewhat complicated at first , but once you have a chance to play a few rounds , it opens up into a very nice strategy game .	1
Amazingly fun game . Wotc products can be hit or miss sometimes with me and buddies but this hit the nail on the head for fun . Ca n't wait for . Expansions .	1
Game strikes right balance between simplicity for ease of learning and complexity for replayability . A very enjoyable game to play .	1
I 'm not going to go into all of the mechanics of & # 34 ; Lords of Waterdeep. & # 34 ; Instead , I will just tell you that I was never a fan of worker placement games until I played it . Now , because of & # 34 ; Lords of Waterdeep. & # 34 ; they are among my favorite kinds of game . & # 34 ; Lords of Waterdeep & # 34 ; is a great production that boasts a beautiful board and artwork , and top-notch wooden components . Every game that I have played has been fairly close , leading to some really tense game play . I 've yet to play with someone who did n't get sucked into this game with its easy to learn mechanics and thrilling fun . When one thinks of D & D , the first thing that pops into the average head is a dungeon crawl . It 's amazing that the designers made such wonderful game , set in such a distinctive universe , that is not about a dungeon crawl . Instead , & # 34 ; Lords of Waterdeep & # 34 ; offers something new and fun , that will no doubt capture the imagination of many for years to come .	1
Lords of Waterdeep : 2-5 Players , Ages 12+ , Average Play Time = 45-60 MinutesI have to say , the components are top-notch . Everything from the pieces , to the art , to the plastic tray insert is fantastic . I ca n't stress this enough . Even the manual is excellent as it includes appendices for all of the buildings , lord cards , and etc while also including a picture of how the pieces fit into the game 's plastic insert . I 'd give a thumbs up to this game just for this particular aspect alone.This game is fairly simple to learn and play . The most complex part , at least in my opinion , was getting used to all of the options you may have at any one time . There are many buildings that do various things ... it 's often that you may need to pause to figure out how you want to go about getting the resources you need while preventing your opponent from getting the resources they may need . Sure , you could assign an agent to your opponent 's shop to get that fighter and wizard you need ... but as a reward for you shopping there , your opponent may get the fighter they need to complete a quest.I really like the addition of the lord cards as they allow players to specialize in certain areas . For example , my son had the lord card that provided him with a bonus for every building he built by game 's end . I , of course , did n't know that , though I noticed him purchasing buildings like mad throughout the game . I chalked it up to him just liking the feeling of owning a building ... I wo n't make that mistake again . I was winning , but he pulled ahead and won by a hair because of all the bonus points he accumulated at the end of the game.My son 's favorite part of the game was completing quests ... he enjoyed figuring out what he needed and where to go to get them . The scores were close all the way through so neither of us felt like we were beaten before the game came to its conclusion . My favorite part was purchasing buildings ... rewarding the owner of the building with resources or points is an excellent game mechanic in my opinion.If you 're a fan of worker placement games , then I highly recommend Lords of Waterdeep .	1
LoW is probably the most complicated `` euro-style '' game I 've ever played , but it 's also one of the most fun , and one of the most replayable . The setup of the game takes around 10 minutes alone . Play takes roughly an hour , give or take a little depending on the familiarity of the players.I wo n't go into how to play , as it 's a fairly complicated game . Suffice to say that you have only a handful of actions per turn , but copious amounts of choices to make per turn . Do I try to acquire adventurers so I can complete quests ? Do I play Intrigue cards to derail my opponents ? Do I try to claim the First Player marker so that I go first next round ? Do I build a building and hope to cash in on other players using it ? Do I claim more quests ? Lots and lots of choices , but limited resources to execute them.Strategy in the game revolves around doing quests . Your `` Lord '' ( randomly chosen at the start of the game ) determines which types of quests give you bonus points at the end of the game . However , because the quests available are randomly determined as the game progresses , it 's often difficult to capitalize on this bonus . Since the quests vary greatly in the resources required to complete them , you end up spending your turns debating whether to acquire resources , play ( or gather ) Intrigue cards to either hinder your opponents or gain resources yourself , or set up plays for future turns . Generally , the more resources a quest requires , the bigger the payout . Though the big reward quests are tempting , it 's often better to complete multiple smaller quests of your lord 's speciality to acquire the bonus points . You also have to plan ahead to ensure that you 're not found wanting a specific adventurerer type or gold in order to complete a quest.I still have n't completely identified a routinely successful strategy to playing the game , though playing at least one agent into Waterdeep Harbor seems to be effective , if you do n't require much resources for quests . The Harbor allows you to not only play an Intrigue card , but also to redeploy your agent at the end of the round . With good planning , you can play your card AND get the resources that you need . Too many Intrigue cards end up wasting your time , however , as you wo n't gain as many resources from playing them as you will get from buildings on the board . I could go on for pages about various strategies , but ultimately you have to play the game for yourself to determine what works for that particular game.Production quality is very good for the game . All pieces are either ~2mm thick plastic-coated cardboard or wood . The Quest and Intrigue cards are plastic-coated as well , much like good playing cards . Most impressive to me is that the game box contains an insert which neatly stores all of the pieces in various wells dedicated to those pieces . This allows you to quickly distribute materials and set up the game without having to dig around the box and sort all of the little tokens . It also makes the box `` tip-resistant '' , where flipping it upside-down wo n't cause all the pieces to go flying around the box . Granted , some will lose their places , but they 're easily retrieved . My major complaint is with the victory-point tokens and the 1 gold piece markers . They take some doing to get them to fit in their assigned spots in the insert , but I do n't really know how one would improve upon the design to ease the problem.Overall , this is n't a quick or simple game . It requires some time dedicated to setting up and playing it , and requires a fair amount of thinking and strategizing to play well . It is absolutely worth getting and playing though . The replay value of the game is tremendous and the quality of the product will keep it in good playing shape for many games to come .	1
This is an excellent strategy game , and definitely easier to pick up and play than most ive played . learning it is easy and setup and teardown is minimal , making it a good choice for the easily distracted type of player.The only complaint i have is the & # 34 ; intrigue & # 34 ; cards are really quite laughably bad . none of them are good enough to play over basically any other action .	1
D & D has fast become the leading title in role play gaming , this is no exception . Although the gameplay is unlike other D & D branded games , it is still well within the realm of this beloved RPG title . The game plays through 8 rounds as you place your pieces on the board to obtain resources . The resources collected are used to accomplish missions and further the plot of the character selected at the beginning of the game . Points are gained by accomplishing said tasks and the player with the highest tally at the end wins . It is a simple learning curve with plenty of strategy . I highly recommend as an avid gamer and game store owner !	1
Background / IntroductionLords of Waterdeep is a fantastic worker placement game with high quality components and a great fantasy theme . You will notice the Dungeons and Dragons label on the box and in most cases this will either make you very excited about the game or turn you off to it immediately . I for one , have never played Dungeons and Dragons or any other tabletop RPG . I wanted to play this because of all the great things I kept hearing about it and I saw it played on TableTop . Well , all the good things I heard are true and I love this game.Components / Rule BookThis game has a very high quality production value . The first thing you will probably notice is the nice box that the game comes in . The box has a nice finish to it and seems like it will be very durable . It also has a very unique way that the lid and box fit together creating a nice visual effect . Once the box is open , you will notice the amazing plastic insert that will help organize the game components . This insert is probably the best one that I have encountered . Everything has its place and it all fits perfectly . The insert also is designed such that you can very easily retrieve the components from the box without having to tip the thing upside down . Hands down the best use of an insert.Another nice touch to keep the game feeling unique , is the shape and design of the gold used in the game . There are two different types of gold tokens , one is square and the other is a half-moon shape each with a little hole in the middle . I really like this little detail that adds to the theme and just gives another component that stands out above just using a normal round looking coin . The gold tokens are very high quality cardboard type pieces , but they have a nice finish to them and will keep well . Of course , I would have loved actual metal coins , using the cardboard I 'm sure keeps the price point down.The game includes a board and building tiles which are also made of some nice cardboard . I am impressed with the building tile pieces from Lords of Waterdeep , because similar tiles in other games seem more prone to warping or just feel flimsy . These tiles are anything but . The game includes wooden meeples and scoring tokens that are well painted and look nice . The cards used in the game are nice quality and shuffle well.The only thing that I wish was better is the player mats . The mats in my opinion are not a real huge need , but they are nice to have to keep things organized and to keep track of players ' factions . These mats divide your completed quests from uncompleted ones and provides a storage area for Adventure Cubes and resources . I really wish these mats were made out of the same material as the building tiles - that would be awesome , but alas , they are not . The mats seem to be printed on a cardstock type material and they are flimsy . They could easily become bent or ruined . Again , I know that it was probably a price point thing and the mats are not necessarily small like the building tiles - but that is really the only part about the components that I found lacking.The instruction booklet is also great quality in material and content . A durable rule book with lots of illustrations and well understood rules . The rule book also provides a diagram on how to use the insert - pretty sweet ! I think the quality of components and rule book are top notch.GameplayPlayers are trying to obtain the most victory points by completing quests , building buildings , playing intrigue cards , and by trying to get bonus points from meeting a special goal for your specific Lord . Setup is pretty quick and consists of shuffling some cards and gathering adventurer cubes and other components . Each player gets a Lord of Waterdeep card that will provide bonus points for completing specific types of quests or building buildings . Players will also start with some intrigue cards and some quests.Players will place an agent ( one of their meeples ) on one of the open action spaces which will allow them to gain adventurers , gold , build a building , gain or play an intrigue card , and take on more quests . Building buildings will add more action spaces to the board and the owner of the building bets a benefit whenever some other player uses that building . Intrigue cards allow you to snare up your opponent with such things as mandatory quests that are required to be completed before completing any other quests . The game really is simple and easy to teach/learn , but the game offers a lot of strategy . The game is a great length as well lasting about an hour ( the game is played in 8 rounds and the game is adjusted for the different amount of players by adjusting how many agents a player will start with ) .Closing ThoughtsI really have enjoyed Lords of Waterdeep . I am just amazed at the nice quality components and the attention to detail for each right down to the wonderful box insert to keep everything organized . I like the little things that make the game have a unique feel like how the box closes or the shape of the gold coins . The artwork is great and all the gameplay with components create a really great theme that is enjoyable and yet is n't overwhelming to those who may not care for fantasy . Those who do n't enjoy fantasy at all can still really enjoy this game ! It is n't too heavy , so more casual gamers can still enjoy it . The game length is perfect at around 60 minutes . There is variation in the different quest cards , intrigue cards , and building cards used in each game along with the different Lord cards with special bonus point goals . I like the building concept where if you build a building and another player uses that space , you get rewarded . The simplicity of the game combined with the shear fun of completing quests and great strategy depth should make this game shoot to the top of your want list . And with a great player range of 2 to 5 players , this game seems to have it all . It plays really well with 2 players , a lot better than I originally thought it would . I think that there is a lot of replayability and there is also currently one expansion ( that apparently is like two in one ) available to add even more fun . I hope that I can try it soon as well , for Lords of Waterdeep is amazing and that is How Lou Sees It ! A big SHOUT OUT to Wizards of the Coast for making this review possible .	1
I absolutely love this game . There 's a lot of little moving parts but none of them ever get too much to handle . Even for players who were not board gamers , they loved it as well . Great game .	1
At first I considered not getting this game , but after watching plenty of YouTube videos about the gameplay and strategy involved I decided to go for it . This game is super fun and involves a lot of strategy . I 've played it with my family and they enjoy it a lot , especially since it 's concepts are super streamlined and it 's easy to & # 34 ; see & # 34 ; what is going on unlike a lot of other designer board games . The learn curve for this is very short since it 's mainly just placing workers each turn . I enjoy it a lot and I just got a hold of the expansion for it , so I 'm excited to give it a try . Give this game a try if you know you like worker placement .	1
A shorter playing time , , equally fun worker/action placement game.While agricola and others are lots of fun to play . A three hour game is grueling , especially after a day of work.Lords of waterdeep has a lot of the same elements of these types of games , but is easily finished in 90 minutes , or less/Yay !	1
I have played this at a game convention with other adults , and with my 10 year old son . both experiences have been excellent ! I wish the game came with cooler meeple pieces ( they are available for sale for $ 100+ by an independent provider ) , but even with the ( boring ) cubes , the game is super fun ! ! Highly recommend ! ! !	1
Wizards of the coast surprised the industry by releasing a very solid Euro style boardgame with a dungeons and dragons theme . Players take on the role of the hidden power brokers of the city of Waterdeep and use money and people as resources to earn points in this worker placement game . In a cute twist , the people are represented by little wooden cubes of four colors to signify fighters , clerics , wizards , and rogues . Players spend their resources to satisfy quest which grant points and sometimes other special abilities . The game has a nice story arc as players game more workers to place and more locations in which to place them as the game progresses . The game 's only real down side is the annoying half sized box lid which keeps falling off . Suitable for ages eight and up , this is probably on the lighter side of family strategy . ( From [ ... ] 's Unplugged Holiday Guide ) [ ... ]	1
You really do n't need to know anything about D & D to play this game . As with all good games , there 's a lot of variety in play decisions and lots of strategies to go for depending on the cards you get . With each person having a hidden 'role ' to give them a potential bonus at the end , it 's hard to tell who is winning . I think the builder role card is a bit too rewarding , but it is what it is . I just hate being the only one going after 'the builder ' to keep them from getting points , because i tend to not be able to adapt a winning strategy for myself . The play is pretty straight-forward and limiting the number of rounds makes you consolidate your moves , though it does tend to lend to over analyzation , so if you have & # 34 ; those & # 34 ; kind of players in your gaming group , you may need to prod them every now and then . Fun to play with variety .	1
There are already over 110 reviews of this game . None of the reviews are less than three stars , so that should already speak volumes about it . I really ca n't think of anything new to add that has n't already been said . I and my game group play this regularly and have n't tired of it .	1
The game is balanced well , and plays great with varying numbers of people . As a Lord of Waterdeep , you have a secret agenda to complete particular mission cards , or collect buildings . You also take and complete missions to gain points , by gathering the required number of adventurers ( colored cubes ) . However gathering the adventurers requires some planning and strategy , because other players will occupy spaces on the board you need to gather those adventurers , and the spaces are usually limited to one person only . You also have to watch out for other players burdening you with cards from their Intrigue deck , where they can give you missions that require your adventurers for small numbers of points , or give them a temporary advantage . Also , since some of the buildings are shuffled in a deck , and purchased by the players , the board changes each time you play it , giving you new opportunities to accomplish your goals .	1
Like other worker replacement games , the challenge lies in there being limited slots where workers can go . If you need to recruit Fighters and another player before you in terms of turn order does that same thing , then you may not get a chance to do so unless you try something else . And you place your workers one at a time - thus it becomes a question of which move is most important - what is your priority and what can you risk someone else taking instead of you ? And so even with so limited moves , the game can be pretty compelling.What helps the game feel distinct are Intrigue cards that can only be played when you put a worker at Waterdeep Harbor . Intrigue cards have some pretty diverse effects including recruiting adventurers or forcing other players to give up some of theirs . Or you can allow an already assigned worker to perform a second job in the same turn . But again there are limited slots at Waterdeep Harbor - and every worker placed there means one you could n't use to draw a new quest or gather more adventurers.The game is brilliantly designed and fairly well-balanced . The random draw of a Lord of Waterdeep that may potentially influence the types of quests you try to take will indeed steer your game play in different ways and helps make each game unique . And even with a mere 8 turns , games with greater numbers of players can last for a fair amount of time and yet will always feel pretty intense . And of course the Forgotten Realms setting adds some nice flavor to the whole experience.Also , the game as one of the best box designs I 've seen in a while - even better than Takenoko . They really thought about ease of storing pieces and ease of deploying them again for a new game . The game board fits snugly into the plastic tray in order to better secure all the loose pieces ( and those are a lot of wooden workers and different colors of blocks representing the different adventurers ) , and I really appreciate the fact that they took the time and effort to design the box in this way.Lords of Waterdeep is a great addition to any game collection and nice twist on the worker-replacement game genre . And yes , you do n't need to know anything about Forgotten Realms or Dungeons and Dragons to enjoy the game , as I 've clearly demonstrated .	1
My wife got me Agricola b/c I told her it was a highly rated resource game . Unfortunately I really hated it b/c we typically only play 2 players and it mostly made me angry due to scarcity of resources . In response I got her Lords of Waterdeep b/c it was lauded as a resource game , but much less complex/easier than Agricola and it 's been an absolute blast to the point my mother in law ( 50+ ) and niece ( 4 ) can follow and play this game with much enjoyment . We 've played it so much the board is starting to come apart ! Note that I am the only one in the family that grew up on D & D ; styled IP . My wife typically hates fantasy and sci-fi type stuff , but she was able to pick this up w/o any problems . She does n't really read the card or pay attention to the art and most wants 'orange guys or purple guys ' as opposed to warriors or mages . Fans of the game will appreciate some quest names like Domesticate Owlbears.Since we 're a casual boardgame family we do n't play with mandatory quests or practice resource denial strategies so it 's more like a resource 'race ' ( like ticket to ride ) so it 's less intense towards the end of the game and easier to have runaway leaders , but due to the lord bonuses and just general randomness of which lord you get , quests , and buildings that are available , it 's maintained it 's replayability for us and since there 's an expansion out , I do n't see this game hitting the cupboard anytime soon.We 've taught this game to multiple friends with varying levels of boardgame experience ( usually little to none or some settlers experience ) and it has always been easy for them to pick up and often they 'll want to play again after we finish.We recommend playing with 3 people as 4 people matches take really long . There are limited rounds , which is good , but adding a fouth person increases the number of turns and agents quite a bit b/c there 's also more competition over spots b/c you can only build a single building per round w/o intrigue cards or special spots .	1
The game has lots of strategy and lots of replay value . I prefer playing it with 2-3 people . More than that and it takes too long between turns .	1
This is a stand-alone game . We 've played it with 2 players , 4 players , and 5 players and it 's been fun with all different size groups . It 's fairly easy to learn and a lot of fun to play .	1
If you are a eurogamer but not particularly drawn to fantasy themed dungeon games , please keep reading this . If you are a dungeon game fanatic with no euro experience , you also should keep reading . This game is a straight euro-style game , with a clever fantasy theme wrapped around it . Mechanically , it runs on worker placement and resource management principles . There are some cool cards , but the game pieces are ... drumroll ... wooden cubes . And some meeples . And some victory point tokens . Eurogamers will rejoice , and dungeon crawl gamers might be surprised . You wo n't find any miniatures here.But this is far from an average euro with cubes . It is actually a very well designed game , with many winning ways to approach it . The object is to complete Quest cards , which each show cube requirements ( called adventurers ) and rewards . Four types of `` adventurers '' are represented by cubes . Orange for fighters , white for clerics , black for rogues , and purple for wizards . Quests cards are colored as well . So an orange Quest ( called a warfare quest ) requires , as its main element , orange cubes . White Quest cards require white cubes , etc . But each will usually require a lesser amount of other resources , such as gold or other colored cubes . Victory points are rewarded for completed quests , and a few other hidden bonus points are awarded at the end.Standard stuff , right ? No.This game works so well because it is fairly quick , and actions are tightly controlled because of limited places on the board to deploy your agents to obtain resources . Think Stone Age , but without as much scoring complication . It 's not exactly the same , but similar . In addition to getting and completing quests , you can obtain and play Intrigue cards , which give you various actions . Other actions you can take include getting gold , and purchasing buildings . Buildings provide more spots for players to place agents , and each building gives that player more resources . Owners of the buildings also get something each time another player uses it.There are elements of several different types of games here , and they all work extremely well together . The fantasy theme provides a nice backdrop , complete with `` flavor text '' on cards and fantasy-type names assigned to buildings and pieces . It all provides extra enjoyment , added to a fine euro-style game . It 's easy to teach and learn , and with one game under your belt you 'll be flying through the next game . And you 'll probably keep coming back , because strategies that work depend on each game and how the other players play . Replay value is high , as far as I can tell from a limited number of games so far . Everyone who has played this with me has enjoyed it , and complaints are few and minor . It 's an excellent game , and one I purchased after just one play , which is quite rare for me . Hope you enjoy it !	1
A D & D ; themed euro game . What more could you want ? : ) Lords of Waterdeep is a worker placement euro game through and through . You will be placing your `` agents '' out in waterdeep to recruit clerics , fighters , wizards and rogues to help you complete quests . Each Lord of Waterdeep has a specific objective for you to complete , like focusing on certain types of quests . You get points by completing quests and bonus points if those quests are of the type requested by your Lord.This game has similar mechanics to Stone Age , Caylus and other worker placement games , but if you like Euro games and D & D ; , this is a great one to pick up . It plays in as little as an hour and even though the box says 12+ my 9 yr old plays it with ease .	1
Conquest of Nerath gets played more than any board game in my house , and I own close to 50 board and card games . It is a D & D ; game certainly , and the D & D ; parts of the game are strikingly true to any of us nerds who love it but it 's also a lot more than that . CoN is a great game for anyone who enjoys strategy , intrigue , a bit of screwing over your friends and a race for glory.The game plays fast in that there are a finite number of rounds in which it is resolved in , it all scales very well with whatever number of players you have at the table and makes for a quick game , depending on how heady you want to get about making your moves.The game centers around amassing people to do quests for you , you move your `` agents '' around the city to acquire clerics , fighters , wizards , and thieves to do your bidding . Cashing them in to complete quests and earn victory points , earn gold , and trying to out maneuver your opponents . There are also intrigue cards which are another core element to turning the tides in your favor and leaving your adversaries high and dry like sticking them with mandatory quests or stealing from their coffers.I ca n't rant and rave enough about how much fun this game is , if you 'd care to learn more I have done a full review and unboxing detailing all that comes in the box over on my blog at ( [ ... ] )	1
Similar to other strategy type games like Agricola and others , it is a fun game with a decent amount of strategy involved . I would definitely recommend for strategy game players particularly if you have a D & D Background ( though that is not required )	1
First time I saw it I did n't expect I will love this game.It is very addictive game but with fairly simple rules . Its a good competition for resources and some minor conflicts between players.Quests with fantasy theme makes this more interesting.The only downside are the cubes . I wished they had actual figures of the characters that the cubes represents . That would be even more believable.UPDATE : I found characters made from wood that can replace the ugly cubes : [ ... ] [ ... ] Excellent news !	1
This game is not overly simple , but simple enough to pick up quickly , or overly complex so game play takes forever to learn . This strikes the right middle space for a game with enough variety and differences to make games different . Very enjoyable game .	1
This is a mass market game that is slightly better than many roll and move mass market games ( you do n't even roll to move ! ) It 's cheap , it has lots of D & D theme , and plays quickly . This is n't going to get play in your gaming group but could be a fun romp with younger kids who can handle the vagrancies of dice-based combat . Yes , this is a remake of the classic from the early 80 's if you 're into nostalgia .	1
I remember playing the original Dungeon ! board game back at my neighbor Kenny 's house . It served as a great recruiting tool for my elementary school friends to get them into playing Dungeons & Dragons later . Over thirty years later , I played this latest iteration with my five-year-old son.The premise of Dungeon ! is the original premise of Dungeons & Dragons : four murder hobos wander into a dungeon , grab as much treasure as they can by killing as many monsters as they can , and then escape back home with it all . The dungeon has a neat order to it , with increasingly difficult levels of monsters ( six in total ) and correspondingly higher treasure rewards . Some treasure includes magic swords that give a bonus to attack while others allow the player to see what monster lurks in the nearby room.Combat with each monster can lead to acquiring a treasure or , if you are unable to beat a target number with a combined roll of two dice , losing treasure , ground , or even your character 's life . But do n't worry , like in the tabletop role-playing game , even death is n't permanent.The original Dungeon ! game had four classes : elf , hero , superhero , and wizard corresponding to the original Chainmail wargame . Yes kids , back then we had heroes and superheroes as classes . The 1980s version I 'm more familiar with was retooled to match Basic Dungeons & Dragons : dwarf , elf , paladin , thief , warrior , and wizard . So perhaps it 's no surprise that this latest version has cleric , fighter , rogue , and wizard classes.The wizard , a constant through all editions , differs significantly from the rest of the classes in his ability to cast spells : fireball , lightning bolt , and teleport . And that 's part of Dungeon ! 's brilliance . You can play correspondingly different levels of play by the character you choose . My son played the Halfling rogue and I played the human fighter . Because each class has different levels of gold requirements to win the game , each class is encouraged to take more or less risk by venturing into deeper levels of the dungeon.One consistent problem with all versions of Dungeon ! is its multitude of pieces . There 's cards for monsters , treasure and spells , cardboard pieces for the classes that do n't stand up particularly well , magic sword tokens , lose a turn tokens , and number tokens that I still have no idea what they do . But the most egregious tokens are the `` cleared '' graveyard markers . When monsters are killed the markers are placed in the room , which is fine , until you have 20+ and if you jostle the board the tokens slide all over the board . It 's very easy to lose track of what rooms you cleared as a result.The other problem is that occasionally you 're supposed to draw cards randomly from your collection of treasure , but they are clearly marked on one side by level and color . The only way to actually randomly select which treasure you lose is by closing your eyes.Still , this is a very entertaining game that can be played by players of different levels of skill . Even a five-year-old . Who beat me at my own game .	1
Dungeon ! is a classic game that I played when I was a boy , it 's very easy to learn and play . My daughter age 8 did n't have any problems learning within a few rounds . The game take around 30-40 mins to finish , and it 's a good introduction to these type of board games for your children . You basically pick a character ranging from a fighter , rogue , mage & cleric , each class has an amount of gold needed to win the game , so the rogue needs 10,000 gold but is fairly weak so it would be hard for him to fight higher level monsters which drop better gold , unlike the mage who needs 30,000 gold to win the game but it better at fighting higher level monsters . You move around the board going into rooms beating the monster to gain gold until you meet the gold requirement then you can leave the dungeon to win . This is a very simple and straight forward game . I would suggest ages 5-12 would love this game .	1
I like this game ; it 's one of the first games we 've bought that 's difficult enough that the adults will be genuinely interested , but easy enough for the kids to play . My 5-year old can ALMOST play it without help.I 've really enjoyed the more difficult , more expensive D & D ; games ( Ravenloft , Drizzt ) . This is vaguely similar - move heroes around and kill monsters - but much simpler . Gameplay summary : take turns moving your hero around the board exploring rooms ; each room has one random monster of a certain difficulty level ; if you kill the monster , you get treasure ; accumulate a certain amount of treasure and return to the center of the board . There are four hero types to choose from , each has certain strengths and weaknesses ; some are better against higher level monsters , others can get around the board easier . Higher level monsters provide more treasure , but the heroes capable of defeating the higher level monsters need more treasure to win.It takes about 30-60 minutes to play.The game components are almost entirely cardboard ... sturdy enough , but I felt like the heroes would have been better as wood/plastic . The box has no storage elements , so the many cards / marking tokens can get jumbled together between plays ; you 'll want some baggies , rubber bands , or the like so you do n't have to resort everything every time you play.A good value in the $ 20-30 range .	1
As a dedicated gamer , I picked this up to play with my kiddo . All in all , quite a bit of fun . I think the suggested age of 8 is actually a little high . My daughter is 6 and picked this up quite easily . She really enjoyed looking at the `` treasure '' she acquired as she moved through the game . I think boys would enjoy the visuals of all the monsters on the monster cards . Really , its a fun and quick game that most families would enjoy .	1
I have many of the new games that have come out . In fact , a whole wall top to bottom . Out of all those games , my family and friends have played this one more than many of the games we have . I really really love this game ! It is my first pick when people come over to play and they ask what should they play . I recommend this game .	1
I love these expansions . Undermountain contains many big epic quests with high rewards , and encourages generosity when it requires you to place pieces around the board.Skullport is so lovingly tempting with its corruption . Allowing the big plays to come easy with just a small sidenote of a corruption , it can get out of hand depending on how badly you want some stuff.The only downsides are the flipped backs of cards and the differences in card sizes . Not a dealbreaker , but I wish they would modify it match and it would just be more seamless in looking better together with the main game.All in all , each expansion is fun and exciting .	1
Lords of Waterdeep was awesome , and Scoundrels of Skullport makes it even bigger , better , and crazier , like the original game on steroids . You get two expansions in one : Undermountain and Skullport . Both feature 3 new Lord cards , 3 new basic building locations ( each on a separate small game board ) , a ton of new buyable buildings , plus a huge amount of new quest and intrigue cards . Skullport includes a Corruption mechanic that penalizes your end-game points by the number of Corruption tokens ( blue skulls ) you have vs. how many remain on the included Corruption Track ( also on a small game board ) . You gain Corruption by using the awesome new buildings or completing some of the crazy new quests . Corruption is easy to gain but hard to get rid of ( ask any politician , lol ) , but the game includes a number of ways to get rid of it a bit at a time ( such as through using certain buildings , completing certain quests , or playing certain intrigue cards ) . Corruption management is vital . Do n't worry about it early , but be sure to start cutting back by mid-game and reversing the number whenever possible.This expansion also includes a 6th player faction , The Gray Hands , and an extra agent meeple for each color with optional rules to play a long game where everyone starts with an extra agent ( you must use the long game rules when playing with 6 people ) . There are also caravan tokens which stand in for large numbers of adventurer cubes in case the supply runs short . In a 3-player game , this only happened once , but I can see it being necessary with 4-6 players because you will gain a lot more adventurer cubes a lot faster using either or both expansions.Tried playing a 3p long game with both expansions , and it tripled the game time to almost four hours , but it ( mostly ) flew by . Part of the length was because we were learning the new rules and freaking out over the expansion 's super-powered new stuff , partly chatting , and one of the players suffers from `` analysis paralysis '' big time , with the other two having milder cases . Pretty sure the game would have only doubled in length if we were less chatty and more familiar with the expansions.Some of the new stuff seems like it might be underpowered or overpowered ( and we do n't like half the new Lords , including Xanathar who makes your Corruption penalty less , or Halaster Blackcloak and Sangalor who only score by buying their expansion 's buildings and completing its quests , which get diluted when using both expansions ) . Compare those lords to the one who lets you score 6 pts . from any 1 quest type of your choice , or 5 for each 10+ pt . quest you complete ) . There are several ways to play 2-3 or even more intrigue cards per turn , and that really slows the game down and feels unfair and overpowered to the rest of the players . That said , both my opponents in the 3 player game I mentioned had the ability to play multiple intrigue cards per turn and I still beat them by hardly playing any intrigue cards . I focused on Corruption management , going from a high of 7 to only 1 at the end , which was only worth -4 pts . to me ( instead of -28 pts ) , and solving as many double digit pt . Piety quests as I could ( including a 40 pt . one ) to get my Lord bonus of 6 pts . for any 1 quest type of my choice.If you combine both Undermountain and Skullport in the same game , you have to remove 12 buildings , 30 quests , and 25 intrigue cards from the base game to accommodate all the expansion stuff . That 'd be fine -- once -- but the rules want you to do it every time you play by randomizing which base set bits are removed . I 'm not sure I can imagine only playing with one set after trying both , so maybe the best solution in this case is just to yank all the crappiest stuff out of the base set once and never use them again . Also , when the game is prepped for using both sets next time , neither the new storage tray or base set hold the combined buildings and cards properly , resulting in unsightly sprawl with loose cards floating around and a bunch of buildings having to be split between both boxes -- which sucks.Nitpicks aside , I do love this expansion , and you get a TON of stuff to freshen up the game that will keep you going for months . It 's a great value and a lot of fun . It 's so big and crazy , I 'm not sure what the designers can do for the next expansion , but I 'm looking forward to finding out ! UPDATE # 1 : Decided after another game using both expansions at the same time that it 's just too swingy , too super-crazy , and unpredictable . And the Xanathar lord is broken and guaranteed to make you lose the game , so I 've thrown that card out until it gets an official fix . Tried a game using only Undermountain , and that played much more like the regular game , only reasonably souped-up . Game time was increased to about 2 hours , nothing crazy like the 4 hours using both expansions . And I completed four 40 point quests ! Will try using only the Skullport expansion next and update my review if necessary , but for right now , I 'm advocating you restrain yourself from trying the mega-game and just do Undermountain first , then Skullport , then maybe try to combine them once just to see what that 's like . But I think the expansions were not really meant or balanced to be used together.UPDATE # 2 : After playing just the Skullport expansion , I have to say I 'm not that fond of it or its Corruption mechanic . Undermountain is way more fun . Not that Skullport does n't have good stuff , just that a lot of it is overshadowed by Corruption . I 've decided to just streamline the base game and the expansions and weed out all the inferior or overpowered stuff ( including anything that gives or removes Corruption ) , mixing just the cards and buildings that are the most fun . Some of these cards and buildings never get bought or played , so what 's the point of bothering with them at all ? Still others are possibly broken and OP , like the Yawning Portal ( 4 gold cost building that gives the user 2 cubes of their choice and the owner one and basically hands them the game if they get it early enough ) , or the Undermountain building ( name escapes me ) that lets you play three Intrigue cards . And all the new cards that let you steal people 's buildings are unfair and create more hard feelings than fun . That still leaves a ton of good stuff to choose from . I 'm knocking my rating down to four stars after having played with this set for about a month . It 's not balanced well enough , and I hate that expansion games can take so much longer to play . The game is n't deep enough to support more than 60-90 minutes of play time .	1
Lords of Waterdeep : Scoundrels of Skullport contains two new separate expansions to the Lords of Waterdeep board game - Undermountain and Skullport - both coming with new mini boards , lords , quests , buildings and intrigue cards . The player can choose to add both or single expansion to the original game.The Skullport expansion also adds a new resource to the game , Corruption , with negative mechanic , while the Undermountain expansion features larger quests , super quests.Extra add-on is with this expansion you will get all the materials for sixth player which is great thing if you had additional player who until now could n't play.If you like to play Lords of Waterdeep this expansion is a must have , it will certainly increase your enjoyment of base game play .	1
Lords of Waterdeep is by far one of my favorite board games . It 's a worker placement type game , that is great for 2-5 players . This game is set in the Dungeons and Dragons universe , and while knowledge of the history is nice in that it would will let you recognize more of the land marks , it is not at all necessary to enjoy the game . I 've played lots of worker placement games , and this remains one of my favorites as it 's a solid middle ground , between rules heavy , and rules light . I highly recommend this board game .	1
My husband and I love Lords of Waterdeep . This is by far our favorite two player game so we were pretty excited when the expansion came out . The new quests , intrigue , and building cards are great . Adds some new fun ways to play . I do find that the new lords are pretty biased though . Some of them are shoe-ins to win the game and others are almost impossible . My husband and I are busy discussing the ways we can modify these new lords to make them more fair in game play . I 'm sure other people have been thinking the same ... . But other than these new lords , the new game play is fun !	1
LoW the base game has been the *most* popular and replayable board game . It 's good enough to play /w 2 people or 5 people.This expansion ( which is really two expansions ) makes EVERYTHING BETTER.You get Skullport ( new resource in the form of corruption/-points ) and Undermountain ( more intrigue , bigger quests ) and new lords , intrigue , and buildings appropriate to the new mechanics . You also get a new color to add a new player.We 've primarily played Undermountain and it makes the game MUCH more forgiving when there 's more players b/c it 's harder to 'lock ' a single player out of a key resource . My wife and mother in law do n't like the idea of corruption ( mom 's a little religious/goody goody ) so we have n't played it much , but based on reading through the buildings , cards , etc. , it adds a lot more volatility to determining who wins in the end.There 's extra agents to play a 'long game ' variant , which is nice ( broke 200 points once o.O ) .Some folks have mentioned issues with the first run ( which I think i have ) . The quest cards are printed 'upside down ' compared to the base game . Makes it easier to sort for us afterwards b/c we just sort based on orientation of the back of the card . There are icons on everything so you can easily see which expansion it belongs to.There 's a game mode that lets you play with both expansions , but then you remove cards and buildings from the original expansion , which can give you a lot of different synergies/combos compared to just playing with one expansion.There are some really cool synergies/combos around certain quests , intrigue cards , and buildings . For example , mom completed a quest that allowed her to draw an intrigue card after she plays one and then there 's another building that allows you to play multiple intrigue cards ( I think 3 ) and another quest ? I think that gives you victory points for intrigue cards . She literally could n't use all the intrigue cards she accumulated , but it was pretty fun and cool since we had to change our strategy to try to prevent her from playing intrigue cards.Finally , there 's a intrigue card that allows you to 'steal ' resources from an opponent , but then that player gets the intrigue card ( so they can 'attack ' you back later ) . The flavor text is : Cue Evil Laugh . So we made mom do an evil laugh everytime she used it , which is hilarious in and of itself .	1
Our group of friends gather weekly to play board games and the original Lord Of Waterdeep is a favorite with everyone . The more novice gamers find it accessible and fun and the hardcore gamers love the depth of strategy and re playability . Everyone appreciates it 's pacing as well , as it is a fairly quick game even with 5 players . This expansion , Scoundrels of Skullport adds many great new features . It essentially adds two possible new game modes . One simply expands upon the base game , adding more challenging but more rewarding quests , new lord cards , and new buildings . The second part adds the new corruption mechanic which is a lot of fun , and a great way to breathe new life into the game if you 've played it often with the same group . All pieces and packaging are of the same high quality fit and finish of the original game . If you enjoyed the base game , this is a must have expansion , and a great value for the price .	1
This is a really fun expansion to the great Lords of the Water Deep game . I gave it 4 stars because it can get a bit boring after about 7-8 games . But it does add to the play in different and fun ways . I find the cards that came with it more entertaining then anything on the board . the concept of skulls ( and negative points ) and derivatives of this is quite interesting particularly at first . You can incorporate this in . I will say though that if you are a savvy group of players you can learn to master this rather fast .	1
I 'm very pleased with this puzzle . First each train car is 98 % complete on each piece . It leaves just a small part of the animal ( s ) `` missing '' which helps the child locate the next piece ( for example , part of the 5th seal is missing on the # 5 train car -- my nephew looked for the seal 's face in order to find the # 6 car as he does n't yet recognize the numerals . The pieces are thick and will last a long time . The pictures are attractive without being too busy although the pics on the higher numbers are not placed for easy counting .	1
My son loves to put this together and take it apart . He loves that he can count the animals or objects on each car to see which one comes next . Only downfall is that its really long and take up a lot of space . We use on a wood floor , I imagine that it would be difficult to keep together on carpet .	1
My grandsons have enjoyed this during their younger years . 3-4 Big pieces make it easy to play with for young hands . Numbers are a an addl feature helping them learn the order up to twenty .	1
The Alphabet Train was a big hit in our house , and useful for working with letters , so we got this one . My kid has n't picked up all the numbers yet , but so far its been fun .	1
This is a fantastic puzzle/gift for young AND old . It is 32 triangular strong magnetic pieces that can fit together in a wide number of ways . It 's just great and you 'll have trouble keeping it away from the adults .	1
Our family really enjoyed spending hours competing with each other with this toy . I could n't imagine why they thought it was so fascinating because I do n't do well with these kinds of things , but the others did . In fact , the larger , more expensive Christmas gifts were ignored quite a bit of the time because they could n't stop playing with this .	1
I got this for my 5 year old and immediately wished I 'd gotten one for everyone in the family . It 's definitely her favorite toy that she got for Christmas this year , especially when she realized she could stick them to the fridge to make patterns !	1
A Christmas gift for my son who is into puzzles of all kinds . Since he has a habit of solving the smaller puzzles so fast , I thought I would try this . A great challenge and a fun way to kill a little time when you are having lunch or waiting at the doctor 's . He is enjoying it very much .	1
The first thing anyone who sees this for the first time is going to say is `` WHAT IS IT ? '' You 'll quickly come to the conclusion that 's a question much easier to ask than to answer.I guess the answer really is , '' It 's what ever you want it to be . `` I went to my Synonym Finder and here are just a few of the names I came up with.They are all names we have used , most are n't even in the dictionary , and any one of them could be used to describe this `` thing '' . Doohickie , dojigger , gizmo , whachamacallit , thingumajig , flumadiddle , widget , thingumabob , are all pretty good names ; but the inventor chooses to call it a `` Ball Of Whacks '' ; so I guess that 's what it is.The pictures and descriptions describe it as well as anything But what to do with it is the question.It comes with a small book of 96 pages that describes how and why Roger von Oech invented it and what you can do with it . He describes the very interesting mathematics that is the basis of the shapes of the pieces or `` whacks '' .To mathematicians , the Golden Ratio , the 30 sided rhombic triacontahedron , and such have always fascinated scientists and are found many places in art and nature , and in this ball.The inventor also explains what great creative qualities can be found with the ball.The book shows the inventor with a young Buddist monk creating a sun sculpture.This ball will fascinate anyone who picks it up , be they young , old , inquisitive or simply someone who likes to hold , handle and play with things.As soon as one realizes that reassembling it is not nearly as difficult as one might imagine ; then the creative juices start to flow and they try to see what they can form.The book gives a lot of sculptures or forms to make ; but in no time , one wants to try their own ideas.My ball has all the same colored `` Whacks '' , ( red ) ; but it comes in several colors and even in multi colors , where the various colors would add a whole other dimension to the creativeness of `` Ball Of Whacks '' .This product is excellently made , will provide endless hours of enjoyment , relaxation and creativeness for anyone who picks it up .	1
My 14 year old son got this for Christmas . He and his brothers ( and cousins of all ages ) played with it all day on Christmas . It was a big hit . The pieces are magnetic so they `` pop '' together in all kinds of shapes . Overall , great toy and fidget widget !	1
My kids love this toy . There are so many ways to play with it -- the magnets add an extra dimension to the creativity .	1
Many hours of fun for several different ages and grownups , too . Shared and enjoyed by many . My husband and I got it for a Christmas present for the 12-year-old grandson .	1
This is just a fun , creative toy . It starts as a ball and comes apart into mini `` pyramid-like '' pieces . From here , you can use your imagination and create new objects ( animals , stars , etc. ) . It also has a strangely soothing feel when you are putting it back together.The only drawback is that the magnets could be a little stronger . Sometimes it is hard to get your new creations to stay together because they slip . However , overall this is a really cool toy . Good for kids and adults .	1
My son loves playing with this toy . He cherishes it and fights over it with his siblings , i finally had to break down and buy one for all of them . He calls it the Diamond Ball	1
Definitely not a game for young children . It 's more geared for adults . And , it is kinda complicated . Make sure you have 4+ people to play , otherwise , it is n't too much of a game . But , it is SO MUCH FUN once the group knows how to play .	1
for many years now my family has been enjoying WIZARD its our very favorite card game . At least once a year I order replacement decks for all of us as we wear them out due to frequent usage . Its a game even the younger children have learned to play.Love the game !	1
We have been playing this game for a few years . I have given many games to others as we have taught them how to play it . I always keep a spare one on hand .	1
Friends recommended this game..it 's fun easily to learn and play ... we like that it 's small we keep it in our RV ! ~ Wizard ... is something I 'm glad we discovered ... play it for hours and never get bored ! ~	1
We love this game . Play it a lot with our camping friends . It is easy to play , and a lot of fun too .	1
I got this for my husband for Father 's Day and we love it ! We had played it with my family and loved it , so we wanted our own . It is a really fun game , but not too complicated . I would recommend it !	1
We have had a lot of fun playing this game . I usually play with my husband and 12 year old son . It is enjoyable .	1
Love this game and our family has been playing this for years . It is a game that more than 2 can playl	1
My son who is a game person had this . It was a little difficult to learn at first , but so much fun . I like that it is not totally all about strategy although there is some in it . Anyone can win .	1
I was n't sure how this would work for my 6 year old daughter , but because she loved to create her own stories , I thought it would be a fun project for me to help her with . She got it for Christmas and was immediately attracted to the box itself . : - ) She wanted to get started right away , but it was n't something I wanted her to rush through , so I waited for a snow day where she was home from school and we had all the time we needed.The instructions were clear and the markers had a nice variety of colors . My daughter decided to write her story about our newly adopted kitten . We first practiced by writing out the story on a regular piece of notebook paper and discussed how she would draw the pictures to go with her text . She even practiced the drawings a few times . Other than just being there to answer her questions or perhaps talk about what she wants to do , I did n't have to help her with any of it . I ca n't tell you how much fun it was watching my little author/illustrator at work ! Once she was ready for her final draft , we used the pages that came with the kit and she did each page how she wanted . There were plenty of extra pages so when she made a mistake , she was able to start over.The kit comes with loose book pages and an order form . You can select various cover choices and styles . Your child 's information is displayed in the book as the author and the dates . What a fun way to personalize this creation ! Once your book pages are completed and the order form is filled out , you just mail it in . I do n't remember exactly how long , but was pleasantly surprised that it was very quick . It is such a nice book ! The quality of the book is very nice ! It is certainly something that will be treasured for a very long time ! I would love to let her do another one soon ! I had just as much fun watching her as she did . If you have a child that loves to write and draw , this would be an excellent project for them . I think it would be great for children of all ages ! As with all of their work , is n't it all perfect ?	1
With this kit you or your child ( ren ) can write up to 12 pages of text , each with its own illustration , send it off to the company , and receive a professionally printed hardbound book in a few weeks . There are even options to get gift books , each with its own unique dedication page ! An 'About the Author ' section really personalizes the experience.Everything you need is in the kit -- instructions , paper ( including practice sheets ) and pens . There 's even a postage-paid envelope , so when you 're finished writing you can just drop it into a mailbox . We could not be happier with this product . It was fun and easy , brought out the kids ' imagination , and the product we received was beautifully finished.Highest recommendation .	1
As a retired teacher , I appreciated the creativity and fun this kit provides to young writers . I bought two , one for a 10 yrs old and one for a 12 yr old . We have n't created the books yet but I checked out the kits and and was impressed . They are of fine , professional quality . I am as excited as the children are to make these .	1
My daughter and two granddaughters received this for Christmas . There ages are 10 , 6 , and 4 . The little ones need some help from their mom but it was a great experience anyway . My 10 year old is hiding the book until she gets it published ; to surprise us with her life story.. The kids of all ages really enjoyed it . High quality , will purchase it again . Ca n't comment on the publishing stage as we are still in the & # 34 ; writing the book & # 34 ; phase .	1
I had heard about this product from another mother and decided to try it . My son is now 11 yrs old and is autisic with ADHD . He loves to writes stories about one specific character , but had a hard time with spelling . Illustory is a wonderful product that allows you to do your book draft on paper that is provided in the kit or you can do it online . He loves his book and we love this product.Mom of 3	1
9 year old loves this ! ! ! Instructions included to create books online too .	1
I bought this for my 8 year old niece last Christmas . It was a HUGE hit with her and everyone who has come in contact with her finished masterpiece . Everyone wants to know where I got it . This really helped my niece become more sure of herself and she now loves to write !	1
Wonderful product . We bought this as a gift for my son 's 7th birthday as a fun incentive to get him a little writing and spelling practice . He loved to make his own books at home with computer paper and the stapler , so a real book was a huge hit . He thought this was great because it is a real bound book with his own words and pictures . His book will be a cherished keepsake and I 'm sure it will be great fun to look at when he is grown .	1
I bought several kits for my daughter , who took her sweet time finishing her first book -- I was the impatient one ! She was 4 when she started it and 5 when she finished . We used the markers provided with the kit , but also Crayola 's Pip Squeaks washable markers , which came out fine.After she finished each drawing , I uploaded it to the website . I liked this option because it enables you to write and design much more -- you can control the layouts ( picture on top or bottom ? Text or no text ? All handmade drawings , or add `` stamps '' and online design elements ? ) . You can make the fonts bigger or smaller and get far more words in per page than if you send in the kit by mail and have a small word limit.There were no additional expenses whatsoever beyond the cost of the kit . A couple of reviewers seemed confused ( or paranoid ) about that ... the company does n't try to `` get you . '' You pay for the kit , they 'll mail you a book . If you want extra copies , of course you pay for that . But aside from that , we got back a beautiful book with an author photo just by typing in the tracking number that 's inside the kit on the online order form . It took 2-3 weeks to arrive , which felt like a long wait , but it was a very exciting day to see that box on the doorstep ! I love this both as a gift for my own daughter and as a thoughtful gift for her friends ' birthdays.I 'm an author , so it 's especially meaningful to me to preserve my daughter 's `` first book '' this way . Who knows ? Maybe she 'll follow in my footsteps ... in which case , `` Cat at the Beach '' could be worth a fortune on eBay someday . A fortune , I tell you !	1
I thought this product would be a wonderful idea for the creative child who likes to write stories and draw pictures , so I gave it to my 8 year old grandaughter . However , for some reason , she just was uninterested in doing the project . You have to write your own story and draw your own pictures , which she has done before . I guess she just was n't in the creative spirit at the time , because the kit is still in her closet unused . I still think it 's a great idea , but it probably takes a lot of parent participation and encouragement along with the child .	1
I ca n't wait to read how our adopt a special needs family through Adam 's Christmas Joy is going to write their story . This came and I actually wanted it for myself . I am going to order one for our family . MORE than I excepted . .	1
On our second one , that is how much fun kids who love to write have with this . Give it a try .	1
Bought this for Christmas 2012 for my daughter who was 6 at the time . She absolutely loved making this book . You have the option of showing the kids handwriting , or having it typed . You pick a book color and its hardcover . It looks really nice and professional . We have bought additional for gifts since then . I think it 's an excellent educational gift to give , and memories can be created that will last as long as you own the book ! The great part is that the assembling of the book is included with the kit that you buy here . It 's wonderful !	1
I purchased this for my four year old ( 2 1/2 years ago ) and when I was pregnant , we decided to write a book for the baby . The first misstep was that Grandma let the 4 year old open this up on his own and scribble all over the two `` cover '' s. So , our cover is a total scribble fest . When I tried to order a new cover sheet , the online cost was $ .20 totally reasonable . But , they would not give you a PDF file so you could print it , you are required to have it shipped to you for $ 5 . Then , there are quite a few rules/guides/limits about how many words and drawing with only the provided markers within the box.Why not have your child draw pictures , photograph them and make a photo book at shutterfly or other photo site ? That would be much more flexible and easier , if you ask me ...	1
As a teacher , I had to buy this gift for my seven-year-old niece . She loved making her own book , and the finished product that they send you is very professional looking , like a book that you would purchase from a store . They even included some tips and activities to help children write their stories , including diagrams for pre-planning and brainstorming . My niece loves her book and shows it off to everyone - she even took it to school and got to read it at storytime . This is a great educational activity that really gets children to be creative , and they love it . Buy it for all of your favorite kids !	1
LOVE THIS IDEA ! ! My daughter has already published her 1st book with Illustory and keeps asking for more . It 's a great way to have your child put together her thoughts on an event , subject , etc and put on paper , illustrate it with pictures and get a `` Real '' book mailed back to her . She 's already shared it with her classmates and teacher . I highly recommend this !	1
They absolutely loved this concept . They both are veryartistic and enjoyed putting this book together and then sending itoff to be printed. , They do n't read the book now , but they still have it andtheir mom plans to give it to them , many years down the road at their babyshower , for them to be able to read one of their own works to the baby , I thought that was a very sweet idea for this book !	1
My 6 yr old daughter loved this gift . The kit was simple and easy to understand . She wrote her own story one day , and we mailed it the next . There were no additional charges , not even for shipping , because we only wanted 1 book . The turn-around time was reasonable - I think around 4 weeks . The final product was beautiful and very solid . She ran around the house saying , `` I 'm an author ! I ca n't believe it ! '' We will definitely buy this product again in the future and we recommend it to others .	1
Product provides hours of fun and enjoyment / entertainment for our 1st grader . She has n't finished her story , yet . But , we are looking forward to her finishing it up so we can send it in for the final product .	1
Got this for my nephews years ago for christmas and they loved it so much that every year they ask for another one . They love coming up with the story and then drawing all the pictures . Then once it comes in the mail they are so pleased that they made their own story they take it into school , they show everyone who comes over and they will have it for the rest of their life to show their kids . This is amazing and i love doing it every year because it shows what they liked at the time and keeps them interested in learning .	1
My seven year-old received Illustory as a gift and it was by far one of the best gifts she 's ever gotten . She worked for many days on her story -- writing , drawing , coloring . After she was done , I scanned her work and submitted it over the internet . There is an option for mailing it in , but I wanted to include a photo of her in the author section.Online , I found that many more options for fonts and formatting are available . Only twenty words per page are allowed when submitting by mail . We can exceed that limit by submitting the work online.The book is limited to twelve pages ( unless one wants to pay additional fees ) , but it comes with lots of extra pages for drafting or fixing errors or just making a longer book . My son was intrigued by the process and took some pages to make his own book.The hardcover book that came in the mail today was small , but my daughter loves it . She 's been reading it over and over and shares it with everyone she knows.DETAILSThe Illustory price includes the cost of mailing in the story pages and the shipping fee of the final product.The company proofreads the story and prints it . One may opt to have it printed with the child 's misspellings and even in the child 's own handwriting.Online , the illustrations can be scanned in and uploaded or else the child may choose from the available illustrations . We used my daughter 's drawings , so I did not peruse much and do n't really know what they offer.NEEDS IMPROVEMENTFor the same price , one could print the same book on Snapfish . It would be bigger and come with twenty pages instead of twelve . It would take less time to process and arrive much sooner.My daughter 's book was submitted April 24 and did n't get here until today , June 2 . That 's a long time for an anxious little girl to wait.Of course , Snapfish charges shipping and handling , but they do have coupons.CONCLUSIONDespite the pricing , my daughter was inspired by the Illustory layout , which showed her where the pictures go and where her words would be . That helped inspire her more than a blank piece of paper ever could.This is a parent friendly gift . I appreciate it so much more than any toy . My daughter now has something that will last a lifetime -- her very first book ! She is so proud of it . This was fun , educational , and milked her creative juices.P.S . FOR TEACHERSIllustory does give free books to classrooms . They are soft cover , but the whole bookmaking process is the same . Details are on the company website .	1
what a nice change . A fun toy that you can use your own imagination to create something . Used it to create a narrative story and sent it in for the book . All went well and we are pleased with all facets of this toy .	1
They include a set of markers and paper . Be aware of the extra fees associated with writing on too many pages . Read all their papers carefully and count everything . They added on fees , contacted me by mail which slowed down the process , and they should allow more pages for the price . My daughter did this years ago , and now at 11 she did again and still loves this . This is a great idea and I am not sure if anyone else offers such a product . The first book went smoothly . The second book they spelled her name wrong , and the return process was really awful . They reprinted the book , and although they fixed the typos throughout the book ( ones that my daughter did n't spell incorrectly , ones they did ) , the condition of the book when they shipped it back was beaten up a bit on the spine , but I do n't want to go through the process of returning again based on the experience the first time . If they improve their customer service with the typos , improve the marker set , and shipping situation , this company would do much better . I doubt I would do this again even though my daughter loved it .	1
My son is now working on his second book - after last year 's success , we will be doing a book every year ( he 's 6 now ) . The book takes time to do properly , and certainly needs an adult 's help at this age , but the end result is more worthwhile than virtually any other gift he 's gotten . The look on his face , seeing his name and story and pictures put together in the beautifully bound book ... I 'll never forget it , and I never have to . It happens every time he reads HIS book ! Highly recommended	1
Being an author and reviewer when my grandchild asked for this kit as a present I was thrilled . It 's always nice to see a child want to follow in your footsteps . Was it worth the money ? You bet it was.Inside is everything that was needed for her to use to create her first book . The instructions were easy to follow and she got right to work.What a great book was made . Her illustrations were exactly as she drew them and she was thrilled to see her very own story come alive . She loves being able to share it with others and it has given her great pride to see she has a book just like her Grammy.This is well worth your money and will bring a lot of joy and happiness to any child that receives it . I am proud to recommend this product .	1
I bought for my nephew 's birthday ... he 's 4 years old . I loved the idea of giving him the ability to write his own book , illustrate it , and then to be able to have a real one made was just cool . Initially , the concept was a tad lost on him , but he soon understood . Once he understood he was really excited . A cool little present but it also a present that the parents or another adult will have to help with ... .it an activity ... a memory . I have not seen the finished book as of yet but will update when I do .	1
This has been my daughter 's favorite gift of all time . She drew all the pictures , then dictated the story to me . Her face , when we received a hard-bound real book in the mail was priceless ! I 'd like to do one of these every year . You ca n't pick a better gift than this one .	1
This is a really fun conversation starter , especially on car rides . When we started playing it , we put the little tokens back in the box and never looked at them again . We found it a lot more fun to just ask and laugh at the responses and justifying why you would pick one over the other . Our games usually wandered off the cards whenever someone thought of something , but if you were stuck you could use the cards.I would recommend a purely cards-only version , no tokens or 'rules ' just give us the scenarios .	1
While on vacation my kids ' got hooked on the Would You Rather Questions that we found . So we got the card game for home to play as a family . It 's fun to play with the whole family !	1
Cute card game , great for traveling with teens or other adults . We travel by car a lot and this game is small enough to keep in the glove box and have on hand when the boredom sets in .	1
This is a cute book that we bought to use as a surprise on an airplane . We bought this for my 2 1/2 year old and she still uses it 1 year later . The stix 's stay sticky after several uses . The book does get some residue on it after each use , but that would come clean with some water or windex .	1
My son has been asking me for bendaroos for the longest time so i got him these since they are pretty much the same thing . i believe the only difference is that the wikkistix have an adhensive quality that lets them stick to glossy books or other shiney surfaces . the book included is very amusing and give kids creative ways to use the wikkistix . for example there is a page with under water scenery with seaweed and such and you use the wikkistix as if they are seaweed and create other under water critters or scenery . my son wraps them around his pencils , toys , and uses them in other books . overall he has a lot of fun with them and it allows him to express some creativity . the other day he made me `` heart balloons '' with them . my 2yo mimics what he does and they can play together easily without fighting over them since there are many .	1
I got this for a six hour car drive to entertain a 4 year old boy . It kept him busy for quite a while . I do n't let my son play with car toys except when we are on long trips ( they stay novel then and he is kept busy for longer requiring less frequent stops and we can keep driving ) so I ca n't speak about durability or if the wax sticks will keep up their sticking power . It took my son a while to realize he did n't have to follow the books directions and could make his own designs but I think that is a function of age rather than product design . Over all I think this is a worth while purchase for travel .	1
This was a gift to my grandchildren and theyloved , loved , loved this so much that theyare all gone . What a way to go to have somethingthat teaches the hands to create	1
THis game only got 4 due to the luck factor . No matter how well you play , you could just draw bad cards everytime . That is it . Other than that , this is a wonderful , wonderful game . This IS the perfect game to get people into Eurogames like Settlers of Catan and Carcassonne . Easy to explain - 5 minutes tops . Fast to play - 1 hour . Good strategy . Good theme . You even feel like you are being educated at least a little bit in the area of US geography.Bottom Line : Best family board game in existance . Anyone can learn to play it relatively quickly .	1
This is an excellent board game , with a reasonable mix of skill and luck involved . Depending on how many people are playing , and how quickly they take their turns , this game can take anywhere between thirty minutes and two hours . The rules are simple , and while experienced players have an advantage against beginners , people can get up to speed after a few turns of their first game . Strategies for winning consistently can be gained after only one or two games.There are many versions and expansions for this game , all of which are fun and interesting and worth looking at to see which best suits your group of players . But , this is the most basic form of the game and has the most straight-forward set of rules : - You have & # 34 ; tickets & # 34 ; telling you which cities your trains need to connect in order to earn points , if at the end of the game , the connection is n't completed , you get a negative point value for that & # 34 ; ticket & # 34 ; .- You have colored & # 34 ; train car & # 34 ; cards , which you combine to build connections between cities . If a connection is colored , you need that color to make the connection and if it is grey , then you can use any one color to make the connection.- On each turn , you can either : build a connection between two cities ; select a new & # 34 ; ticket & # 34 ; ; draw two & # 34 ; train car & # 34 ; cards from 5 visible possibilities or from the face down deck.- There are & # 34 ; locomotive train car & # 34 ; cards , which are wild , but are more expensive to draw from the visible cards ( only get one ) .- The longer the set of train cars used to make a connection , the more points you earn ( 1=1 , 2=2 , 3=4 , 4=7 , etc . ) - Whoever has the longest connection at the end , by train car length , gets additional points.The expansion versions add other possibilities , depending on the map ( tunnels that can take more than one card to complete ; ferries that require at least one locomotive ; etc. ) . Some of the maps/expansions are better suited to more players and others are limited to just two or three players . You can probably find a version of this game that is best suited for your group , but this basic version is a good version to start with.I would also highly recommend the PC or mobile version of this game , which can provide access to many of the maps and give you an idea as to which version of the game you would prefer , without buying all of them.Overall , this is one of the best board games out there , well suited to beginning players or more advanced board gamers .	1
I ca n't say enough about this game . This is one that wins many times when asked what to play in our family and it has been a long time favorite . I wo n't spend a lot of time describing the game as that is easy to find elsewhere on [ ... ] and here . What is important is that this game can be played with as many as 5 players ( although I wish it could be more ) but can easily be played with 2 and the age groups can really span 6 or 7 up to any age.The game board is quite large so requires some space to play it and there are a lot of pieces . The cards and pieces however are very durable and last for multiple playings . The add-ons for the game add a tremendous amount of value although I 've only played other maps online and using their iPad version . That said , I still prefer the USA map.Honestly , if you do n't have this game , you owe to yourself to buy it and complete your collection . I ca n't recommend this game enough !	1
This is my families first experience with a game like this and we love it ! We had so much fun playing together and how refreshing not to play a game with money . This game is high quality and focuses on points . This game is not overly complicated like others we have attempted to play and takes about an hour for players of 3-4 . I love that there is a little bit of strategy and people can block off you routes if they catch on to where you are headed . This will be a family favorite !	1
I did n't think that I was going to like this game going into it , because the game is about building train routes and not very complex . I was wrong . This game is just pure fun to play.There 's nothing like working towards a specific goal with no idea if it will all pan out in the end and then seeing your game long plans come together at the last minute . Actually completing those city to city route objectives was the source of the most satisfaction to me not necessarily scoring more points than my neighbor , which is rather refreshing in a game.The game components were nice although the very small size of some of the cards stood out immediately . They are still workable for adult hands though . Some of my train pieces were chipped slightly and appeared to have some grime on them , which was odd . Also the game board itself did n't like to lay completely flat on the table.Game component issues aside , this is a very fun yet simple game to play for the entire family .	1
Feels like a strategic train routing game . I really enjoyed playing with my friend and family . Really good buy . Loved it	1
This is a great medium concentration game . The strategy is not too tricky , but challenging enough to hold your interest . Basically , you either collect or play train cards on your turn . You need to have the same number and color to play on a route , and then you connect your routes to match the bonus on your ticket . The score for routes increases by the number of train cards needed , from 1 point for 1 to 15 points for 6 . My only complaint is that there are a few tickets that might be weighted a little high and lucking into one of these on the initial draw gives a slight advantage . You get a higher bonus to connect farther apart cities , but some of these have longer routes between them which give you a bonus already . Overall , a solid and very fun game.I have not yet had the chance to play it with 2 , but I know from experience that it works equally well with 3 , 4 or 5 .	1
Though just purchased last month , this is by far our favorite game . Even my 7 year old son loves this game , though he prefers the card game version because he ca n't get his routes blocked . Simple to learn ( 5 minutes to figure out ) , but every game is complicated due to competition for routes and constant recalculating of routes .	1
Ticket to Ride is well made , fun for our whole family , and I like that my son is picking up a bit of geography as we play.I 'm sure we 'll pick up the 1910 expansion for the normal size cards and additional routes . My ONLY complaint about this game is the tiny cards . This game is a favorite and will be enjoyed for many years .	1
My husband and I are in our early 20s , and this is one of our favorite games . We can play with 2-5 players , including kids , and teach people very quickly how to play . The set includes a board , train pieces , and small cards . You add strategy by maximizing your trains by going to multiple destinations . I enjoy the Europe version a little bit better because there are more destinations , but my husband likes U.S. better because Europe has fewer long destinations . We did buy the 1910 version , which you almost have to buy if you play often because it gives you more destinations and larger cards . If you have little children , the little trains might not work so well , but we recommend this game for most age groups .	1
This game is very easy to learn ( I do n't understand any of the negative reviews saying it 's & # 34 ; too complex & # 34 ; ) and lots of fun , as long as you 're not the big loser in any particular game . Imagine getting hemmed in and locked down in Settlers of Catan , multiplied by 100 . That 's how frustrating this game is if you happen to choose the wrong path cards which ( unbeknownst to you at the time ) conflict with someone else 's ambitions . Satisfaction with the game is very hit and miss , as it can be VERY tedious when you have no chance of accomplishing your objections . Part of the appeal of the game is also one of its biggest drawbacks : you can easily see how well you 're doing compared to everyone else , which means that you can also tell very easily when you have no chance at all of winning .	1
This is a very fun and educational game . Players use cute trains to build `` tracks '' across the US to different cities completing a card that details what cities need to be linked to get points . Its very easy to learn . The only thing is that it can be complicated to score the game-we tend to do it at the end of the game rather than trying to do it during play . This is one of the few games that is fun with just two players . Very Entertaining ! ( ticket to ride Europe is also fun ) .	1
This is such a fun game , and it move so quickly it really keeps the players on their toes to act quickly and stay focused . The rules are extremely simple , and its a great game to play with beginners due to its simplicity . High education rating for geography within the United States ( and any other country that you play ) .	1
Ticket to Ride is easy to learn , fairly quick to play . It is a great gateway game from traditional American games into the ( to me ) more fun world of Euro games .	1
My friends and I absolutely love this game ! It is quite fun and very entertaining.I enjoy playing this with about 4 people total.Anymore and things get a little messy.I like this game too because it does n't take a very long time . It runs about 45 minutes .	1
Inspired by & # 8216 ; Around the World in 80 Days & # 8217 ; , Ticket to Ride is a blast . I was impressed with how involved yet laid back the gameplay is . This is a quietly strategic game that will challenge you to make the right moves at the right time . The concept is to travel to and from specific destinations , but the key is that no one is aware of where you are going or where you are starting from and the routes to each destination can vary depending on the cards you have in your hand . You can select multiple routes , which allows you to travel to different destinations at the same time , and while you do get points ( visible points ) for each route to lay down , you get extra points tallied at the end of the game for each ticket you complete , and because you keep your tickets hidden from other players , no one is aware of how many you have completed and how many points each of your tickets is worth . In other words , when we played this the other night I was in last place on the board and wound up winning by over 70 points because I had completed far more tickets than anyone else ! This was a blast .	1
I 've known about this game for a while and I can not believe it took me so long to actually buy it . Very easy to learn the game and get playing , but unless you are playing nicely , takes a long time to master . There are so many ways to try to get to where you are going , counting out how many trains left , spaces required , what you can get away with to screw over your opponent . Game is awesome . I can not really do it justice in words.Easy game to learn . Highly strategic . even my 5 year old enjoyed it for the 20 minutes I could keep him interested !	1
I am sure the fact that I won decisively the first time we played has Nothing to do with my positive feelings about this game ! : ) Seriously , though , it 's a fun play for a group of 4 or 5 adults . Relatively quick and easy to understand , but with enough chance that the smartest guy at the table ( i.e . my husband ) may not win 80 % of the time like he does in many other games . There are also enough hidden point multipliers that the winner may not be apparent until the game is nearly over , which helps those who seem to be trailing keep up their interest . I am sure we 'll be playing this for many weekends to come .	1
This game is amazing and it is clear how it has won so many awards world wide . I would recomend this for any family .	1
We like to play games in our family . As the children got older we got tired of the run-of-the-mill board games . We now enjoy looking for and trying out new and interesting boardgame options.One of our treasured finds is `` Ticket to Ride . '' It is no mystery to board game enthusiasts that this is a great game , but just in case you do n't run in those circles or visit those web sites , here 's the scoop on this game.What you should know about this game if you are considering it:1 ) It can accommodate up to 5 players.2 ) The game works best for players aged 10 and up ( though the box says 8 and up ) . Our 9-yr-old was able to pick up on this game , but it takes a bit longer to play than her gaming attention span is at the moment , and she likes to play games.3 ) This game may take up to an hour to play , though quicker play by experienced players can cut that time in half.In this game players are competing rail barons in the year 1900 . At the start of the game each player draws three destination cards that indicate the beginning and ending cities of a RR line ( e.g. , Denver to New Orleans ) . Players choose to keep at least two of those destination cards and they collect colored RR car cards that they can trade in to claim segments of RR lines needed to connect cities on their destination cards . Players earn points for each RR segment they complete , for completion of the RR indicated on destination cards , and for completing the longest continuous RR line.As as you play you need to beware that as you are working to complete a RR line you could be blocked either accidentally or on purpose ( depending on the personalities of your competitors ) when another player builds on a RR segment you need . If that happens , that just means that you need to find an alternative way to get to complete the RR line between your destinations.It takes good judgement to decide when and where to build your RR segments , as well as when to select additional destination cards.Just so you know , on a player 's turn they can either collect up to two colored RR car cards , build a RR segment , or draw new destination cards.This is a fun game that can be enjoyable for tweenaged children and grown-ups alike.Since there are way more destination cards included with the game than can be built during any one game , and since the shuffling of those cards , as well as the large number of colored RR car cards is large , the game is never the same twice.Another perk of this game , in addition to it 's overal enjoyability is the fact that as you play you can learn some geography of North America ( some Canadian cities are also included ) .Fun and educational.When you are ready to move beyond games like `` Candyland '' , `` The Game of Life '' , etc. , try this one out.Also , just in case you did n't know , there are also other versions of `` Ticket to Ride '' for Europe , Germany , and Switzerland ( some of which are stand-alone games , and some of which are expansion games ) .In any case , this particular game is a solid 5-star option , easily played ( once you get through your first few games ) .I hope this was helpful .	1
Everyone in our family enjoys this - aged 9 through teen years and to the adults . What we love is how we can play together in competition while also working on individual goals . Each player has to try to gather enough of the right colored cards to make train route connection across North America , earning points as your train route grows in length . Players try to block each other . Strategy can be simple for the younger kids or more complex for the adults . It is best played with 3 or more . I like most that 5 can play easily .	1
Ticket to Ride is the board game I most often reach for when I have family visiting . For the middle-school aged nephews and the `` hard to teach an old dog new tricks '' crowd , Ticket to Ride is very easy to pick up on the rules.And those rules ? They can be boiled down to `` It 's like Gin Rummy ... with little plastic trains '' . Collect cards of matching color sets , then use those sets to claim your tracks to connect cities into a grand network . But watch out for your fellow railbarons , who might have designs for that Los Angeles to El Paso route ! Even though I also play quite complex and multi-layered board games , I 've never not had fun with Ticket to Ride . It plays quickly , and even the slowest to learn players pick up on how to do well in just a couple rounds .	1
This is a great game . I was introduced to this game by my daughter and her husband . It takes skill and strategy to determine the best way to build your tracks and get from one city to the next without having to take the long route .	1
The USA version of Ticket To Ride is fun but frustratingly cutthroat ; I would not recommend getting the base set without theDays of Wonder Ticket to Ride 1910 Expansion , which offers three superior variants , more tickets ( routes ) and regular sized playing cards to replace the tiny ones included in the base set . The main problem with the base set is that whoever builds the big northern routes usually wins , exacerbated by the awarding of a `` longest route '' ticket worth bonus points . The 1910 expansion offers you the choice of eliminating the longest route bonus and awarding a `` most routes completed '' bonus instead , or using both of them , or neither . That helps tailor the win condition to best suit the group.However , I still prefer theTicket to Ride Europewith theDays of Wonder Ticket to Ride 1912 Expansionbecause of it provides more interesting challenges ( ferries and tunnels ) and adds stations players can use to get around being cut off in completing their routes . These stations can easily be used in USA or other versions . Europe still has the `` longest route '' bonus points award but this is easier to get for everyone because if you have to use a station to complete a route ticket , it no longer counts toward your getting the longest route award.Another excellent option over the USA version is theDays of Wonder Ticket To Ride - Marklin ( Germany ) version that adds passengers you can use to score crazy bonus points that add a whole new strategy to the game ; unlike the stations in Europe , however , the passenger mechanic is not easily integrated into other editions . Another nice thing about Marklin is that it offers the most balanced map with a near equal distribution of long and short routes which are split up on the left and right sides of the vertical map . With Marklin , completing a ton of short routes is just as viable a win strategy as long routes in the USA base sets.Both Europe and Marklin also split your initial ticket allotment into long ( blue-backed ) and short ( brown-backed ) routes ; you get to choose how many of each you want to do -- unlike the USA base set , which is totally random in its ticket distribution ( long routes are harder to complete but offer more bonus points to win than short routes ) .I also enjoy theTicket to Ride Switzerland Map ExpansionandDays of Wonder Ticket to Ride : Nordic Countries Board Game . Both Switzerland and Nordic Countries are designed for only 2-3 players , unlike the usual 2-5 ) so they are great options for smaller groups . They also offer the two most challenging maps . Unfortunately , Switzerland is out-of-print and online sellers are charging a fortune for it . You can play it and the USA and Europe versions online , however , for a much more reasonable cost ( live opponents or vs. the computer ) . I 've played the online version almost 1,000 times since August 2010 but I still love playing the board games . They are my favorite board games of all time ! One thing to watch out for , in my opinion , is that the original USA edition is initially fun but that fun can turn to frustration once you realize the easiest way to win is to just build the long northern routes . That problem is corrected with the 1910 Expansion by providing new route tickets , a new way to score bonus points , and two variants : Big Cities and USA Mega-Game -- the Mega-Game uses everything in the expansion set and is my favorite way to play Ticket To Ride : USA ) . However , I still prefer the maps and additional challenges ( like building ferries and tunnels ) that are provided by the Europe and Marklin editions.No matter which version you pick , if you know how to play one , the others are easy to pick up , and the rules of all editions are fast and easy to learn in about 5 minutes.Ticket To Ride is , in my opinion , the best light strategy ( or `` gateway '' ) game on the market to bring family and friends together . Actual game time may vary depending on the number of players , their familiarity with the maps and rules , and how quickly they can strategize and complete their turn ( most turns are finished in a minute or less but some could last up to 5 , especially when choosing additional route tickets ) . I 'd say every version of Ticket To Ride ( even with expansions ) takes about 60 minutes on average but a game could last anywhere from 30-120 minutes ( the difference between having 2 players vs. 4-5 , for example , and/or if some newbie players need rules or strategy help , or are just really bad at making decisions and revising their strategy on the fly ) .	1
I bought this for me and my husband . We love to play , I just wish the game lasted longer between two people .	1
We are Settlers of Catan board game fans through and through , but we needed something that was comparable in fun so we could take a break from Catan . This is perfect . It is very easy to learn and very easy to teach to newcomers . The game play is also very simple ( but you use a lot of strategy as well ) . Ticket To Ride also has a few small expansion that we love as well !	1
My nephew ( 14 ) suggested this game for my son ( 7 ) . It could n't have been a better suggestion . Our son loves trains and understand math well enough to enjoy this game.It 's actually fun for me , too . It 's really a smarter version of Monopoly .	1
Purchased as birthday for our son . It has become a family favorite . A larger than typical game board ; well made and nicely packaged . Planning to buy the expansions and alternate versions . Decision to buy was strongly influenced by the & # 34 ; Spiel des Jahres & # 34 ; award .	1
This game is really fun , easy to play , and moves quickly . We really like playing this with friends even when our kids are around because it does not require your 100 % attention all of the time .	1
When the kids come to visit this is one of the GO TO games we play . Great fun - we have played for hours .	1
This is a great game because it 's a simple concept ( enough for young children to play ) but still has a strategy component.Take too long in building a train , and someone else takes it , which ruins your entire game plan.Overall , it takes roughly 45-60 minutes to play , so this is a bit of a longer game.It 's great construction and has held up well to a lot of use . This is a game in our rotation that we play at least every few game nights .	1
This game will provide hours of fun . There is mild strategy involved , but not too complicated for your casual gamer . This is a nice game if you have a hour to kill . I have recommended this to friends and to my knowledge , no one has said & # 34 ; I wish I did n't play that game & # 34 ; after completing the game ( unless they are a poor sport ) .	1
This is an absolutely wonderful game . I own about 300 games , and would easily put this up in the top ten of them . It 's great for kids and adults , it 's easy to learn and explain , it looks great , it does n't take too long , it 's a great combination of luck and strategy , it plays great with 2 through 5 people ... . I could go on and on . But why take up your time when you could be BUYING THIS GAME ! ! Congratulations to Amazon and Toys R Us for noticing this gem .	1
This is my go to game that I bring with me for new gamers or gaming groups . It 's one of the essentials to own . Easy to learn , fun to play . mechanics are rock solid , and the components all just work .	1
I brought a bunch of friends over to play board games and none of them had even heard of this . Within only a few minutes , they all fully understood the game and a couple of them are planning to buy their own copies of it now . It 's a great game and worth the buy for playing with friends or family .	1
OK so I 'm not into strategy games ( because I am horrible at those games ) and I think their really boring . And I was on the fence about this game but I was at a meet up and a group was playing it and their bragging how it 's the best game ... .So I came home and researched it and had tons of great reviews . So I decided to but it without ever playing it . Although I ca n't say it 's the best game ever only because I am a into party games , but this is by far the best strategy game I have ever played . I am trying to get my fiance to play games ( not a gamer ) and he loves it too . It is so easy to learn ! ! ! The instructions are so overwhelming , so what I do is go online and watch other people explain the rules and play , because seriously instructions are hard to understand . Definitely worth it and would absolutely recommend Ticket to Ride	1
As others have noted , this game is a perfect way to spend quality time with spouse and/or kids . If nothing else , it can familiarize kids with geography , which is something kids do not seem to get enough of these days . The game does not have the strategic depth of say Civilization or Chess , and for that some serious gamers turn their noses at this game a bit . But that is not the niche this game serves . This game is designed to draw groups of people together for the sake of having fun . And for that purpose this game meets this goal and then some . I can easily see our family playing this game once a week . The rules are simple , but do n't be fooled : just because this game does not have the strategic depth of some other games out there , there is still thinking and strategy involved . There will be many opportunities in this game to foil your opponents and you are constantly asking yourself on a turn `` Should I try to achieve MY goal , or should I block theirs ? '' In my opinion , families who play Monopoly could repalce Monopoly with this game and would be glad they did . This game sort of scratches the same itch that Monopoly attempts to scratch , only this game does it FAR better . Monopoly does not have enough mechanics and variety to justify the time spent ; Ticket to Ride does.Another note : Days of Wonder puts a lot of attention into quality and detail . The board itself is impressive . Some may wish the plastic trains were wood , but I think they are fine . Even the box is well made with several compartments to separate the cards and pieces .	1
Ticket to Ride : 2-5 Players , Ages 8+ , Average Play Time = 45-60 MinutesThe average game plays out the same way ninety-nine percent of the time ... draw train cards ... draw train cards ... make a connection and score points ... draw train cards ... draw train cards ... make a connection and score points ... draw train cards ... draw train cards ... draw train cards ... etc . Players will sometimes draw ticket cards if they feel that they can make the new random connections the cards task them with before the game is over , but doing this is optional.Ticket to Ride is a great game for kids and adults alike , despite its repetitiveness . The gameplay is fairly simple and turns go smoothly ... that is ... all you 're doing is either drawing to match like colors or placing like colors on the board to make connections . You are n't managing stocks or trying to figure out if the D-20 you rolled entitles you to a critical hit because someone else played an interrupt card . For this reason , everyone in the house ( with the exception of the person who hates board games ) enjoys playing this game . The thirteen year old says that this is her favorite game to play , because it is `` fun . '' The ten-year old enjoys the whole `` train theme '' and making connections.As for me , I enjoy it because of the strategy element . If I see one of the kids trying to make an obvious connection between two distant cities , for example , I may decide to make my own connections to block them . Players ca n't make connections over someone else 's , meaning they have to make detours if they really wished to continue to make their original connection . Some city routes have dual connections to combat this . I enjoy the strategy of placing connections based on what my ticket cards require me to do without making it too obvious . Rather than form a long chain of trains , I 'll place a connection here and a connection there so that my route is n't obvious until it is almost complete . By then , it 's usually too late for anyone to block me.I highly recommend you give this a try , especially if you are looking for something new to play on family game night .	1
Got for son for x-mas , just turned 7 . He has always been thrilled with trains , and loves board games . Opened up on X-mas , was so surprised when he seen all the contents , and mapping . 3 days after the shock of the Wii wore off we started playing during his winter break . Now play at least once a week . He is getting better with the strategy of the game and point scoring . Can play in a short period of time , moves along fast once you learn how to play . It is a little more expensive then average board game , feel that is well worth it .	1
After noting that Ticket to Ride continues to be one of the highest-rated board games at numerous board gamer sites , we bought a copy.The board gamers are right . This German-made game beats familiar games like Monopoly and Risk hands-down.OBJECTEach player must complete a series of rail lines spanning cities based upon destination cards drawn at the beginning ( and throughout ) the game . Each destination carries points related to the length of the line , so a New York to Los Angeles line would score more points than Chicago to Boston . Incomplete destinations count against players at the end of the game , so completing them , even through circuitous routes is a must . The exciting part of the game comes from not knowing who is completing his or her lines , plus the ability to overlap lines , stymieing other players.Game play takes between 30 and 90 minutes depending on the number of players and the speed at which they make decisions.GAME PIECESHigh quality throughout , the game includes : - A fold-out board of the United States and southern Canada , plus a scoring track around the edge . The cities on the board connect through colored track lines , each line between one and six units in length.- A set of destination cards showing lines that must be completed.- Five sets of forty-five train pieces . Each player takes one same-color set of trains.- A set of colored train cards that correspond to the colored lines that connect cities.- Scoring markers that correspond to a player 's train color.PLAYEach player is dealt three destination cards in the beginning and must keep at least two . These form the basis for their lines . They also receive four train cards . To claim a line , players must create sets of the same color and number of train cards as the line connecting two cities . ( The color of the lines has nothing to do with the player 's train color , but the cards they have in hand . ) Each player , in turn , can perform one of three actions:1 . Draw two train cards per turn from either the set of five placed up for all players to see , or blind from the train card deck . ( One card if one of the showing wild cards is chosen. ) 2 . Play a set of matching train card colors to claim a line between two cities.3 . Get dealt a new set of three destination cards , keeping at least one.Players score points when they claim a line of track connecting two cities , the length of the track yielding proportionately higher scores . Scoring markers are moved around the 100-point scoring guide on the board perimeter.When one player has laid all his or her train pieces , the other players get one last turn . Players then reveal their destination cards and add ( or subtract , for incomplete lines ) to their total . The longest continuous length of claimed track scores additional points , too . Highest point total wins.REVIEWPros : A gorgeous , well-made game that 's easy on the eyes , Ticket to Ride combines simple rules and nail-biting game play with a significant level of strategy . You ca n't ask for more in a board game.All ages will love this game . Even children as young as six can play since the rules are simple.Will please folks sick of the usual board games everyone has.Game play is short enough to allow multiple sessions of play.The manufacturer has other games in the Ticket to Ride series that work off the same basic gaming system , though with differing degrees of skill ( through additional rules and trickier city layouts ) . Expansion kits exist , too , so players familiar with the game can get an additional kick out of their existing set . Lastly , an online , multi-player , interactive version of the game can be played through the manufacturer 's Web site.Cons : The manufacturer lists a game session as lasting 30-60 minutes . We 've found it closer to 45-90 minutes.Ticket to Ride has been around since 2004 and is beginning to show some age when compared against newer European-style board games . In addition , other games in the Ticket to Ride series eclipse the base game ( though some expansions require the base game for play ) . For a game that plays similarly to Ticket to Ride but adds more depth of play , consider Ticket to Ride designer Alan Moon 's Airlines Europe.OVERALLAs someone who loves games , I found Ticket to Ride to be a great introduction to European-style board games . Nothing disappoints . Everyone who plays the game wants to know where to get a copy . Ticket to Ride has won numerous Game of the Year honors around the world , and it 's easy to see why . Absolutely worthy of its stars.UPDATE : For enhanced play , consider the 1910 expansion . It includes larger , easier-to-read cards , additional destinations , and more winning conditions . It makes a four-star game into five !	1
Who knew building train tracks would be fun ? In this game you have to build tracks around the US and secure the routes that you draw on your cards . Its really fun to try to build your routes , and once you get 4 players involved the competition factor really ramps up because you will all be going for those middle spots . Not much coop factor here unfortunately , but still makes a fun family game with no too much fighting or rule book checking .	1
It just might be . at least top 5 in my book . I would recommend this game to anyone , I bought this copy for my sister .	1
I 've been buying several board games to get the family ( parents and 2 kids , 10 years , 8 years ) spend more valuable time together . Amongst several board games we found this a great game.Highly recommended .	1
The game is kinda easy but yet interesting . Good time spent with the family - we played it several times in 2 weeks and it has not annoyed us yet .	1
This game , along with Settlers of Catan and Carcassonne , is one that I always use as a 'Gateway Game ' to get friends and family who are not serious board gamers hooked on games.Ticket to Ride is easy to teach and learn , fun to play over and over again , and does n't take too long to get through ( most games lasting under an hour ) . The game does n't suffer from a lot of random chance ( e.g . no dice rolling ) and relies on player planning and skill to win . There is the option to go after other players and have a pretty cut-throat game , but that is not necessary to gameplay if it is not your style.If you are already a big fan of board gaming but you have n't played any of the Ticket to Ride games , skip this one and go straight for Ticket to Ride Europe . It has a few additional more complicated elements such as ferries and tunnels , and a more complex and congested map board .	1
We purchased this for a Thanksgiving family gathering.Our 10 year old could play and stay focused.Our 8 year old played as a partner with an adult.We are curious to see the Europe one.Our extended family that really gets into board games and strategy and competition enjoyed this one quite a bit .	1
Love this game ... My husband loves board games and I 'm not always as enthusiastic but this is one I find I can enjoy with him .	1
As thier name implaies , Days of Wonder publish solid games , with outstanding mechanics , fantastic art work and all in a box with pieces to touch and move around ! What more can the little kid in my big kid body what more !	1
love this game . we have made our friends learn to play it and have even bought on ipad for traveling .	1
This is a great example of a game that has simple enough rules that anyone could play . However , if you 're playing with people who are really good at it , the strategy becomes really complex !	1
My family is huge into board games , especially strategy based games . My children and I got this game for my husband for his birthday and right away we became addicted to it.It is for 2 - 5 players , but the more players there are , the more challenging it becomes because everyone is competing for areas on the map.There are cards you get that require you to connect your trains to 2 cities . You have to keep at least one in the beginning of the game , but can draw more later on . These become important for getting a lot of points . However , not connecting your trains between those cities means you lose points.It is a highly strategic game and players can cut off other players from continuing on their path , and with several players , the board gets crowded , making it a challenge to connect your cities , which is a lot of fun ! My family thoroughly enjoys this game . It is good for both families with children as well as adults .	1
Originally posted at [ ... ] , a new idea everyday ! Game- Ticket to RideProducer-Days of WonderPrice- $ 35-45TL ; DR- Theme does n't stop this train ! 92.5 % Basics- Around America in seven days ! In Ticket to Ride , you play one of five different friends who are obsessed with Phileas Fogg , the man who went around the world in 80 days . Based on Fogg 's story , the players make a one million dollar bet to see who can make it to the most cities in seven days . In the game , players can do one of three different things on their turn to travel across America : collect tickets , collect routes , or spend tickets to travel . When a player collects tickets , they draw one or two tickets . These tickets can be one of five revealed tickets or from the draw pile . If a player draws a wild card from the revealed tickets that is the only ticket they can draw that turn . When a player collects routes , they draw three routes and must keep one . Routes are worth positive points if a player has connected the cities on the card at the end of the game , but , the card could be worth negative points if the player does not complete the route . The last action a player can do is spending tickets to place trains on the board . To place trains on a path on the board , a player must spend enough tickets of the same color as the path . Some paths are gray and allow the player to spend any color ticket as long as they spend the same color tickets . Each time a player places trains on the board , they earn points based on how long the path is . Play continues until one player has two or less trains in reserve . Then all players get one last turn , and then the game is over . After counting points from route cards the player with the most points wins ! Theme-I 'll be honest . I 've played this game a lot , but , I did n't read the story until I finally bought the game . The story reinforces the theme decently and helps makes the title `` Ticket to Ride '' make sense . Some of the mechanics do n't quite reinforce the theme as once you have a route it does n't leave the board . Do you get to keep the tickets you have for that route in the game ? Do you get to keep riding the trains for free ? Why ca n't other players ride the same train as me ? It 's not perfect , but I do feel like I 'm busy trying to make it across America as fast as I can . 3.5/5Mechanics-Ticket to Ride has some of the slickest mechanics out there . My simple summary above is almost all the rules you need to play the game . The game is quick , fun , and family friendly for almost all ages . Even though the game does n't have the insane depth of some other games , a surprising amount of strategy emerges in this game . Since goals are secrete , you never know when your best laid plans will go up in smoke . That tension is amazing for a simple game . 5/5Instructions-The instructions are four pages . Not four pages front and back , two pages front and back . Since the rules are not complex , the rules do n't need an epic to teach the players . I do like the art and pictures that help to teach how to play . Brevity is the height of wit with these rules . 5/5Execution-The box is nice and hardy . The path indicators are cute plastic trains that are a nice addition to the game . The board has a nice layout and is easy to read . AND , I know the Days of Wonder LOVES me since the game comes with plastic bags for each player 's components . I absolutely love when a company does that ! 5/5Summary-I love this game . It 's quick , family friendly , and always good to see making it to the table . The theme is slightly off , but the mechanics , instructions , and execution of the game make up for that hands down . Really worth trying if you get the chance . 92.5 %	1
I recently wrote a review for the Forbidden Island board game . In it , I said that I have been playing board games for a very long time and it is getting harder to find games that I can say are actually better than most of the games I have played before . Forbidden Island was one of them that I would say that about and so is Ticket To Ride . Like Forbidden Island , Ticket To Ride is very easy to learn and to teach how to play . It will appeal to players of all ages . You play as the owner of a railroad line and you are trying to fulfill contracts by placing trains on routes that connect cities all over a map of the United States . The more contracts you can fulfill , the more victory points you can accumulate . There are a lot of expansion sets released , with lots of new maps from all over the world and many more ways to play . Ticket To Ride is a must have for any board game collection .	1
This is another one of those games that is a fairly simple concept and rule set , but provides a challenge every time and never seems to get old . It is currently our family favorite .	1
As noted in many of my other relevant game reviews , I 'm I am always looking for games I can play with my fiance . She is what some would call a & # 34 ; reluctant gamer & # 34 ; whereas I am an avid gamer , so I have be careful about what games I introduce her to . She prefers games that rely at least a little on luck ( i.e. , not all strategy ) and are n't too complex ( i.e. , where you can learn/remember the mechanic after a game or two ) , whereas I love strategy and complexity but do n't mind a little luck . We also like games you can finish in a single session ( or games you can play multiple times in a single session ) .TTR is fun to play and easy to learn ( in fact , the USA version is the simplest of the TTR franchise ) . The 1910 expansion is a must ( updates some old components , and adds some new ones that are really worthwhile ) . The luck component is based on the train cards and destination tickets you randomly draw . The strategy component is based on what routes you try to complete , some of the card choices you make ( they do not always have to be random ) , etc.We liked the game so much that I eventually bought all four of the map collections ( Asia , India & Switzerland , Africa , & Neederlands ) . We do n't own but have also played Nordic Countries , too.The only reasons I 'm giving it 4 rather than 5 stars are ( 1 ) the 1910 expansion is so essential that it really should have been included in the base game , and ( 2 ) once you 've played this version a few times this particular map will start to feel a little simple . Knowing what I know now I probably would have started with the Europe map and 1912 expansion instead ( a little more to it at first , but lots more ways to grow into the game ) . But , this is still a great way to learn the game , and if you happen to be from the U.S. it will be a little easier to find the cities since you 'll know where everything is .	1
I love this game , it 's a great intro to euro-style board games . It 's easy enough to understand , but it 's complex and deep enough to satisfy the adults as well .	1
There are n't enough adjectives to describe how much fun this game is to play . The instructions & rules are straightforward and the quality of the game pieces is very high.Pros : Provides great entertainment value for all ages.Anywhere from 2-5 players can play.Takes only 30 minutes to 1 hour to complete a game.Plenty of strategies to use to win the game.Educational , especially for children.Learn a lot about US & Canadian geography.Cons : Very addicting.This is one of the most interesting games that I 've ever played . What makes it especially fun is that it can be played by fairly young children , right through older adults . While the game is pretty simple to play ; the strategies involved can become quite interesting . The game offers thrills and excitement and one becomes more adept as time goes by . Another great aspect is the fact that it 's very difficult to become bored ; you can play for hours on end and never lose interest . The game is very educational , as it requires a player to visualize how to route your trains and it teaches a great deal about US and Canadian geography . I ca n't think of a game in recent memory that offers so much for both children and adults alike . This one 's a winner .	1
Ticket to Ride is amazing . It is simple enough that my 6 year old daughter can play , but has complex layers that make it fun for me . It is a game for the whole family that we can play again and again . Choose your tickets ( destinations ) and build your train route between the locations , but watch out , others can block your path making you take a longer route . This game has tons of replay value and is a great game for the whole family !	1
Great game , lots of fun . I even simplified the rules and had my 4 year old playing . Really a lot of fun even with some novice game players	1
We love this game . My 6 , 8 , and 10 year olds enjoy . Its fun enough that I never mind playing with them . Its easy to learn . It also has a very nice box with each game piece having a place . This makes for organized storage and game set up . Huge plus for this house full of toys .	1
What a fun game ! Got it for my grandkids but my adult sons also loved it . The whole family joined in on an evening of fun . Probably for age 8 and up . Each player draws cards for their destinations and then chooses other cards for the appropriate paths to the destination . Points are earned for the various trips and moves . Lots of pieces ( trains ) are needed to play and ca n't be lost so I marked it a little down on durability . Good for learning maps , math , and making choices . The older ones used strategies to block each other but the younger ones were content with making it to the right city . Everyone kept very attentive and wanted to play again and again .	1
Do n't be deceived by the somewhat disturbing characters that are depicted on the game 's box art . This is quite possibly the best board game you will ever play ( other than Ticket To Ride Europe , which is even better , having benefited from all the years of playtesting that the original got in the hands of the public ) . It 's quick to learn , fun to play ( even with only two players ) , and has infinite replay value . You can add even more replay value by adding the 1910 expansion , and/or the Alvin and Dexter expansion down the road.The quality of the components is very good ( certainly not the best out there , but durable and well built ) . My only minor complaint is that the cards are way too tiny , but if this is an issue for you , it can be rectified by adding the 1910 expansion , which features replacements for all the original cards , plus new destination tickets.Believe the hype on this one ... I was skeptical , but so glad I gave it a try . We are now huge fans of the Ticket to Ride series , and we own Europe , Africa , and the original , all of which are super fun to play , and they only take about an hour to complete , making it perfect for any evening .	1
A fantastic game that I can play over and over again with my friends . It 's quite easy to learn and can be fun/frustrating messing with your friends routes .	1
I , like many others , first heard of this via the Xbox Arcade version of it . The game itself is a great balance of simple rules with rich gameplay potential.It 's an attractive game ( lot 's of little pieces though ! ) that draws people to it . Good for getting people who do n't like other German board games ( Catan , Carcassone ) to play . Can also play a reasonable game with only 2 people , although 3-5 is ideal.The only difficult thing is the cards . They are tiny little things , and the game uses a LOT of cards and demands reshuffling them frequently ( the discard pile ends up with groups of like cards ) . This is difficult to do due to the size of the cards . I believe there is an add-on ( 1910 ? ) that contains bigger cards .	1
This is a fun game for players of all ages . The board depicts a map of the United States ( in this version ; other versions exist for other locations ) with train routes of appropriate lengths between major cities . Players have tickets from one major city to another . In order to get credit for that ticket , the player must build their train between those cities . Combine routes to get points for more tickets.The game requires logic in that you need to plan your route appropriately ; longer legs earn greater point values.A good time is had by all !	1
This game is a hit with my entire family ! I 've never bought a game that has been requested as many times as this one . The board is very attractive and the rules are very easy to understand . On the downside , the cards that come with the game are ridiculously small , which makes them extremely hard to shuffle . However , the expansion pack has regular sized cards , and though it feels like some kind of extortion , I believe it is worth the extra money to simply buy the expansion pack sooner rather than later . Additionally , the trains are small and easily lost , so be careful while playing with little kids . Otherwise , I have no complaints . This game is easy to understand , fun to play , and fantastically frustrating when playing with more than one other person . To give a comparison , it 's like a simpler and quicker Monopoly , which means it 's well on its way to becoming a classic in my opinion.Overall : The cards and train cars aside , this game still rocks ! If you think you 'd enjoy something like I 've described , then go for it ! You wo n't regret purchasing a game that 's as fun and award winning as this one .	1
This game is easy to learn and is a fun game especially if you like trains as we do . A game of strategy and teaches children to learn to think ahead .	1
This game was recommended to me by my adult son . It is a lot of fun for everyone when we get together on the holidays . They also make an additional version that involves European train travel that is on my & # 34 ; to buy & # 34 ; list for next summer . It is an enjoyable way to enjoy an evening or a rainy afternoon . It would be a bit complicated for younger children , but they could partner with a big person and older kids would enjoy it .	1
I got this for Christmas , and what a fun game . We played with a variety of people and age levels , and everyone seemed to enjoy it . It is n't complicated , so even if you have younger people ( or a lot older , for that matter ) , they 'll be able to play with you . The game also takes a reasonable amount of time , meaning that it is n't very lengthy like Settlers or even Monopoly tends to be . You should be able to get a few rounds in during a game night with friends .	1
This is an excellent game for 2-5 players , and especially for kids . I was initially put off by the theme and the mentioning of winning the $ 1 million dollar prize on the advertisement . I immediately thought there would be paper money involved and it would be like Monopoly where I would have to be a banker , , , and yech . But no , I was WRONG . There is no fake money involved ! Just little cards with different colors . Easy , but challenging . It is a game where you can be nice and not mess with your opponents supposed destination , or you can try and block them . You get points according to the tracks you lay and connections you make.But please , I love Amazon , but their Days of Wonder games are all overpriced . You can get this and their other games much cheaper on designated game sites . Do a search , read other reviews , boardgamegeek is a wonderful place to look and compare games . This was one of the first games I bought and I just keep finding more neat games to buy that you ca n't find here . ***Fast forward 2010*** This is still a great game , that has n't changed . Just want to note that Amazon does have better pricing on this and other games now , especially when free shipping is involved .	1
Like this game ! So much easier to play than the Asian and European versions . Have enjoyed this with our friends .	1
Ticket to Ride is a really easy and simple game to pick up and learn , but if you do n't have any of the expansions to add more complexity , it 's almost to simple for its own good as the replay value is greatly diminished , but I still like to pull it out and play it every once in awhile .	1
We got this for our family for Christmas and it was great . The game has a similar feel to Settlers , but is n't quite as cut-throat , so it 's easier to get through a game without people feeling frustrated at each other . I can see why this game has won so many awards . I also love that it comes with three extra train pieces of each color so to account for pieces ever getting lost . The only thing we did n't like was that all the cards are very small ( about 2 1/2 & # 34 ; tall ) making it very hard to shuffle them ) .	1
My wife and kids bought this game for me for my birthday . We played 2 games and my 10 year old daughter keep wanting to play again . It is a great game where everyone has a chance and it a lot of fun to play.But do n't just believe me - Watch it being played [ ... ]	1
So much fun . We have bought this game for ourselves and everyone in our family . So much fun . Only 5 players can play .	1
Players start the game by drawing cards which give them train routes across the US they should aim to create . During the game , they create train routes , earning points for each segment created , plus bonus points for completing a designated route . It 's a strategy game with a dose of luck . But compared to Ticket to Ride Europe , it is less cutthroat , and harder to thwart other players . The game is fairly predictable , but fun and appropriate for both adults and children , groups of up to five as well as two players . It 's also good for those who want exposure to U.S. geography . A fun , well-made game . Recommended .	1
There is a reason that & # 34 ; Ticket to Ride & # 34 ; has sold over 2 million copies and has won numerous awards in several countries . I had not even heard of this board game until recently but after receiving it from Amazon last week our whole family became addicted and we have played it almost every day . It 's simple enough so that young children can learn it but has enough strategy that there are entire web sites dedicated to playing it more thoughtfully . It really is a great game.The only negative aspect is the high cost . I bought it from Amazon and that was still expensive . Ebay and others want between $ 40- $ 50 for it . It 's just a board , cards , and plastic pieces - no justification for the price . If you can get past that - there are no other downsides . I 'm glad we bought it .	1
Ticket to Ride is a game my family and I have been able to play over and over and over again . It 's one of the best new games I 've played in years . I have the game , expansions and even the iPad version . The classic physical board game is still my favorite with friends , but the digital version allows you to play against an AI pretty easily with no change in gameplay.If you know a computer scientist , math major or engineer , they will find the mathematical puzzle of solving the & # 34 ; Shortest Path & # 34 ; problem fascinating.A great gift for a friend or your family .	1
I 've had this game for a few years now , and I must say this is one of the best board games I 've ever played . I 've introduced several people to this game , including family members that do n't like board games , and everyone has loved it . The game goes by quickly , with a full session taking about 45-60 minutes . Each player 's turn goes by quickly as well , averaging about 10 seconds for two of the normal actions ( drawing train cards or claiming a route ) , and maybe 1 minute for the other action ( choosing new destination cards -- a somewhat uncommon event ) , so you do n't end up in a situation when each player is taking forever to play.The game also tends to be fairly light hearted . No one knows where anyone else is going , so no one can specifically choose to try to block a specific person ( likewise , that never seems to be an optimal move anyway ) . No one 's feeling should get hurt by the time the game has finished.The overall quality of the peices of the game are also quite good . The board is very nice ( but large ) , the train peices are a light plastic that holds up ( but try not to step on them ) , and the cards are pretty durable . The box also holds all of the pieces quite neatly , so you do n't need to fumble around the box trying to find whatever piece you now need.I would definately recommend this game to anyone interested in the least . You wo n't be disapointed .	1
This is a fun game and with the Untied States version , a great way to learn a little geography of the country . It 's good for different ages .	1
An awesome game that the whole family can enjoy ! Extremely well made with a concept that is easy to learn but hard to master ! !	1
Awesome game . I 'm currently addicted to the online version of this game , but I 've played the real thing as well . It 's a great game for 2-5 people . Honestly , I think it 's more fun if you have 3-5 players because there 's more potential for your planned routes to be disrupted . When you play a computer , it 's not really out to get you , I do n't think ... people , however , are often out to get you . You know your true friends when they relish the thought of purposefully foiling your perfect train route.I like that it 's a relatively quick game with a definite end . Some games ( like monopoly ) are great but there 's the potential for it to run very , very long . When this game promises to be done in about an hour , it carries out that promise . Lots of replay value here because there are numerous routes . At the same time , it 's an easy game to learn , so you can teach a new bunch of people how to play in just a few minutes.The slight downside is that it 's only for 5 players . We 've played with 6 before by doubling up , but it 's not exactly conducive to huge gatherings.Have fun .	1
My husband and I enjoy board games and would definitely recommend this game . It 's can be very challenging and after you play it a few times you 'll begin to develop a strategy . Lots of fun !	1
This game is easy to learn and quickly fun , but we did n't stay into it very long and do n't see us playing it long term . I can see this forgotten within a year unfortunately.We enjoy a game where there is some amount of conversation after the game about the strategies used and reasons for some decisions . We do n't find ourselves doing that much.We like it for from 2 to 4 players , thinking 5 is too many . The game does change quite a bit with different numbers of players , which is nice ( variety ) .We think it has the right mix of luck and skill . It can initially seem too luck based ( draw bad cards ) , but you realize there are strategies to deal with that.Quick to set up and put away , and well made . Quick to play ( less than an hour ) .I suspect people who find Settlers of Catan and Dominion fun but too involved might like this.The on-line version is great because it is so convenient . It shows you the cities you need to connect which is really handy . It is I think $ 10 per person for a life-time account . When it 's just my husband and I we prefer to sit with our laptops and play that way.ALSO - you can try it before you buy it that way . You can make an account for free and play 5 games .	1
So I found this while I was searching for Rail Baron , an awesome train game that is no longer being made and no longer cheap to find used . Rail Baron was like a cross between this and Monopoly , but there are no dollars involved with this game . I 'm impressed with the quality of the cards and board overall , it 's built to last . On the educational side , kids can learn geography of major cities in North America , and how to pronounce Sault St. Marie ( it 's not `` salt '' ) . But enough about that , this game is loads of fun , easy to learn , and does n't take all day to setup or play a full game . The only downside I see with this is that it 's only a five player game . If this were six-player , it would be even more awesome , and I 'm not sure if the expansion enables additional players . Ultimately , I this game is a healthy and financially satisfying alternative to Rail Baron ... and even better if you do n't want the fake money alternative .	1
We have introduced this game to others and they thoroughly enjoy it . the train routes are always different for each person . You really do n't know who is going to win the game until the very end .	1
If you 've ever been on Boardgamegeek.com or seen bloggers , reviewers , or anyone talking about Boardgames over the past few years , you 've probably seen this mentioned . There is a good reason for that . This game is FUN ! Very easy to learn , looks beautiful , plays in about an hour . What more could you ask for ? I 've taught many people to play it , and not one person has n't enjoyed this game . Buy it !	1
I needed that route ! You just cut me off , now instead of destination cards giving me gobs of points , now they all count against me . There & # 8217 ; s no way around ! My nerves have never felt more vexed than they do now . That & # 8217 ; s Jane Austin speak for : I & # 8217 ; m seeing red and now I & # 8217 ; m going to do anything I think might hurt your chances for the rest of the game ; and the next one we play ! Ok , so the first time this happens , there & # 8217 ; s usually another way around , it & # 8217 ; s probably the long way around , but hopefully you have enough trains to make it , because that & # 8217 ; s a constraint you have to work under.Game PlayThis handsomely illustrated elongated board looks has a map of the United States dotted with notable cities that are connected by short and long lines of rectangles ( or tracks ) . In line of track is one of several colors.You start the game with some cards in your hand that are nicely illustrated train cars of the same several colors . Each turn you either take you can draw two cards from either some face up cards or & # 8220 ; roll the dice & # 8221 ; and choose some from a facedown draw pile , or a combination . If you pick a wild from the face-up pile , you only get one card that turn . buy a route ( lay down your trains on the rectangles between cities ) You buy the track by discarding from your hand the same number and color of cards of the track where you lay down your trains . Draw three Destination Cards . You & # 8217 ; ve got to keep at least one . These give a method to the madness of which routes you buy.As you lay down your trains you rack up points , The longer the track , the larger the gain . If you successfully complete the route on your destination card , you also rack up points , but those you conceal till the end of the game.The game ends a full round after someone has fewer than four trains- everyone but the catalyst gets another turn.Points are scored as I & # 8217 ; ve said , but those destinations you weren & # 8217 ; t able to complete , yeah those count as negative points . Oooo.. ouch.I hate to tell you what to do but & # 8230 ; Keep an eye on how many trains your opponents have left , don & # 8217 ; t be stupid and fill your hand with destinations when you won & # 8217 ; t have time to complete them.If it looks like a route you need is one that your opponent might need , you have a vested interest in getting there first , even if it & # 8217 ; s an easy one.You may even consider drawing more destination cards for your first turn or two so that you can spend more time in the game working on more that are related . Than getting those you start with and drawing more in the middle of the game.What does & # 8220 ; related & # 8221 ; mean ? Consider the following routes : LA to Miami ( goes from the south-east corner of the US to the south-west corner ) New Orleans to Duluth ( goes north and south through the center of the US ) Salt Lake City to Houston ( goes from the western US to the south-center ) Because there could easily be much overlap in the first and third route , but not the second route , I & # 8217 ; d dump the second route and keep the other two.ThemeWell , several off-shoots from Ticket to Ride have come . Not to mention an expansions for the original game that adds several smaller routes . So there is evidence that the theme can be slanted , but in Ticket To Ride Europe , game play is the same with some twists , like you can use someone else & # 8217 ; s route for your destination & # 8217 ; s sake without getting points for the route , and you route requiring tunneling through mountains are more pricey . These off-shoot stand alone games are a good way for Days of Wonder to charge full price for what could have been a less expensive expansion to the existing game.I can hear you say , & # 8220 ; Yeah , but they are boards in different venues ! & # 8221 ; Yes , they are , but Rio Grande seemed to be able to offer double-sided boards ( Yes , that means two new maps ) and new rule sets for Power Grid for less than half the cost of the original game. & # 8220 ; Oh ... Really ? & # 8221 ; Yup . But for comments to the theme itself , I think the original game is pretty strong . Struggling to eek out routes to complete destinations- trying to get there before someone cuts you off can be very nerve racking , especially when two or more destination cards are riding on making that connection . I & # 8217 ; ve got lots of little trains ! Cool little plastic trains ! BalanceWhile I often complain about chance and this game includes card , the fact that you don & # 8217 ; t have to take all the destination cards you draw mitigates it , and that there are several face up cards to choose from also helps . Anyone can build anywhere beats the imbalance Power Grid shackles you with . Tit for tat . Anyway , for having cards , I have no complaints.InteractionInteraction is low . While verbal congrats are possible , expressions of dismay and indifference often follow someone laying track . If you can & # 8217 ; t reach the cards , there will be- & # 8220 ; give me those two oranges & # 8221 ; or , & # 8220 ; how about two off the mystery pile of joy ! But as I think of it , this game could be played in silence . So if you are entertaining that favorite group of mine to pick on- introverts , you already knew what you were in for.Learning CurveLow . The purchase price card you get tells you how much things cost and the production of a square base on die roll and Robber operation are pretty easy . Each development cards has what it does written plainly on it . While the rules are easy , the options are pretty limited and objective is pretty straightforward.DowntimeNominal . While you do have to wait your turn , there is a possibility that the track you want to buy gets bought on someone else & # 8217 ; s turn . If you pay attention you can make groans at the time they will pay off the most.What & # 8217 ; s not to Like ? I can & # 8217 ; t think of anything bad to say that I haven & # 8217 ; t already said . It & # 8217 ; s a great game that has done much good for the industry and I trust the makers are raking in mega bucks with all their spin offs . If people are willing to pay , they deserve it . Ah , the beauty of capitalism . I guess there are eccentric people out there , who are happy to shell out another $ 35 to $ 50.Collateral EndorsementI haven & # 8217 ; t come across a soul who didn & # 8217 ; t like this game , but you may say that my social circles are small . You are probably right , but I love growing them with games . My kids love to line up the trains from here to there , but they have severed my board in one place , so beware , the ( read : any ) board is best set up on a table rather than the carpet floor where wee feet are wont to walk .	1
This is a great game , lots of fun for many different ages . Get the family together and have some fun !	1
Love this game ! My family is huge game people and we love this game ! It can be played with two people which is nice for just my husband and I to play . My ten year old niece can even play the game .	1
I absolutely love this game.. it is by far our first pick when choosing a game to play . The only thing is I highly recommend getting the expansion card pack ... it makes it much easier and more fun to play.It 's easy to learn and once you have learned it the game goes fairly quick . My only complaint is that some of the capitals are in the wrong spot on the map : )	1
This is probably the best game to get non-gamers into Board Games . It is so easily to pick up and learn the rules , while strategic enough that expert gamers enjoy playing as well . This is my wife 's favorite game and we have bought all of the expansions . This is a reoccurring game on our regular game nights.I will add that , it is great that this game can also be played very well with only 2 players .	1
I enjoy this game so much , that I purchased the iPad app of it as well , and play on my subway commute to and from work !	1
My son is a game designer and buys games for us to play . This is one of my favorites -- I 've even won a few times over my sons who are both smarter than me . As an educator , I think it 's a fun way to learn geography . We love playing it over the holidays . It 's not too easy and not too difficult . 2 to 4 of us have played it and enjoyed it equally . I see this Christmas my son is asking for the 1910 version , as it 's on his wish list . I want to try the Europe extension so will ask for that . This is a quality game that everyone should enjoy .	1
Fun for all ages ! Gives a good opportunity to try thinking and planning ahead , and teaches geography in an enjoyable way !	1
We play this with our 7 year old , and we all love it ! : ) Fun for adults , not just families .	1
Great game ! Our 7 year old can play with only a little help . We are glad we got it , it will be even more fun when our kids are a bit older .	1
A classic tabletop game , simple to learn with tons of replay value . But the cards , ugh I did n't even open mine I just ordered the 1910 expansion and used those because my fat fingers can not deal with those tiny cards . I guess it can help the game fit on a table better but really blah !	1
Awesome game for friends and family get togethers . It is just one of those good wholesome games that make you think the entire way through it plotting your technique as well as how to possibly screw your opponent . Hours of endless fun and gaming ! ! ! I would give it more stars but 5 stars is the limit !	1
Is a great game that adults and kids can play together ! ! It takes more than two hours to finish a game	1
Ticket to Ride is an easy to learn game for 2 to 5 players . Three or more is ideal . Each player draws three tickets and has to choose which routes to fill . You may keep one route , or all three . Each route has a different value depending on how difficult or long the route may be to complete . You draw train car cards of different colors and try to save up to & # 34 ; buy & # 34 ; your route . The person who gets the most points at the end wins . Very easy to play . It is my 9 year old 's favorite game . We love it so much , we just ordered Ticket to Ride Europe .	1
We enjoy playing this game as a family . It is quite fun and can be a learning experience as well . I highly recommend this . It is also a plus when you can use it as family time around the table . You will be surprised what you can learn about your own children just by playing a game with them .	1
My wife will actually play this game with me ! It 's not really for just 2 people , since there is n't a whole lot of competition to get the tracks you want , but it 's still a good time , I 've heard of playing a third person between the two of you , for extra competition/fun , but we have yet to do it , it 's fine with just the 2 of us .	1
Got this game for my birthday last year . I love it . Also got the addition Alvin and Dexter for it . Basically the game is a map of the USA with train routes connecting cities . You draw train routes ( Omaha to Seattle , for example ) and try to collect enough colored cards matching the color of the tracks . Usually , but not always , there are a few ways to get to your destinations which is a good thing since other players can block your progress . Nobody knows the routes you have and you can play anywhere you want even if you do n't have any trip tickets for a route . We play this game at least once a week and everybody loves it . You can win a game on your second try . It does n't take alot of extra learning to get better . Obviously you gain some experience playing more but that does n't necessarily mean you will win . I gave it 4 stars because the cards that come with it are miniature . Do n't know why they do this . I bought ( maybe that is why they do it ) an addition , 1910 which replaces the Trip tickets and train cards with normal sized cards . As mentioned above , I also got the Alvin and Dexter addition wehich adds some chaos to the game , which I love . That addition has to little non-discript chararcters which I detailed painted to make them look better . Some people love that addition others find it too stressful . I love it . Bottom line is Ticket to Ride is a great game and will be played for many years . Worth getting even with the little cards .	1
I 'm so happy when I find games that require some concentration , thinking , and is not too complicated . This is a fun game for the entire family ( our youngest plays it without using the & # 34 ; Destination & # 34 ; cards ) . This game is really just a fair , fun play that anyone can catch onto.I really like the quality of the board , the style of the cards , and that it actually all fits into the box for easy clean up ! It would 've been nicer if they used wooden instead of plastic for the train pieces . But still a great game ! !	1
We love this game too . The replay on it is high and the strategy is easy once you play a couple times . I just wish this version had more routes . We have bought India and Switzerland s an expansion , but holding off on buying TTR Europe because I can not justify spending so much on yet another version that is almost exactly the same s this one .	1
We just received this game at Christmas . Only played it once and we modified the rules a bit to get started because the kids were getting impatient with us adults trying to 'learn ' it . Our daughters are ages 7 & 9 , I think once we play a few more times it will become easier and we will learn more about the strategy , but even the first game was fun , even though a bit involved to get moving in the beginning and never having played before .	1
Something about this game really draws me in ! I could play this game every night and never lose interest . Every game is different . Every game takes skill and strategy and not just luck . Part of what I like about this game is the quality of the design . The instructions , the inserts , on down to the box it comes in are beautiful . When I 'm playing the game it makes me feel like I 'm actually building real-life train tracks ... this is probably aided by the introduction to the game where it tells about rich old friends meeting once each year and betting on who could get to a certain destination cheapest and fastest ... or something like that . I would recommend this game to anyone . It 's challenging , pretty , and fun .	1
Everyone loves to play this . Great family game while learning a bot of geography as a bonus . wish they made the cards big again.. this comes with the tiny cards .	1
Great game . Really highlights the idea of simplicity and fun . Sure there are more complicated board games around , but this one you can pick up in 30 minutes and teach to an 8 year old . By the end of the hour , you will feel like you are racing to build your train route across the United States while competing with your opponent . There 's a reason this game is so good . Children love it , Adults love and you will too . Not sure about all the others , but this is the one that started it all .	1
out of all the games that I purchased this is the one that I enjoyed the most . I can play it with my nieces and nephew , and know they will have fun .	1
There are already tons of reviews of this game . None of the reviews are less than three stars , so that should already speak volumes about it . I really ca n't think of anything new to add that has n't already been said . I and my game group play this regularly and have n't tired of it . It is also a great game for people to get into the board gaming hobby .	1
My 8-year old loves this game . It is the perfect game to introduce him to more difficult ones . If you need extra help with the instructions , search on youtube , where you can find some guides on how to play . Have fun !	1
Ihad my doubts at first . Let 's face it , when someone says & # 34 ; Let 's play monopoly , & # 34 ; the first thing you think of is Oh no ! a long boring game . Well , that was my first impression when my husband suggested buying the game . Totally changed my mind from the very first time we played the game . We have family night and couples night with this game . It is fun and worth the investment . I know it 's a little on the higher end of cost but it is lots of fun .	1
Such a fun game . A mix of luck and strategy is needed to pull ahead and build the most routes , or the longest routes , across the map of the U.S . I 've played it several times with strangers at Phoenix Comicon , and it never fails to entertain.This is one of those games that you can play with adults and with kids that can pick up relatively easy games . I play with my 8 and 10 year olds , and they have fun with it.This is one of those games that you can see in action on the Geek & Sundry show , TableTop ( on YouTube ) . I highly recommend watching that episode and all the others .	1
Why do all the best board games originate from Europe ? I read about this game on an on-line game site , highlighting some of the best family board games out there , and this is one that made the list . It looked fun and easy-to-learn , so I picked it up in time for the holidays . I had a lot of fun playing this with my family over Thanksgiving and Christmas get-togethers . The game is simple to learn , simple to play , and is really pretty casual . There 's a small amount of luck and strategy involved , but most people can play this on an even footing and it is not geared towards competitive game-play . More fun with the full five players on the board , it can still be finished in about 1 hour of play . I highly recommend trying this game out !	1
raved about it ! It looked like a good game for the family , so I got it for a Christmas present . I think the kids have gotten to play it once or twice , but the adults in the family invite friends over for game night and this is the game of choice.It 's been fun watching my niece and husband invite her brother and fiance over to play this game . They went out and bought one of the other & # 34 ; Ticket to Ride & # 34 ; games as well.It 's a keeper and definitely worth the money . A GREAT break from TV !	1
Oh my Gosh ! We love this game ! This is a fast game to learn and does n't take hours to play . We have spent many fun hours playing this game together and we have loaned it out to friends as well . I recently just bought it for my married daughter for Christmas and she loves it also !	1
I ca n't really top any of the other excellent reviews for this game . However , I 'd like to toss my hat into the ring and recommend the Ticket to Ride series to anyone looking for a well designed family game to beat the usual crowd ( Monopoly , etc ) . It 's fun , replayable , rewards experienced players , but has some luck to make it interesting . TTR even masks some fine educational merits in a pretty package ... geography , math , tactical and strategic thinking .	1
My seven year old has ADHD so we are always playing boards games as I try to limit electronics as much as I can . This was a big hit with him . Holds his attention and is educational in learning the map . It is just me and him so it is also a big plus that it is fun for just two players . Some games just are n't good for just two but this is good for two .	1
We loved it ! So much so that we had to order the card game version . This is definitely a game everyone should have in their collection !	1
I think that Ticket to Ride is one of the best games out there . The idea of the game is to connect cities on the map using train cars that you collect . You start by receiving train route cards known as destination cards . There are certain colored tracks on the board that you have to play to begin connecting your train . If you connect your destinations with your trains , you earn the points for that card . You also receive points for each train you lay down . There is a bonus if you have the longest continuous train too.I love that this game is so easy for newbies to learn and yet it is challenging every time you play . There is some strategy for the analytical mind people out there , but not too much where others get bored . It is fun for all types of players . This is definitely a middle schooler to adult age range.I also love that there are expansion packs too so we can always choose a different version . I definitely like this complete set more than the Europe version . You have to buy a complete set before you can branch out into the expansion packs . I do like the 1910 USA expansion pack better with this original set . I like the destinations and variations more . The train cards in the 1910 USA are so much easier to use too . I would recommend buying them together.Our family owns the following Ticket to Ride games : USA original Complete Set , USA 1910 expansion , Europe original Compete Set , Asia expansion , and India/Switzerland expansion . Out of the expansion packs so far , most of us like the India/Switzerland set . You can see my review for more information .	1
Simple to learn but different every time you play . The single or double routes between cities is a great detail that makes it already customized to the number of players .	1
I was introduced to this game a few months ago at a family gathering . We are a family that likes to play a lot of games when we get together and this one was definitely the favorite . After playing it there - I went right home and had to buy it for myself.I really enjoy this game because it has a lot of different strategies that you can use , but is not so complicated that it 's exhausting . Even if you 're losing , it 's still SO fun to play and you really do n't know that you are losing until the end of the game anyway.I HIGHLY recommend this game ! ! ! We love to play it as a couple , as a family , and with all our friends that we can rope into it ! ! !	1
This is a great safe kid friendly family game . Our family has enjoyed playing this one . See who can take over the most tracks and win .	1
For anyone who is not a `` Gamer '' the name `` Ticket to Ride '' does n't really mean anything beyond a Beatles song . However if you mention it in Europe and many other parts of the world you might get a very different reaction.About a year ago I got interested in Board Games and after much research I found that Ticket to Ride was always mentioned as the Most Popular Game on all the gaming websites . They call it a `` Gateway Game '' , which means it is a Euro game that will appeal to non gamers , but at the same time it is a good enough game that gamers like to play it as well.I was still a bit hesitant to buy it as I am not a big `` Train '' person . But after reading many many reviews , I realized that this game must be something really good and I broke down and ordered it.I can tell you that anytime anyone wants to play Ticket to Ride now I am always ready to play . It does n't take long to learn how to play , but it is one of those games that you learn new stratgies as you play it.Ticket to Ride is usually my first choice now to introduce non gamers to Euro-style games . I have yet to meet anyone who did n't like playing Ticket to Ride.I think if a poll was taken throughout the world , Ticket to Ride would probably be # 1 even though it is not well known in the US . Once you play it you wo n't want to go back to playing Monopoly ... . there really is no comparison ... they are on two different levels.Do yourself a favor and get this game and see for yourself .	1
Good game play and a lot of fun.Player turns go pretty quickly with the exception of picking extra tickets , but that is not unexpected.Play it a few times to get a handle on the strategies , but that is not an issue since replayability is very good with this game . It is easy to teach and had been a hit with a variety of different people . I am always willing to play a game of Ticket to Ride .	1
Just bought the game and played it for the first time yesterday with 4 players . Good game to get the wives involved that that is n't too in depth in terms of multiple levels of strategy that scare away casual players . The destination tickets add the variety to keep it fresh each time so that it 's not always a race to get the 6 space routes . The lack of dice help to keep chance ( luck ) to a minimum other than the rail cards that you draw . Highly recommended .	1
Fun game for the whole family ! Takes a few rounds to play without having to think too hard . Enough detail to make playing often enjoyable . I have played this a few times with my husband and two sons ( 11 and 16 ) . We have made a habit of playing family games at least every couple of weeks . Often we will play a game every evening during holiday breaks from school . I am impressed by this game and hope to purchase other Days of Wonder games in the future . They are a bit pricey , but much better than you average board game .	1
I played this game first on iPad ( also a blast ) and recommended to a co-worker who came back the next day raving about how much he loved it . Since then I 've also played the actual board game and I ca n't say enough good things about this game . Pretty simple rules to get started , and once you do the fun never stops . Even in games I 've gotten clobbered , I still have a great time , and my girlfriend loves it too . This is one that you can play with your whole family and easily teach any guests you have to play . There are a lot of little train pieces that could get lost in a party but other than that minor concern , I ca n't imagine anyone not enjoying this wonderfully original , beautifully presented game . All the praise is deserved .	1
Ticket to Ride ( TtR ) is a great game for people who are n't really that experienced in the board gaming world . Most of us Americans grew up with a bunch of famous named games ( Monopoly , Risk , Life , etc ) but often these games leave much to be desired because they are either : long , tedious , or too dependent on luck . Lucky for us , over the last 15-20 years game manufacturers both here in the US and in Europe are pushing games to our market and the popularity and success is too much to ignore . Days of Wonder has created a Euro-Style board game in TtR but have removed a lot of the more bulky rules that deter most people from wanting to play new board games.The basic idea in this game is to pickup resources to build trains on a large map of the US and connect as many cities as you can . You have pre-determined routes to achieve by connecting certain cities to one another . The trick and skill to this game is maximizing your network of tracks and connecting as many cities as possible ... while keeping a continuous train . The reason this game is so great is that you have a lot of activity at all times ( picking up resources , connecting cities by placing trains on the board , picking up new routes/goals , etc. ) . The other nice feature to this game and most Euro-games is that players are never fully eliminated . Although someone might be far from winning , they are still in the game and can play a part . The final part of this game which is so much fun is that once the final turn has been triggered , there is a big reveal of sorts where everyone shows their secret routes they were trying to achieve and gain points ( or lose them ! ) based on their success . The game can have many twists in turns in the final scoring.Great game for all ages . Fun for gamers and non-gamers alike . Play time is around 45 minutes ( longer for new players , obviously ) . This game plays 2-5 players .	1
Our whole family loves this game ( age 7 and up ) . We also own the Ticket to Ride Europe version , which has some other neat strategies . This is well worth the purchase and makes a good game to play with friends because the rules are easy to explain quickly . I highly recommend .	1
Incredible game for almost any age group . This board game has everything going for it . It is a great deal of fun , as each new game requires a different strategy from the last . The overall strategy tendencies are difficult to master , and after having played this game 50 times or more , I am still trying to decide the best strategic approach . It is very easy to learn , and after one play through you will never need to look at the rules again . The game is expertly constructed using materials that will not break or wear at any time in the near future . I plan to realistically have played this game thousands of times before any pieces need fixed/replaced . A group of my friends have a movie/game night once every week , and this seems to be the one game that everyone is always in the mood for.Overall , a great value for the price . Great gameplay , and loads of fun ! Fun for gamers and non-gamers , as I have not found anyone that dislikes this game .	1
My husband and I enjoy playing board games with friends and have found that this is a great game to teach beginner/intermediate players . It does have a good amount of strategy , but the rules are more simple than some other strategy game so it is easy to get the hang of it the first time you play .	1
Great family strategy game that play differently each time and does n't take up the entire evening . Play time is about 45 minutes . It continues to get a lot of play in my family	1
When we first opened the box , we were all a touch worried that this might be a complex game to play.Thankfully , we found this to completely not be the case.Ticket to Ride is a fun game where 2-5 players pick up cards and attempt to create the longest routes and between cities . Scoring takes more than just the longest route into consideration ( though that is the biggest factor ) .Having played this game at least 15 times from start to finish with 4 people , the average time it took us to play was roughly 40 minutes . Assuming you are OK with this , Ticket to Ride is a lot of fun and easily replayable.5 stars without question .	1
The game arrived quickly in perfect ( new ) condition.Ticket to Ride is a great game for the casual or the serious gamer . It is very simple to learn , but play can be quite complex due to competitive elements . It has a great light feel such that you can still have a conversation while playing without feeling you have to concentrate overly much on the game . That said , if you want to concentrate and strategize , there is still plenty of that to be done . This game is ideal for a board-gamer like me : a serious gamer who mostly plays with casual gamers , since it appeals to both.Overall , it is very fun and has great replay-ability . Good buy ; I would buy it again !	1
Ticket to ride is a great game with excellent game mechanics . In each turn you can do one of three things : get train cards , get destination tickets , or claim a route . As a result , the turns are rapid-paced which helps to keep players engaged . Sometimes I will finish my turn and go to get a glass of water only to find that the other players have taking their turns and are waiting on me.The game has a couple of shortcomings that keep it from being rated as 5-stars . The playing cards are smaller than standard playing cards , which is a bit of a pain considering the amount of shuffling you need to do in the game . There is also a small number of destination tickets . However , both of these shortcomings can be overcome with the USA 1910 expansion packDays of Wonder Ticket to Ride 1910 Expansionwhich has standard sized cards and more than 2x the destination tickets . I view this expansion as necessary for the game.This is a very fun game . However , if you are on the fence between Ticket to Ride and Ticket to Ride : EuropeTicket to Ride Europe , I would go with the Europe version . It adds a couple new rules/features that really enhance the gameplay , namely ferries ( where a locomotive/wild card is needed to complete a route , tunnels ( where there is the element of chance that you may need up to 3 extra cards to complete the route -- after all tunnels do sometimes have construction delays ) , and train stations ( where you can lose points to build them , but you can count and opponent 's route to help you finish a destination ticket ) . Like I said Ticket to Ride is an excellent game , but Ticket to Ride Europe just steps it up an extra notch without going overboard .	1
Great game for all , we love to play this game , even if there are only two of us . I would recommend this game to anyone .	1
I Love this game ! This game has a very simple concept , build your railways to connect the cities on your cards and earn the most amount of points . While the concept is simple there is a ton of strategy in this game which makes it a lot of fun to play . I think it is more fun to play with 4 people than 2 , but , my husband and I have had plenty of fun playing this game just the two of us . Each time the game is different because you get different cards with different routes , eventually you know most of the routes , but it does n't take away any of the enjoyment of this game .	1
Based on the excellent reviews , we bought Ticket to Ride ( original USA version ) for Christmas . We love board games in our house . Our favorites include many Game Wright games , Balderdash , Pictionary , Banagrams . We are willing to try any kind of game.Ticket to Ride has an amazing consensus on Amazon . Almost everyone seems to love it . This now includes our family . We played it for the first time recently , and it was great fun . Many others have already described the mechanics of the game . The game board is a large fold-out map of the United States and Canada , with routes connecting various cities , sometimes with designated colors , sometimes without . The goal is to amass points by 1 ) building routes by collecting cards of certain train colors , 2 ) building longer routes to increase point totals , 3 ) blocking opponents ' routes along the way . There are bonus points for the longest route built . The longer the route between cities , the greater the number of points.We have not played any expansions , but I am looking forward to playing the game on the iPad . I think it would be so cool to play a world expansion involving boats , air travel , maybe submarine travel . The possibilities for iPad play are endless.The cards are small , but this was not a huge issue for me . The trains are cool plastic pieces , and the illustrations are beautifully colored . The map is also large , easy to read , and beautifully illustrated -- -not too masculine , not too feminine , with just the right amount of vintage flair . The cardboard is thick and sturdy . My only criticism is that the trains , once placed , tend to slide around . I wish there were some mechanism for them to stay on the tracks . E-play would solve this problem .	1
I had no idea this was a board game until my friend introduced me to the greatness that is the Days of Wonder company . I usually play this every few weeks . The setup is pretty simple but you definitely have to plan ahead to win at this game . I 'm looking forward to buying some of the expansion packs .	1
I bought this for my adult children . They love games that are not so easy ... and said this game can be played on many levels . They enjoy the challenge and the fun ... and seeing how differently they all think . It is well played..over and over . Each game is a new adventure .	1
Ticket to Ride is one of the best games I have ever played and it quickly became a family favorite and classic . It is the only board game my mom and my mother in law will play due to the easy concept . We purchased the 1912 expansion and have replaced the tiny color train cards with the larger cards and we like it better - easier to hold onto . We never get tired of playing this game !	1
When I first heard about Days of Wonder 's newest game , Ticket to Ride ( Days of Wonder , 2004 - Alan Moon ) , I was excited . But how could I not be - for all of Days of Wonders games so far have been fabulous , and it seems that each successive game gets better and better . And Alan Moon with a train game ( shades of Union Pacific ) sounded like a winning combination . I had an opportunity to play the final version of the game , and was quite impressed with how the game looked.And is the game any good ? The short answer is that once you play this game , you 'll never play TransAmerica again . It 's a fantastic medium-weight game - one that plays equally well with two to five players . The components are superb , the artwork is great , the game is downright fun ( and nasty sometimes ) , and the total package is a very strong contender for the Spiel des Jahres 2004 . ( which it won ! ) After my first playing , I ranked it an 8 ; but after multiple playings the rating moved up to a 9 , then a 9.5 - and if I keep playing the game at this rate - may move into my top ten list . Game play is very tight , and I found that game scores can run very close - making for an exciting game , all the way down to the finish.Each player receives forty-five train cars in one color , and places a matching round token of that color on a scoring track . A large board is placed in the middle of the table , with a map of America ( circa late 1800 's ) superimposed upon it . Thirty-six cities are there , each connected by one or two `` railroad lines '' . These lines are made up of one to six spaces , and are one of eight colors : purple , yellow , black , white , green , red , blue , brown , and gray ( neutral color ) . A deck of `` tickets '' is shuffled , and three are dealt to each player . Players may discard one of them , but must keep at least two of them . Each ticket has two cities on them , and a point value that a player will receive if they connect those two cities , or lose if they do n't connect the cities . The remainder of the ticket cards are shuffled and placed in a face down pile next to the board . A pile of train cards is shuffled , and four are dealt to each player . The remainder are shuffled and placed next to the board , then five of them are turned over and placed face-up next to the draw pile . The player who has traveled the most goes first , and then play continues clockwise around the table.On a turn , a player may do one of three things . They may draw two cards , one at a time from either the face-up cards and/or the draw pile . Each card shows a different color of train car - matching the eight different colored spaces on the board . There is twelve of each color car in the deck . There are also eighteen `` locomotive '' cards , which function as wild cards . When a player draws a face-up card , the card is replaced immediately before they draw another card . A locomotive card counts as two cards if drawn when face-up , but only one if drawn when face-down . If there are ever three locomotive cards face-up at any time , all five cards are immediately discarded , and five new cards are drawn . If the cards run out , the discard pile is shuffled back to form a new draw deck.The second thing a player may do is to draw three ticket cards . They must keep at least one of them , but have the option of keeping all of them , if they like . The others ( if any ) , are discarded.The third thing a player may do is play cards to place their train cars on the board . A player may play one through six cards of the same color ( including wild cards ) , to place the same amount of train cards on a corresponding line on the board . For example , Las Vegas is connected to Salt Lake City by an orange line consisting of three spaces . Three orange cards must be played to put three trains of that player 's color on those spaces . No more players could then place anything between those two cities , and if players want to connect those two cities with their lines , they 'll have to go around the long way ( if possible ) . Gray lines can have any color cards played to place trains on them , but the cards played must match the number of spaces in the gray line , and all of the cards must be the same color . When placing trains , the player doing so receives points - 1 point for one train placed , 2 points for two trains , 4 points for three trains , 7 points for four , 10 points for five , and 15 points for six trains . Some cities have two lines connecting them , both of which can be used in a four or five-player game . In a two or three-player game , however , once one of these lines has been used , the other can not .When one player , after taking their turn , is down to two train cars or less , the final round begins . Starting with the player to their left , each player has one final turn , and then the game is over . The trains on the board are counted to make sure that the points were totaled correctly during the game , and then ticket cards are revealed . If players can trace a continuous path between the two cities on their card with their color train cars only , they receive the points , and move their tokens accordingly . Otherwise , they lose the points , and must move their token down the scoring track that many points . The player who has the longest continuous track also gets ten points . The player with the most points is the winner ! Some comments on the game ... 1 . ) Components : As usual , the components for Ticket to Ride are supreme . Days of Wonder has , by far , more superior components for their games than any other company . The board is fantastic , with a nice map , and when the train cars - nice plastic cars in bright colors - are placed on it , the whole thing looks pretty fantastic ! The cards are of the highest quality , and are about half the size of normal playing cards . Each color card not only has a different train car on it , but they have symbols in the corners to help differentiate between the colors ( good for the color blind ) . Everything fits into a wonderful plastic insert that is in a beautiful , sturdy box - the same size as Days of Wonder 's other Big Box Games.2 . ) Rules : The rules are only four pages - large , colorful , illustrated pages - but only four ! The game is being printed in many languages - and has the distinction of being the first major game release that I know of that has been produced in Korea , something which is rather dear to my heart . The game can be explained in about 5 minutes , and I am very pleased at how easy it is for people to pick up . Even people who have a hard time understanding simple games ( `` No , John , you can not attack people in Settlers of Catan ! '' ) had an easy time picking up the game - and I was amazed at how fast strategies were picked up.3 . ) Strategy : When I first was taught the game by Eric Hautemont , CEO of Days of Wonder , I did n't think that strategy would be that important . Then , he beat us , scoring 162 points to my 82 , and my friends 54 . I was floored ! I thought that I was doing well , during the game , but realized several things that I missed afterwards . I found out in the game that there are different strategies , and was impressed with how they differed . One can ignore their ticket cards and just try to place long trains , hoping to get a lot of points . Or one can try to complete as many ticket cards as possible , not worrying too much about how long of trains they place on the board . Then , there is the middle ground - but is a compromise of the two strategies enough to win ? Not to mention the fact that players must watch other players , and occasionally place trains to mess them up.4 . ) Cutthroat : This gives the game a real `` cut throat '' atmosphere . Sometimes the best move for a player is to place train cars between cities they do n't care that much about - just to stop another player - either from getting the longest chain of cars , or completing their tickets . This can cause some enmity , but it 's all in good fun , and I really enjoyed the player interaction - from taking cards to placing trains.5 . ) Holding cards : It 's fun to get a big hand of cards ( there is no upper limit ) . Players try to hoard cards so that they can place long trains of cars , scoring the big points . Also , players must always keep in mind that everyone else is watching them , trying to determine where they are going . The longer a player keeps the cards in their hand , the less they tip their hand . However , if one player suddenly uses up all their trains , causing the final round , and you are stuck with a huge hand of cards , it can be quite devastating . My wife found this out the hard way . She was about to connect three cities that would complete two of her tickets - probably winning the game . Another friend of mine , in the same game , had the same problem . Either one of them could have won the game , but because they held the cards just one turn to long - they lost . Of course , I was the evil guy who caused the game to end , but I got my just desserts , losing by only one point to yet another player - and the winning point was caused by her having the longest continuous train of cars.6 . ) Fun Factor : And yet , even with the bluffing , and the other little nasty tactics , the game is extremely fun . The decisions are short , causing the game to move quickly , but can be quite stressful at times . Yet these decisions really make the game fun ! Blocking someone else off , using your own lines , pulling two locomotives from the draw pile , or finally connecting those two cities - all of this adds up to a wonderful time of fun ! 7 . ) Time and Players : The game runs quickly , because the decisions are important , but do n't bog the game down to much . I was impressed with how well the game scaled , but found that the two-player game was much different than a five-player one . Both were fun , but needed different tactics.As you can see , I really enjoyed this game . I think it has strong possibilities of being one of the best games of the year . Alan Moon has always been one of my favorite designers , and this is one of his best games in years . Days of Wonder has put a lot of time and effort into producing this game , and it shows . When I first played TransAmerica , I thought that it was a boring game -what was the point , and where was the strategy ? Fortunately , the strategy and fun in this game are wonderful . I do n't need a `` dumbed-down '' game to introduce new folks to the wonderful world of board games . I can just use games like this - tremendous , fun games , filled with tactical choices and enjoyable times.Tom Vasel	1
TTR is pretty much my goto game for any group of folks 'new ' to modern adult board games : -very simple gameplay - draw some cards , play some matching cards , put trains on the board , lather rinse repeat-rules can be taught to even attention-deficited folk in a matter of minutes . No long boring recitation of rules . Just unpack start playing and explain while executing first turn ( s ) .-while simple to play/teach , there is enough strategy in the game to keep more experienced players 'in ' the game-short play time and quick turns prevents new players from becoming bored and losing interest . Also permits firing up an immediate second game if the first go is a hit .	1
This is a fun game for families or casual game players . It has a fun premise of trying to build out a rail network to collect the most points . There is not much strategy involved as it is much more oriented toward random distribution of the cards . That said for a 45 minute game it is fun !	1
This is a fun game , but it takes a while to play it . You 'll need to play it once to get all the rules and understand the strategies .	1
When it comes to games there are few that interest both me and my wife . I like competitive strategy games and she like more simple family friendly ones . This game is the best of both worlds . Whether you are a hard core board-gamer looking for strategy and competition or looking for a easy game to play with your anyone from your kids to seniors , this game is for you . It is simple enough to explain in less than 5 minutes but compelling enough to keep you coming back for more again and again . As a side note I would highly recommend that you buy the 1910 expansion with it since it provides 36 additional destination cards and reprints the originals to a more manageable size . Hop on the train of Ticket to Ride and you wo n't be disappointed !	1
We like this game . It 's easier to play online because there are so many pieces . We do n't play often . It does get a bit boring if you play too often with friends and family . If you play with the same people and the same board you just get to know their strategies .	1
This game is really easy to learn and lots of fun . It works best with three or more players . It moves along pretty quickly and requires a good combination of strategy and luck . We really enjoy it !	1
This is another hit to my collection of board games . Everybody loves it , and this wins more often than settlers of catan for the game to play , since it 's a little more competitive .	1
Best train game ever . Over millions sold and it is a all time favorite . Very easy to teach and play . A definite must buy !	1
For those of you who are interested in playing a boardgame , but have really no experience in playing them , this is a great start . Anyone over the age of six or so should not have a problem sitting down and enjoying this beautiful and sleek game.The mechanics are very easy . Collect cards with train cars of the same color to buy enough train cars to cover a route . If there is five blue spaces you need five blue train cards . It really is that simple . There are some wild cards and destination cards that add a bit to the variety , but the what makes this game fun is it 's simplicity . Grandparents to grand children can all sit around the table and enjoy this one . My wife and I play and she loves the fact that she can beat the snot out of me in this game .	1
An easy game to learn , but with endless strategy and luck . Good for 2-4 players . Build your routes and block your opponents . Fun for anyone 10+ in age .	1
This game is wonderfully fun . Your kids ( and YOU ! ) will learn about geography in a new , fun way ! It 's a good game for 2-5 people and is simply a beautiful game - from the pieces , the cards , and the board . Be sure to put on 1940s music as background when you play it !	1
Very rich in themePlays with a lot of people.Very hard to winCharacters are well thought out but the abilities and powers do n't seem to stand out to much ( some are very cool though ) Varied gameplayPossible traitor ! ! ! ! ! Worth a buy	1
Some people will love the fact that this game is incredibly hard . Not complex mind you ; hard . It seems next to impossible to beat the evil forces in this game . It is alot of fun trying to figure out how you can achieve this , but good luck ever achieving it . Perhaps this is the draw of the game , and if you ever beat it , you 'll never want to do it again . I do n't know because we have never come close and now my gaming group never wants to play again . All because it is so tough . This is without even playing with the traitor . We tried that as well and we got completely smoked.Bottom Line : Is it fun ? Definately , but be ready for a puzzle as to how to ever beat this game .	1
My husband and I LOVE games , board games , strategy games , card games , we love games . Some of our favorites include Ticket to Ride , Memoir 44 , Munchkin Quest , Blokus , Tobago , Dominion , Bohnanza , Carcasonne ... just trying to give you an idea of whether or not you like the same types of games as us.I think reviews are such a ridiculous thing with games because different people like different things , so one person might love Ticket to Ride , and another person might hate it.So , now that you know what kinds of games we enjoy , if you enjoy the same ones , you can trust that you will also like this game.Shadows over Camelot is so fun and different ! I have never played anything like it before . The cooperative play is a lot of fun , especially since one person can secretly be out to ruin it for everyone else . So , there 's also that side of mystery , `` is someone scheming against me ? ? `` .The artwork is fun , and if you love mythical stories , like Camelot and the Round Table , you will especially like this game.There are different tasks to work on , that someone you 're playing with will find fun and its just an overall , challenging and family fun game.GREAT for a family with kids 12 and older or just adults.One of my favorites.Only downside , is that its a little bit longer than some games , and yes there are a lot of rules to read through.But personally , I think its worth it . : )	1
This game has a lot of moving pieces and is rather complicated to learn . It has different `` quests '' that the knights of the round table can complete for points . At the same time , the evil doers are competing against the knights to get points as well . What makes this game interesting is that each player has to complete a `` good '' action and an `` evil '' action at the same time . That is to prevent the team from easily guessing who the traitor is . The pictures are fun , the game board complicated , but there is lots of opportunity for strategy . The game cards have interesting actions on them . Takes lots of time to play and needs dedicated players but fun in general .	1
This game is quite frustrating , as even without a traitor , it is very hard to win ! Even with all players playing cooperatively , the game gets progressively harder as you and your friends beats the quests . It is amazingly fun and adrenaline packed , and if you like cooperative games , I 'd say Shadows over Camelot and Battlestar Galactica are your best bet !	1
Having been a boardgamer for many many years I was looking for something a little more complicated than another run around the edge of a board collecting game pieces until someone won by luck and endurance.This game fit the bill and then some ! ! All the players take on the role of one of the knights of Camelot . Your goal is to tilt the tables of good and evil so Camelot can endure . You have quests to complete and enemies to fight , all in the name of Camelot ! A really neat twist that the developers of the game threw in is that , while you are all working together to keep Camelot afloat , one of the players may in fact be seruptitiously working for evil and be plotting for the fall of the kingdom ! This is an option that can be eliminated if you either have a small group or do n't wish to have an antagonistic aspect of the game.This is a very complicated game and I found it much easier to learn the game by playing with experienced players at a local gaming convention and then bringing that knowledge back home . Playing this game cold from the instructions is a monumental task but can be done.The replay value of this game is already high but an expansion set is available .	1
After playing my first game of Days of Wonder 's & # 34 ; Shadows Over Camelot , & # 34 ; I was convinced that this was the kind of game that was the reason why board games were invented . By my third or fourth play through it easily became one of my favorite games of all time . Up to seven knights set out about various quests and must work together to defeat the forces of evil . In this semi-cooperative game each turn players must take an action for evil- take a hit , draw an evil card with dire effects for the knights , or place a siege engine before Camelot . Then they can take their own action like moving to a quest , playing cards to work upon completing a quest , drawing good cards , or fighting a siege engines . It is surprising just how quickly the various evil actions spell real trouble for the knights , so they must work together to make the best decisions for all.The problem , however , is that one of the knights is secretly an agent of evil , and wins the game if the knights lose . Every turn you will be questioning why a knight chose to lay a siege engine , why they did n't take that hit point , why they did something else that looks suspicious . You and your friends will freak out and then laugh a lot with this game . Needless to say you will have a lot of fun as you either must bluff or figure out just who the traitor is before it 's too late . When it 's all over , this game will leave you with a big smile on your face . I guarantee it .	1
Shadows Over Camelot : 3-7 Players , Ages 10+ , Average Play Time = 60-90 MinutesShadows Over Camelot is unlike anything that I 've ever played before , even though I have played quite a few cooperative games . The artwork is excellent and the miniatures are surprisingly detailed . It 's obvious that a lot of work went into the production of this game . My advice would be to make sure that you have a large table or playing surface , as all of the boards will take up a lot of room.This game is very difficult to win , in my opinion . It 's possible , of course , but players NEED to work together if they want to win . One thing that players will have to learn to accept from the beginning is that they will not be able to complete every quest ... some WILL fail ( unless players are very lucky ) . Evil progresses with every black card , which can occur every player turn if players choose to draw a card in place of placing a siege engine or losing life . Perfectionists like myself will find themselves getting frustrated as they watch things spiral out of control ... it 's very easy to feel helpless in this game.However , the game is flexible enough to where the rules can be bent , if you 're willing to be imaginative . When playing with the kids , I chose to skip the `` take an evil action '' step every other rotation ... that is ... players will take an evil action every other turn . This turned the game into a casual , enjoyable experience that I did n't have to stress too much over . Sure , you can call it cheating , but no one wins on family game night if we all end up frustrated ... *shrug* . I 'd rather bend the rules a little and ensure that the kids are having a good time . You can take that a step further by ignoring the `` if you draw a black card that affects a completed quest , place a siege engine instead '' rule . Be creative.I personally enjoyed working together with the kids ( Devonn - 11 , Vinnie - 11 ) to complete the quests . I allowed everyone to show their cards so that we could work together to complete the quests . Even with all of the quote unquote cheating , it was still challenging as we often had to abandon one quest to stop another from spiraling out of control . The kids picked up on the game very quickly and were glad that I had decided to make things easier . I normally take a leadership role in cooperative games with the kids , but they were planning their combat cards to complete straights and pairs for quests all on their own.Overall , Shadows Over Camelot is a fun cooperative game . You can customize it to be as easy or as difficult as you want it to be , which is always a bonus . The traitor mechanic adds extra tension to the game , as players will be constantly suspecting each other . All of this chalks up to be one unique social experience ... an experience that I have enjoyed . If you enjoy cooperative games and do n't mind a challenge , I have a feeling that you 'd enjoy it too .	1
This game is a great co-operative game ! It is very fun and not to complex.Has a good theme and build quality ( Days of Wonder never dissapoints ) The Traitor Mechanic is awesome . Similar to that of the Battlestar Galactica Board Game.It is hard to beat but fun and not too long of a game.I 'd say if you love Cooperative games and a good fantasy/medieval setting then this is a must have.I doubt you 'll be disapointed !	1
The first time , it took 45-minutes to set up the board and read through the instruction manual . Around the 3rd round through all six players we found our stride and everyone 's turn went much faster.Pro 's : + Easy game mechanics+ Each person 's turn did n't last that long , so you are n't sitting forever waiting for five or more other players to go before you get your turn+ Each person 's turn matters , so it keeps everyone engaged as three players before you may dramatically change what you should do on your turn+ Great play intensity . The games quickly become a neck-and-neck race between Evil and Heroes+ Beautiful board , cards and pieces+ Every knight 's special abilities can help win or lose the game . Do n't forget to use your special abilities every time you can ... or at least consider using them.+ Without the Traitor we still only win about 50-60 % of the time ... it 's that well balanced of a game.+ It seems once one character dies , the rest start taking bigger risks and dying more frequent as the game climaxes into a neck-n-neck race+ Good replayability , as you mix up who plays what knights ; as players pursue different quests and of course the randomness of the card drawing+ Plenty of house rule and variant game options can be found on BoardGameGeekCon 's : - Not much of a con , but if you get the expansion , there is no room in the main box to combine them . You need two separate boxes.Neutral : - We did n't like playing with the rule of not sharing information between players ... even though if one knight is off on a Grail quest by themselves they `` realistically '' could n't communicate with other knights . Sharing everything in the early games is a great way for new players to learn the mechanics and begin to understand the different decisions they too may face as they draw cards.- There are rules that allow a new player/knight to join mid-game . This could be used for player 's who knight dies , so they are n't sitting there twiddling their thumbs watching everyone else still playing . But it feels somewhat of a `` cheat '' for the Heroes side , to have a new knight `` suddenly show up . `` OVERALL : This is a family favorite . In the top five best family games , along with7 Wonders , Pandemic Board GameandTicket To Ride - Europe , which some of our family favorites .	1
Fun game , we like the traitor aspect , and the cooperative play . It plays in under 2 hours , no problem , and the components feel very solid .	1
My son got this game from his uncle for Christmas , and my family has had a blast playing it . There is a lot of strategy involved in winning , especially with a traitor , but the rules are not too complex . It has quickly become the favorite game in our house.One nit -- the heroes are all men ( after all this is Camelot ) , and there are several evil cards featuring women ( Morgan , Guinevere , Vivien ) . So we balanced out the sexism issue with some female hero cards having new powers , so my daughter can play a female hero . Maybe Days of Wonder can come out with an expansion pack that features some women who kick butt !	1
this game is worth buying and keeping in your collection forever ! it is a cooperative game SORT OF . all the players are working together to defeat the impending evil around the knights at Camelot . however , there is POTENTIALLY ( but not necessarily ) a traitor in the midst . at the beginning of the game , you deal out 1 card to each player . that one card tells each player whether they are loyal or the one traitor . however , the traitor card may or may not be in the stack of cards you dealt out . so nobody knows for sure . there are so many win/loose conditions that the game play is different every time . the traitor gets to decide his/her own strategy . there are pros and cons to revealing him/herself early , or trying to remain hidden the entire game . cooperative games can be a lot of fun , but this cooperative game is like none other . you wont find another game like this . if feels difficult to learn at first , but once you get it , it 's a breeze . not super heavy . but beyond a gateway game for sure . GET THIS GAME !	1
I 'm not a fan of role-playing , but my husband is . While this is n't an actual role plating game like D & D ; or Shadowrun , it has similar elements and style . In this game , the players do n't compete against each other but against the game ( unless one of them is the `` traitor '' but that 's another matter ! ) . Players work together as knights of the round table to complete quests before evil wins the game . Different knights have different skills , and each quest has a different prize to help the players win the game . While this game is fun , my main issue with it was that the odds seem stacked in favor of evil.Evil gets an action every turn . Knights are allowed one heroic action per turn - but , movement counts as the turn . For example , if I am working on the Grail Quest , I can lay down a grail card as my action . But , if I do n't have a grail card to play , I have to return to the round table in order to draw cards from the draw pile - but returning to Camelot counts as my heroic action so I have to wait until the next turn to actually draw the cards ! Plus , there is the added problem that one of the players may be a traitor working against the team . So , my husband and I made a house rule that drawing cards still counts as a heroic action , but you can draw from anywhere on the board.The game is nicely designed , but with a lot of small plastic pieces , the durability is n't as good as it could be . I recommend this game for anyone looking for something new and interesting to play .	1
I find this to be a fun co-op , but I played it in several different groups of gamers and it went over just OK. After a year of not seeing the table I sold it . There just does n't seem to be enough there to keep people coming back to it . There are not enough deep choices .	1
I went for this game just for its theme . I did not read any reviews , never thought about price , never learned about its game mechanics . All that mattered was the theme and the fact that is a board game for seven players . ( a very rare occurrence , and a valious commodity in my game group , that almost any session reaches seven or eight players , so we generally must use BATTLESTAR GALACTICA with PEGASUS expansion or race games like the out-of-print CIRCUS MAXIMUS , FORMULA D , MOTO GRAND PRIX , etc . Sometimes , we even stretch RUNEBOUND for 7 players ) .So , I knew it was a risk . But it was worth it . This game is good . Game components and game board are beautiful ( of course , the miniatures could have been painted , but that is asking too much ... ) . Game mechanics is based on cards , but I 'll tell you : seldom have I had so much pleasure dealing with cards in a game ! They capture the flavour of the Arturian legends ( if you watched EXCALIBUR , the game will blow your mind ) and add to exciment , instead of making the game come to a stop.It 's truly a cooperative game . It 's the only way to win . But the group of players must decide beforehand the extent of that cooperation . Sharing almost everything to the point of almost showing your cards to the other players is wrong and will make the game fairly easy for the players to ever win , even with the traitor in play .	1
This is a great Co-op game , that also have the option for traitors . Like many games , this has a sweet spot of players -- with too few , it can be hard to win . You all play as Knights of King Arthur 's Round Table , and complete quests , in an attempt to win White Swords for the table . Failing quests can put black swords on the table . There is also the potential for a hidden traitor , whom can work against the crew . As time goes on , the castle becomes besieged , the traitor can toss good cards away so they are n't put to use , and the table fills up with its share of both White and Black swords . In the end , if the traitor is not revealed , he can turn swords from white to black , when the table is full -- but guessing incorrectly who the traitor is has its own negative consequences ! This game is full of teamwork and strategy , special abilities , and some random luck chance of cards drawn from a deck . It is a lot of fun , has great replay value , and takes a couple of hours . The cards , pieces and boards are all well made , sturdy , and quick well illustrated .	1
very fun game . Better with at least 4 players , I prefer at least 6 .	1
I have a family full of board game geeks and fans so we play on a regular basis . We are constantly looking for that next great game to add to our collection . I got Shadows Over Camelot as a birthday gift this summer and it has quickly become our favorite game to play with family and friends . First off the components of this are are beautiful ; the pieces look like real knights and they are really well made . The game is simple to play but yet EXTREMELY hard to master . What makes this game great is that one of the knights could be a traitor and be playing against the rest of the knights throughout the game . This leaves a lot of variations to the game and no game is exactly like the previous one played . The basic premise is that you are a knight of the round table and you must quest throughout Camelot to save the realm . You work with your fellow knights to defeat quests such as the holy grail , a war with the Picts , The Black Knight , saving Excalibur and a few others . As I said before one of the knights may be a traitor and could be sabotaging you throughout the game . Overall this game is a blast every time we play it because it changes every time . I would suggest that a player be at least 13 years old because the game play may be easy but the strategy is very complex .	1
Cooperative board games can offer varying levels of a `` learning curve '' in terms of how long it takes for all the players to learn the mechanics and nuances of play . Forbidden Island is fairly quick , Pandemic is somewhere in the middle . Shadows Over Camelot could likely take one entire game to fully figure out , and that means you 'll probably lose the first time . This could cause new or casual boardgamers to become bored or disinterested . My suggestion would be to play one of those other games with people who are n't familiar with cooperative games yet , and THEN drop this gem on them.Like all cooperative games , the goal is to beat the game itself . You have several heroes of Camelot at your disposal to attempt this , each with a unique special ability . The catch is that one of them is possibly a traitor , secretly helping the forces of evil advance . The more players you have at the table , the easier it is to win the game , so I recommend that if you 're playing with a large group , definitely employ the traitor . This can be a very social game , and casting suspicion over questionable decisions is part of the fun . So is casting suspicion on others if YOU are the traitor ! Of course if you want a friendly , easier game just remove the traitor . With fewer players , you might want to do this anyway , because even without the traitor , it is HARD to win this game with just 3 or 4 knights . At some point , you 'll wish you had started the game with Arthur so you could slip Galahad a special card , or as Sir Tristan so you could jump to a quest as a free action , etc.Here 's why it 's hard : Your group must simultaneously fight off advancing Saxons and Picts from opposite shorelines , defend Camelot from siege , find the Holy Grail , secure Lancelot 's armor , retrieve Excalibur from the Lady of the Lake , and occasionally leave your group to face off in a solo combat against the Black Knight . Is that enough ? Actually it 's too much , and therein lies the strategy . You have to prioritize which quests you 'll try to complete , while trying to keep the others from failing entirely . Completed quests earn you white swords on the Round Table . Failed quests earn black swords . If the black swords cover more than half the table at anytime , you lose . If Camelot falls to siege catapults because you were out questing elsewhere , you lose . If all of your knights die , you lose . Get it ? It 's hard.That 's what makes winning this game all the more exciting , because with the right placement of knights , sharing and playing of cards , self-sacrifice , and just a little luck ( yes , there is some card-drawing and dice-rolling involved ) , you will win . Even when we 've lost this game , we `` fought as brothers until the end '' , and had lively conversation reflecting on what we should have done , if we 'd known what was coming . Once we won because Sir Kay sacrificed his life points to zero to win a combat that if we had lost would have lost us the game . Instead we won , and the rest of us paid for that player 's share of the grub for the next game night . You do n't get that with Monopoly , folks.As usual , the artwork and quality components from Days of Wonder make Shadows Over Camelot a really immersive , thematic gaming experience . If you have friends into the Arthurian legends , or are ready for a real cooperative challenge , grab your swords and helmets and spend a couple of hours with this game .	1
Days of Wonder strikes again with a game that combines playability , skill , repeat play ability and twists and turns enough keep you guessing till the end.It is a game easy enough for kids and challenging enough for adults , and it is a fast enough play so that a group can finish it and still play something else . Our gaming group usually has one or two people who show up late due to work ( this happens when you game in your 40 's ) this game is an excellent multi player choice to play while waiting for the latecomers.The basics are these you play one of the Knights of Camelot and try to complete quests as either teams or as individuals . Each Knight has abilities specific to himself . The different quest vary from the Holy Grail to the recovery of the Sword Excalibur to more mundane quests like defeating Picts or Saxons or solo quests such as defeating the Black Knight.You can quickly adjust the skill level of the game by playing with our without the traitor rule . With the traitor rule one player is a traitor , but his loyalty is known only to him at the start of the game.If Days of Wonder keeps putting out quality stuff like this pretty soon I 'll be calling the old Avalon Hill `` Avalon who ? ''	1
Shadows Over Camelot is a many things . One one level , it 's a cooperative game where the fabled Knights of the Round Table ( the player ) engage on quests and hope to fulfill their obligations as nights . On the other hand , it can turn into a highly competitive game versus the traitor that had been hiding among their ranks . But this requires some explanation first.Given 3-7 players , everyone gets to be one of the Knights of the Round Table - including King Arthur himself . Each Knight is assumed to be loyal , but one may turn out to be the traitor depending on which role card the player draws at the beginning of the game . A traitor is not a requirement - even in a 7-player game there are a total of 8 loyalty cards with one of them being the traitor card . This adds an interesting element to the game as the potential traitor ( if there is one ) plays the game like any other Knight until he is exposed or he chooses to reveal himself.At the start of every player turn , the first step is the progression of evil , where the player must choose one way in which things get worse . His includes adding a siege engine to the attack on Camelot , losing a life point or drawing a black card , which can lead to a variety of effects that delay quests or affect the players themselves in negative ways . Once that has been resolved , the player then has one heroic action to take including leaving Camelot to start a quest or trying to fulfill a quest requirement by playing a white card . A player can sacrifice a life point to take a second yet distinct heroic action as well.Each knight has a special ability that can be used for free once a turn . For example , King Arthur trade any white card with another knight while Sir Kay can leave Camelot to start a quest for free . These different abilities are all potentially useful but can also indirectly reveal a potential traitor when such abilities are not used effectively.The quests are pretty diverse including the expected quests to seek the Holy Grail or retrieve Excalibur from the Lady of the Lake . Some quests can be addressed by a group of knights . Other quests require a single knight to face the danger including the Black Knight or Lancelot . But those solo quests are tricky - if you 're forced to leave the quest , all your progress gets discarded.So yes , I 've dedicated 4 different paragraphs of this review to just describe the rules . And at this point , that 's hardly enough to help you visualize why this game is so great . So let 's break it down.First , even without a traitor , this game is as challenging of other cooperative games like Pandemic and Forbidden Desert . The challenge of gathering enough white swords from the various quests is hard enough on its own , what more with the progression of evil making life all the more difficult with each and every player turn . And needing to help evil progress every turn before you even get to act is an amazing challenge in itself - and kind of traumatic , but in a good way.But the possibility of a traitor - note possibility and not a guarantee - is really what turns this game on its head . We 've had games where we started to accuse people of being the traitor but it turned out that they were just playing really badly . But the traitor needs to be found , otherwise 2 of your white swords at the round table will turn to black if a traitor remains undiscovered by the end of the game , There are a lot of mind games that go on in this game that makes every turn all the more stressful . And do n't forget the need to progress evil - every ... single ... turn.Shadows Over Camelot has surprised me with how complex it is and how rewarding it plays . And the fact that it allows for up to 7 players makes it a great addition to any game night .	1
Great gateway game that both gamers and non-gamers will enjoy . Other reviews do great job of explaining the game so I will just offer a few suggestions:1 . Buy the expansionShadows Over Camelot : Merlin 's Company . This adds more black and white cards , new travel cards , Merlin himself , and 8 or 9 new playable knight characters . This expansion really fleshes out and balances the game mechanics.2 . If you find the game too difficult , start everyone with 6 life points ( instead of 4 ) and/or every time a knight dies bring in a new knight until you have exhausted every color.3 . If you find the game too easy , try the squire mode ( as outlined in the rule book ) and/or add the Merlin 's Company expansion to the mix.Also , there is a Monty Python fan-based theme available at boardgamegeek.com .	1
Shadows Over Camelot is great fun to strategize over , but not as much fun to play . Do n't get me wrong , I enjoy playing this game quite a bit , but the strategy and planning is where most of the fun is derived . This game is different from others in that the players cooperate , it is not often that boardgames require this much teamwork.There are many `` quests '' to do in the game to hold off a losing scenario . I say hold off , because losing happens often . Some quests are easier than others , and some quests require multiple people to work on them at one time , which makes teamwork even more vital . It is a very negative game , as something bad happens ( by rule ) on each and every player 's turn . This makes winning a difficult task . I have played this game about five times , and have yet to win . I am determined to win , and my normal game buddies hope that our next strategy will be the one to finally save Camelot.Each player gets to choose one of the famous knights of the round table to be , and each knight comes with his own special ability . This adds a great deal of strategy to a game with loads of strategy already involved . Each player then chooses his or her own task to undertake ( often depending on what cards the player has ) . This is sometimes a solo quest , and sometimes as a small part of a much larger or ongoing multi-player quest.Winning requires you to complete enough quests before a losing scenario eventually comes to fruition . Completing the quests gives rewards which vary from quest to quest , and some of the rewards are extremely useful . The trick to winning is in utilizing each player in the best way possible to complete the quests.The game , as is the case with most all of the Days of Wonder games , is very well constructed . The knight figures have some pretty decent detail , and are made of a good plastic . The boards are thick and the artwork is excellent . The cards are typical playing card thickness and durability , and I do n't see them wearing out any time soon . This game will not need replacement parts due to wear and tear.Overall , this game has great potential for fun , and I have enjoyed myself in each session . Do n't get too addicted , though , as it has the potential to keep you strategizing deep into the night !	1
This is an incredibly difficult game with a lot of replayability . Bought this solely off of Tom Vassels review on Dice Tower.I love this game . It is cooperative so you ca n't be that competitive guy , but it offers you a twist that one player may be a Traitor.Each player is given a random loyalty card one of which is the traitor . Each player then takes control over their assigned Knight of the Round Table . Players then work together to complete quests some of which are team based and some are solo quests.Each turn , a player must first progress evil . This is done by placing a seige engine , drawing a black card , or taking a life point . then the player may make a heroic action : Move to a new quest , fight a seige engine , play a white card , or draw cards if at Camelot . It is a game of calculated risk and controlled chance . Winning quests earns white swords and losing a quest earns black swords . You have to have majority of white swords on the round table to win.Great game	1
I got these to use for my cooking club and my dinner parties . I just love how it gets conversation going far more than with the person who grabs the card . You have everyone take a card then go around and answer the questions . I give people enough time to think about their answer while eating if it 's a huge group , or if it is an intimate dinner party , we just go around and keep talking.Let 's say you get the card for example `` What would you choose for your last meal ? '' A guy answers some steak house and his excellent cook wife does a playful slam ... then everyone begins talking about the steak he named and their favorite place . And some new restaurant everyone has to try ... Or let 's say you get the card `` If you got a tattoo what would it be and where would you put it ? '' It 's great when someone has a tattoo that no one knows about -- that always starts a discussion about tattoos and why someone has them or someone says something funny like `` If I ever got a tattoo it would be something really messed up because I would NEVER get a tattoo so I 'd have to be really messed up if I did get one . `` Just silly things . It makes you think too though : `` If you could have any view from your back porch what would it be ? '' The funny gal might say `` a view of Bratt Pitt serving me dinner '' while the traveler might say `` A view of the ocean in Bora Bora '' whereas the nature lover might say `` A view of deer roaming , chickens frolicking , a stream bubbling , surrounded by trees and rocks '' It can be taken very differently by different people . `` What would you try if you had no fear ? '' gets the person holding the card to really ask themselves questions..including why they have n't tried something they want to : like starting a business , skydiving , learning to fly a plane ... It breaks the ice with questions you could not just bust out and ask , but that work great for learning about everyone without being forceful in your questions -- it makes the game maker the one who asks the question and it gets conversation ROCKING for a great evening.Also a very fun gift and a way to get the family talking during the holidays as well .	1
This is great for people who have a difficult time talking with there teens or kids or just bringing up any type of converstaiton that may not have been thought of . It teaches the value of family and getting to know each other by asking more than How was your day ? The granparents version is terrific for kids to bring to Grandma 's house when they havent seen them for a while to help discover what things were like when they were growing up and what they value as well .	1
We had a dinner party and decided to get this for the table . It was a huge hit ! Our friends loved it . Some of the questions worked better than others but that 's to be expected . There are enough in the box that guarantee there will be something in there for anyone and any setting . Great for getting to know people better and a great help if conversations die down and need a boost !	1
Great packaging , interesting questions , fast shipping . Would absolutly recommend . So far this is my favorite of the Table Topics ( I also have the Diner Party Edition )	1
This is a good spark to conversations when you are getting together with people you do n't know well . It is also a fun way to probe your spouse about topics you may not otherwise discuss .	1
My kids love these ! They got them for Christmas . For homework , they have to read for 20 minutes every evening . They use these to time themselves and it relieves me of hearing , & # 34 ; How long have I been reading ? & # 34 ; when I have no idea ! ! ! The kids have even tried to use them to time other things they do around the house .	1
So I see most of the reviews talk about how great these are at encouraging reading . I have to admit , I have a somewhat different use - to get my kids to stop reading and go to bed ! I was having such trouble getting them to STOP reading on school nights that on many nights , I was going to sleep before them . And they are in elementary school , so they needed more sleep than that . So I thought they might really like having a little beep go off when it was time to stop and go to bed . I decided to use the bookmarks by telling them what time they had to go to sleep , then they take a look at their clock and program it to beep when it 's lights out time . And it works ... .beautifully ! I would definitely recommend these to people who have kids who love to read ... just might need to encourage sleep to get them to school on time .	1
good way to encourage kids to read either for as long as they can or for the required time . 2 pack is more economical but through scholastic readers you can get for $ 3 . had I known ... .	1
I 've been wanting something like this for ages . I like having the ability to time speed reading for myself a little easier than using a stove timer or a hand timer . I just like having a sturdy colorful bookmark . I wish I had known that they were available in wild designs before I bought mine . Otherwise , I would of gotten the camouflage one . I think they are worth the money . I 'll end up adding stickers to mine though . ( I still like stickers , yes ) ... And reset is easy . You just press the Hours and Minutes . Their site has info videos on how it works . Though most people can pick it up right away . Very durable and kid proof product .	1
My daughter has had this product for 10 months now . She uses it daily for her homework and used it very regularly over the summer as well . Does a very nice job . Have n't yet had to replace the battery . And it helps her be more independent with her homework . Pleased with the product .	1
These are very helpful in tracking reading minutes for school . My responsible 10 year old son has made great use of his . One of them arrived with a dead battery , which was slightly annoying .	1
We use this timer as a bookmark and to time the kids ' reading every day ( its intended purpose ) . We love this bookmark/timer for this purpose . One comment though : the bookmark is heavy so will fall out of the book if the book is not stored flat . Since we carry our books around in our backpacks , I recommend a hair band to keep the book shut and the bookmark in place . Hair bands are less likely to curve the book by being too tight.But another , equally useful application is timing DS play ! And sharing toys . And how many minutes before bedtime . My three boys use their bookmark timer for all of these purposes and more - it 's a great way to help them start learning time management . My kids are currently 7 ( twins ) and 9 . All boys .	1
Love the idea of these bookmarks ( we have two ) and they 're pretty great , but not perfect . I do n't have the instructions ( as I recall , they arrived , we tore into the packaging -- do n't think we saved the paperwork ) , so it could be there 's a solution to this that I do n't know of . But the issue I have is that you ca n't tell that they 're on unless you stare long enough to see the minute click over . It shows seconds for a while , but once you 've read a certain amount , they 're no longer there . Just a little indicator that showed it was counting would make a big difference . On such a simple concept , that makes the difference between 4 and 5 stars for me.Otherwise , we 've used them for a couple of weeks now and so far , so good .	1
Not very easy for my little kids to use but it works . They get confused on the up or down arrow . Not sure on the settings until after a minute , then the clock shows the minute/time . They like to see the seconds too but this does n't have the seconds . I keep one in the van so when we are on the road I can keep track of their reading . The library gives them awards/prizes for minutes read in the summer . They will read for prizes and this is a good way for me to keep track .	1
I like my 7 year old daughter to read for 20 minutes 4 to 5 times a week and this is a great tool that we have found very helpful . She likes to read and we normally do not have problems with getting her to read for 20 minutes but this is a the perfect tool that she can use to track her time . There is an Up counter which means it will start at 0 and go up to keep track of how many minutes you read and then there is a down counter that will count down from , say 20 minutes , until you get to 0.I found it a little difficult to set up at first but after reading the instructions that comes with it it now is very simple.Great tool , durable and we will be using this for our nightly readings .	1
I bought one for my son who loves to read . This one is not as easy to lose as a regular bookmark . It uses an LR1130 button battery . You will need a watch screw driver to open the compartment . It beeps when the time is up . You can set it up as a countdown , count up or cumulative ( adds up the time every time you pause and start again ) . It also is a regular digital clock when timer is not being used . Bubble wrapped . Made in China.Setting the clock for the first time : -Press and hold Mode button until all 4 digits blink.-Press Hrs and Mins to correct time-Press Mode once to setSorry there is no alarm clock function . Alarm ( or I should say , beeping ) is only for the countdown timer.Pros : - Fun- CuteCons : - Do not lose the instruction . Setting the clock , or setting the timer may be tricky if you forget how to do it.- Top heavy and thicker than a regular bookmark- On setting up the timer , once you make an error by putting a wrong time ( if you want 30 minutes but somehow you pressed the hour button ) , you can not go backward unless you reset . To reset , you hold the Hour and Min button at the same time for a couple of seconds . Then the timer will go back to zero . Dont worry , it will not reset the clock , just the timer .	1
Many people buy these timers for their children but I have discovered that they are also very useful to teachers . I use these digital bookmarks to time the activities we do in class . The timer lets me know in a very discreet manner that the time I have assigned for an activity has elapsed . It 's easy to carry it around in the gradebook where it serves an extra purpose of marking the page.The digital bookmark is very durable . You have the option of exchanging the battery but the batteries the timers are sold with last a very long time .	1
My daughter is in the first grade and reads for 20 minutes as part of her homework . She also has a tendency to move from one line to the next mid sentence , so I wanted to get her something that would help her stay on the line that she was reading , I figured this would be nice since she could also have a timer at hand that would be easy for her to check to see how much time she had left . She really enjoys it , it is also nice as a bookmark and helping her keep her place on the page . I am very happy with it .	1
HAve a deal with my son for every minute he reads he gets a minute of electronic time . Was getting hard to keep track , so this was the perfect addition to our deal . Easy for him to use , and easy to read .	1
Got this for my daughter so she could time how long she 's read . It works great . Can use it for a clock timer and even a stop watch great product for a kid or even adult who loves to read !	1
I bought one of these for my son , but as he was not interested in reading and never sat for any length of time I ended up giving it to my daughter so she could track her time for the summer reading program at the library . It works great.I just ordered this one because now that my son is getting more into reading , and he is also in the summer reading program and needs to complete a certain number of hours . He does feel a little motivated as well to see his time accumulating ... .The only improvement I could see in the devise is the ability to add or subtract time from the total . For example , if your child read but did n't have the timer around you could add the minutes later . Or , as I am afraid might have happened with my son at this very moment , if your child falls asleep with the timer on it will count minutes that he/she was not actually reading , so you might want to take time off . It would be nice if this feature was available .	1
I got two bookmarks and both of them worked fine . My kids love them for tracking school reading . This would be a good gift .	1
I bought this for my 7 year old and he thinks its so funny . I still need to find some funny ways to put him in the house . I bought the Elf on The Shelf DVD and will act like the elf brought it to him . He loves it and so do me and my husband . My 14 year old even likes it .	1
My kids love their elf & # 34 ; Chippey & # 34 ; . Every morning from after thsnkgiving to Christmas eve they wake up and the first thing they do is run to try and find where he is hiding . I think it is a nice , fun family tradition .	1
My Grandson loved his Elf and we had fun coming up with ways for & # 34 ; Cleatus & # 34 ; to help our grandson behave during all the hustle and bustle of the season .	1
We love the Elf on the Shelf ! - This name is Umi .	1
What 's not to love about the Elf on the Shelf ? My 8 year old was sooooo excited to receive this on Christmas , and , when he 's acting up , all we have to do is remind him that the elf is watching , and he straightens up . Plus , how cute is it for us as parents to think of creative scenarios to put the elf in ? Very happy with this purchase !	1
We 've really enjoyed our elf & # 34 ; Ok & # 34 ; over the past two years . My girls wake up each morning for a month before Christmas wondering where Ok is . Sometimes I forget and have to create a diversion before they see me move him - hahaha . It makes the holidays all the more special . There is a tv special that tells a story about the elves , that helped them understand what was going on .	1
What a great time we had with the elf on the shelf this Christmas . W changed the story up a bit since we are Christians , but it was a blast with the grand kids . I bought the African American elf . I appreciate the ethnic option	1
My son loved finding this everyday . I did unstick his hands and then put wire in his arms in legs . You can find blogs and youtube videos on how to . I would recommend so you can make him do more fun things .	1
This was a gift for my niece and nephew ! A new Christmas tradition for them . The book is super cute and has already been read well over 30 times . They love the elf . I do not think he looks & # 34 ; creepy & # 34 ; at all . Super sweet and cute more like it . He has tight stitching and a detailed face . This is just a fun and creative was to countdown to Christmas . Makes each of the mornings exciting . The elf comes in many different eye colors , skin colors and even in girl . However makes it a little more difficult to pick just one , I had a brown eyed boy and blue eyed girl . We settled on the blue eyed boy , a little from each . Plus elves have just always been boys in my mind ; )	1
All I can say is for the time from Thanksgiving to Christmas this elf was very busy talking to Santa about my 4 year old grand daughter . It was magical .	1
I thought this was a little expensive for what you get , but my son loved finding the elf all over the house so much that I feel it was worth the expense .	1
Everyone knows these are awesome , so I will add to this awareness in saying , it 's adorable and just what you expect .	1
bought for day care use the children had a greattime with him . Every morning it was a hunt for the elf . They had a great time with him .	1
Bought it this past Christmas season for my 5yo daughter to enjoy . It was adorable to watch her face light up every morning as our elf , Blizzy , moved around the house . She was sad to see him go Christmas Eve , so I will definitely be looking into the birthday book and outfit for him ! Such a cute idea : )	1
I have n't actually used this yet since it is n't Christmas but I am looking forward to using it . On Pinterest.com it shows many positions to put this little guy in . I wish they had had the one with the skirt when I purchased mine but they were all out .	1
This elf on a shelf has got my son doing remarkable things . He is being relly nice to his sister and he is helping out when he never would . He asks everyday if Norby ( the name of the elf ) is going to tell Santa he was good today . We always tell when he was good and Norby will probably give Santa a good report .	1
The Elf on the Shelf is a HUGE hit with my granddaughters ! We read the story and put the elf on the bookcase where he could watch everyone . The next morning , he had been to visit Santa and had returned - now perching on top of the draperies . I know we 'll be checking for him every morning until Christmas and we 'll all be very good , knowing he 's reporting to Santa every night.This is a delightful gift for young believers .	1
It came in such a cute little set with the book and elf . My kids were excited that he came from the North Pole and it just added so much adventure to the Christmas season . They are looking forward to him & # 34 ; coming back again & # 34 ; next year !	1
I purchased 3 of these for Christmas 2011 . Our family celebrates the week before Christmas so the elves began their duties for a short time that year . Well as Christmas 2012 approaches , the elves have made their way back from the North Pole , the kids were very excited when they made their first elf sighting . So now the elves have once again taken up their work of reporting to Santa ! What fun for all !	1
My kids LOVE elf on the shelf ! They have been talking about it a summer and ca n't wait for Christmas to get here so Frankie can come back out ! It 's been a great reminder to make sure they are doing the right things .	1
A Christmas classic ! A wonderful story to get your child into the fantasy world of the legend of Santa Claus & the North Pole . Keeps the child 's imagination when the Elf is in a different place each morning .	1
Nice story ! The kids really look forward to the elf coming and staying with them till Christmas Eve . The kids enjoy looking for him each day and I love reminding him that he is watching . The kids are a little skeptical about Christmas , I hope I get another year of the magic .	1
I 've never seen one little doll work such magic , LOL ! I kept one of these in my classroom and here at my house and the behavior in both places improved ten fold ! Love it !	1
This is a great story and so much fun ! It definitely keeps the spirit of Christmas alive ! It is as much fun for the adults as the kids !	1
Item was as expected . Ca n't wait to start using it . Because it is an item that is to be used for the Holidays I have to wait until Thanksgiving to see how much the kids will enjoy it .	1
I 'm not traditional , did n't grow up that way and have not lived that way ... however , a friend had this Elf and when I saw it and how much their kids love it I wanted one for my daughter and wanted to start this annual tradition . So glad I did . My daughter loves , Niko ( that 's what we named our elf ) and would wake up every morning looking for where he moved to during the night . Keeps the parents on your toes because you must remember to move the Elf every night . We love it and so glad we purchased it . When you register online you get an Elf letter and certificate and Santa talks to the kids via email . It 's really very cute and creative . The included book explains the story and tradition . Great find , and I recommend !	1
My nephew is having a blast with his elf . Every morning it is a thrill to see what his elf was up to the night before .	1
The Elf on the Shelf worked miracles with our granddaughter who was sure that the Elf was watching over her and reporting to Santa . She is 8 and still a believer . But to our grandson who is four , he just did n't warm to the idea of a miniature elf reporting back to Santa about his behavoir ! The book is lovely and both grandchildren loved it . It was also fun for our daughter and son-in-law to find a new place to put the Elf each night ! I would recommend this elf and book to anyone who has children or grandchildren who still believe in Santa . It may not make every child a lot better behaved but it is a lot of fun for them to try to find the Elf and wonder how it got to its new location each day . This is also an item that can be handed down from generation to generation which is another reason why we wanted to purchase it . By telling the children not to handle the Elf or it will lose its powers is a good way to keep the Elf in great condition . The set arrived very quickly after ordering which was a big plus as we ordered it in December .	1
I started the Elf on a Shelf tradition with my 7 and 4 year olds this year . It was a hit ! I loved that this elf has brown eyes ( like us ) . The price was comperable to everywhere else , and I recieved it pretty quick . The description says & # 34 ; dark skinned & # 34 ; and & # 34 ; brown eyed & # 34 ; but the skin tone is more olive and the eyes are brown . The elf looks just like our family ( we are Hispanic ) . Check out Pinterest for blogs and tips on moving the elf throughout the house overnight . He also has a Facebook page that offers free coloring pages , activity sheets , and more ideas on the elf 's overnight movement .	1
Really like this little brown elf . Kids seem to enjoy him and named him Carlos . Will be a great holiday tradition for many years to come ! ! ! ! ! !	1
This is our daughter 's very first Christmas and her elf will indeed appear on Thanksgiving Day . Since she is too young to understand we are going to take pictures each morning of her elf in a new location so we can make a book to show her over the years ! The book tells all about the elves and how important they are to Santa . Your child 's elf arrives on Thanksgiving and stays until Christmas Eve ( when Santa arrives and the elf goes home with him ) . Each night the elf flies back to Santa to report on your child 's behavior ~ the good and the not so good ; ) By the time the children awake the next morning the elf has returned ! They will have a blast finding their elf in a new location each morning.There is only one rule : Children can not touch the elf or it may lose its magic . The elf also ca n't talk , but rest assured - he ( or she ! ) hears every word . Their elf not only informs Santa of their behavior , but their hopes and dreams too.I also love the fact that the book has a Christian element to it as it refers to children saying their prayers each night . Do n't wait ! Start this Christmas tradition this year and start making memories that will last a lifetime.Lastly , since our elf is a girl we purchased the newly released skirtThe Elf on the Shelf Presents : The Claus Couture Collection Accessory Scout Elf Skirtand it is adorable and very high quality !	1
Someone told me about Elf on a Shelf earlier this year knowing how into Christmas I am ! This is a wonderful idea for parents who want to create a running dialogue with their kids about Christmas and all that goes into it.The book included with the elf tells the story of how Santa knows whether a child is naughty or nice by sending an elf to their home to report back to him each night . As a parent you can put the Elf somewhere and then your kids can play hide and seek to find him . They can also tell the Elf what they want for Christmas and how they would like Christmas to play out.It is easy to put a faith based element into your play and story as well as any other customs you may want to impart . The Elf makes the anticipation for Christmas more keen and kids enjoy playing hide and seek as well as talking to the Elf .	1
I ordered 3 , one for my daughters ' homes and one for our 's . So happy we can choose our own names for the Elf . Ca n't wait to begin this tradition . My oldest daughter has Charlie , and all the other cousins were jealous that her family had an elf in the house .	1
If you follow the directions and read the story , register the elf with your child present and move Santa 's helper nightly , this is a wonderful toy . Cynics will argue that we are getting children accustomed to the NSA with the Elf , but it 's still fun and can help with discipline .	1
The book that came along with the elf was perfect to explain the elf 's story , and our boys ( ages 3 and 5 ) immediately got into it . The elf is cute , although probably a bit expensive considering what it is . However , it was worth the price to start a fun tradition that made our boys rocket out of bed every morning to see what their elf had done overnight .	1
I personally do n't like the Elf on the Shelf . I do n't even like the idea of Santa . I do n't like pretending and lying to my kids , about anything , ever . 'This product is beautifully boxed with the elf and the book exactly as described , no problem there . So why do n't I like it ? Well ... the idea was thrust onto us by a relative [ sister-in-law ] when we were visiting Grandma 's one Thanksgiving and the day after , voila ! My sister-in-law 's kids had this & # 34 ; special elft & # 34 ; who appeared at Grandma 's house and they read the book , etc . My kids were crying because they did n't have an elf show up and proceeded to write letters and place them next to their cousin 's elf to take to Santa that night when he flew back to the North pole requesting that Santa send them an elf . Since they were 3 and 5 I did n't have the heart to tell my kids there 's no Santa much less any elf such as this.So here we are a few years later and I still have to get it out every year the day after Thanksgiving , no matter where we are in the country whether it be at home or visiting relatives ... yes , they like it . But it 's getting really old for us adults ... I 'm dying to give it away to some young couple with a toddler someday .	1
Our 9 nine year is a sucker for her magic elf - it has been so much fun . Very nice , sturdy box with cute posable felt elf with plastic face and beautiful book that tells the story of how the elf can become a part of your holiday fun .	1
Love this little guy , ... .I gave him as a present to My Son/Wife ... .they fell in love with him and will have lots of fun with him next christmas ! ... fast shipping wonderful packaging !	1
My grandsons love their new elf ! They are being very good for & # 34 ; Buddy & # 34 ; and Santa ! ! Very cute idea ! : ) highly recommend !	1
Doing this for my daughter was so much fun , in fact I do n't know who had more fun ? Me when moving the elf around or my daughter trying to find him in the morning .	1
This is the most fun thing I 've purchased is a very long time and most definitely a tradition that will be going in our home for many , many years to come . My children are still young and they believe in everything . My husband also loves this and has already came up with so much ideas . I think this elf has brought the kid in my husband and I 'm just so happy to be able to share it with my children . My children named our elf , Fred , and let me tell you , Fred is naughty at times but he is a fun elf . My kids look forward to each mornings and they search for Fred and see what mischievous deeds he has done around the house . Fred definitely does not disappoint . This product is most definitely worth it and a keeper for any family .	1
I ca n't wait for Thanksgiving to pass so I can introduce our family to our Elf ! I have two sons aged six and two and I really hope they will enjoy this family tradition . The enclosed book is great and will get us all in the Spirit of the Season . There are some very creative people who have posted great ideas on Pinterest about what their Elves were up to , and I ca n't wait to discover what our Elf will be caught doing !	1
I heard a lot of my friends talking about this book and was interested . It seemed a bit high in price to me , but we used a coupon and a gift card which made it seem more reasonable . My children loved the story and got so into it . We purchased it yesterday and this morning they were so excited to come downstairs to find Elfie ( our current name , we have n't decided for sure so I am waiting to record it in the book ) . It helped a bit with some behavior and fighting issues . Although the illustrations in the book were not quite as good as I had hoped for , the fact that my children love it and are having a good time with it makes up for that . i would recommend this book to people with small children .	1
We love this book/toy . My kids have so much fun every December morning racing around the house trying to find Elf first !	1
They were excited to see where the elf moved each day and what & # 34 ; trouble & # 34 ; or funny thing they did while they were sleeping . Fun tradition will do every year .	1
There are people who like the elf and those who do not , kind of like Christmas . This year the elf handlers in my family started preparing for the extra effort and the joy of the Elf on the Shelf . I found that my son does not really remember what he got for Christmas but he remembers the elf fishing for goldfish crackers and playing with toilet paper . After a few nights hiding on various shelves , Mom got bored and the crazy ideas circulating on the internet had her launching the elf into flour , setting up a marshmallow snow fort and various other shenanigans . I posted my crazy photos on Facebook and before I knew it the elf had a following . My son loved Chip the elf dearly and loved his crazy ideas but a few older adults with no kids who saw my posts said they really enjoyed waking up each morning to see a new surprise , including a friend who was going through major cancer treatments . You can make the tradition what you want and you can make your elf the creepy daunting vision you envisioned or you can have it turn the milk green , blame it for the pizza box you left in the living room and share it via e-mail with those afar to include them in your celebrations . Kids are little for just a short time , and this is a great way to extend the Christmas joy .	1
Got this for six year old boy , he LOVES it . The elfs name is Bluki ( we figured that out as a family , was a bit complicated but fun ) . It 's a bit of a chore moving him every night , just because sometimes we forget and have to scramble in the AM or come up with a reason why Bluki is in the same place ( he liked that spot , I guess ) . At 30 bucks it seems pretty expensive , but at least it 's going to be used for a couple more years and probably passed on to someone else by that time since it will stay in good shape . We place Bluki up high in different places around the house so our son ca n't get to him . He knows he 's not supposed to touch him so he does n't even ask or try . Bluki is now back in his box waiting till next year ... I mean , he 's back at the North Pole with Santa . There is n't much to the elf , but he 's very light and flexible which makes him easy to place in odd spots . It 's all just very cute and Christmasy and the little ones love it so I highly recommend .	1
Elf on the shelf is such a cute idea ! We have 3 and 6 year old boys who saw the promotional show ( sorry , ca n't make myself call a half hour promotional animation a movie ) last year and loved the concept- watched the show over and over . So we grabbed this guy during the summer this year when it was cheaper . Been pinning good ideas and ca n't wait to show them they have their own elf this year = )	1
Came as described . Box was a little bent but it was for our family and the $ 9.99 price could n't be beat . Cute Elf on the Shelf with blue eyes and book .	1
We started Elf on a Shelf last year and are really enjoying the tradition . My son is now 2 and a half and loves to find `` Simon '' every morning . The book that comes along with it is a great tool to help teach children about Santa Claus and the fun traditions of Christmas . This is something that we will use for many years .	1
We started the tradition this year with my children , ages 2 and 4 . They absolutely LOVE finding our elf , Martin , every morning . My husband and I laugh every night finding wild things for him to do . It is a great tradition that I know my children will cherish .	1
A friend at work told me about 'Elf on the Shelf ' and I figured I would give it a try . Had to read the book a number of times to my three year old as he immediately could not understand why he could not touch him but he finally understood and the weeks before Christmas were fun as the Elf magically appeared in different places in the house . And when we traveled he would appear as well . Great idea and keeps your child off the naughty list .	1
This was our first year with an elf . Our almost 3 year old loved it ! We had to explain a few things ( and a few times ) , but she picked up the concept and each morning when she woke up she went looking for our elf ! She liked how he was in a different spot each morning . I was a little worried about her touching the elf and wanting to play with him , so at first the elf was high and out of reach . As the days went on though and we quizzed her about the elf , she knew not to touch him and would get very upset if I went anywhere near him because she did n't want the elf to lose his magic ! So , I 'd say our elf is a success and a lot of fun to have around at Christmas . Our little girl is already thinking ahead to next year when the elf comes back !	1
We purchased our `` Elf '' after everyone was talking about it at preschool . Within hours we saw a huge improvement in the kids ' behavior ( We have a 4,3 and 1 year old ) It was n't long after having our little guy that the kids will look up anytime they think they are in trouble . My 4 year old goes out of her way to make the elf happy . When the kids are fighting they tell the elf what is going on . It really works ! ! The best part is how excited they are to find him in a new spot every morning . We read the book at least once every other day and have recently started watching the movie on the days we do n't read the book . My daughter is already worried about him leaving on Christmas Eve.I think it 's a great idea and it really works with our kids .	1
Our book and Elf arrived in our home on Thanksgiving and my daughter eagerly read the book and watched us put Elfin on our TV . She knew from the book that each night Elfin would fly to the North Pole and report to Santa . We never scared her with that if she disobeyed he 'd cancel Christmas , but said that he was watching her . Every morning she 'd come out of her room with a huge smile on her face searching for Elfin . She is looking forward to seeing him arrive at our home this next year ! I got 2 extras for gifts for friends and family and it was a huge hit in their home too !	1
Gave this as a gift to my niece and nephew at Thanksgiving , and they have LOVED it ! My nephew cried on Christmas eve because he would n't see Foodle again for nearly a year ! Their mom had to promise that he could drop in occasionally throughout the year to see how they were behaving . : )	1
I highly recommend The Elf on the Shelf . We have done it for 8 days now and my daughter loves waking up every morning and finding out where and what Joey the elf has done . I ca n't wait to carry on this tradition .	1
Loved it ! Too bad the Elf forgets some nights to move on a different shelf , oops ... Oh , and when the kids ask 'Mommy , why does the Elf has a tag on his back ? ' just answer with 'It says 'if found , return to the North Pole ! ''	1
I 'll admit , I like it , we have a 4 and 6 year old and they ate it up . It made Christmas really fun this year . Some drawbacks : 1 ) I got tired of telling them to be good because the elf would tell Santa ( do not let this replace real parenting ) .2 ) If you are a Christian like I am , you will need to bring the real message of Christmas into this story or it will overshadow it.3 ) Do n't forget to move the thing every night ! Sheesh , my kids thought the elf did n't move because they were so bad the day before , the elf could n't bear to tell Santa .	1
The elf on the shelf is a super cute idea but be aware it does take work ! My 8 year old and 4 year old understand the story and are very excited every morning to see where the elf ends up . My older daughter has asked those questions you would expect . The only thing I do n't like is for the kids on the fence ( believe or not believe ) I think that this could give some more doubt . Probably better for ages 3-6 years . I do wish I would have got it when they were younger .	1
Adorable little elf ! My children really enjoyed him , and the book that came with him . They actually wanted to go to bed at night so they could go search for & # 34 ; Rusty & # 34 ; in the morning . They were very sad to see him go back to Santa when Christmas was over . Very fun little Christmas game to play with your children , and a wonderful tradition to pass down to their children .	1
Gave this to my sister for my nephews . Hopefully it starts a Christmas tradition in her household . It 's fun watching the kids look for him in the morning !	1
My 4 y.o . daughter enjoyed this tradition very much . The book is quick , cute and catchy , and our elf ( affectionately named Eugene ) will be a favorite for Christmases to come . I 'm giving this 4 stars because I do wish he was a bit more pose-able , and I think $ 30 for a book and elf were a little steep .	1
We joined the crowds and bought one this year , he was a lot of fun to move around the house and do funny tricks . I wish his limbs were more pose able and stayed put more easily . But the storage box was very sturdy and I like that .	1
I got this for my grandchildren . I was unable to find one locally and I was delighted to locate one on line . It was a great price and it has been used for 3 Christmas ' already .	1
I ca n't say enough about this book and doll . I had days of fun moving it around the house for my grand children 's benefit . They enjoyed looking for the next place he was hidden . The story was read over and over by request , and it kept them on their best behavior knowing Santa 's elf was watching their every move . I ended up buying it from Barne 's and Noble , because after ordering from Amazon backed seller and being told I 'd receive it before Christmas , I received an email telling me I would get it until January 15th . Obviously too late for the holiday season . Amazon refunded my money without any issues .	1
Love it ! My granddaughter has so much fun with her Elf on the Shelf at her house , that I decided to get one for my house - when she comes to visit , we are going to have so much fun . This is so cute & fun , fun , fun ! !	1
I heard about the elf on the shelf by a coworker of mine . so i just had to get it for my daughters little family . she was so excited about that she ca n't wait for xmas next year to take the elf out .	1
Purchased this around Thanksgiving last year and my son ( age 4 ) LOVED 'elf ' - as he so creatively named it LOLeven now , in march , hes still talking about 'Elf'there were several times elf forgot to move , and we decided tht sometimes he liked a spot so much he stayed there a couple of days ! LOLi loved finding different ways to hide him - he hung upside down from our kitchen chandelier ... hid in xmas tree branches ... on top of the curtain rod ... even on top of the ceiling fan ! My son loved coming out to find him each morning !	1
We did this tradition for 2 years in a row now and it has become one of my kids most favorite things to look forward too .	1
I really like the story and the concept of the elf watching over them to see that they are good girls and boys . My kids also like waking up to try and find where the elf is hiding . However , at age 1 and 3 they screamed to hold the elf and I let them . So , they take turns holding the elf while I read the story . I see no point to adhere to that part of the story where the elf loses his magic if he is touched . My kids love taking turns playing with him like he is their little friend . However , they know that he will hide at night and that they must find him.With that minor tweak to the story it has become a wonderful Christmas tradition that i hope to continue . It is fun for me and my husband to brainstorm ideas of where the elf could hide each night . If you need ideas , check out Pinterest . There are loads of endearing and funny examples of places to place the elf . One that I have n't tried but that did make me laugh is where the elf is hanging from the toilet bowel and inside the toilet bowl is a floating candy cane colored small round candy ( meant to be a festive elf poop ) . If you have a sense of humor about it , you can really be creative about where to place the elf.The elf and the book have held up well over the past two Christmases . And my children really do behave better when I remind them that the elf is watching . I also think the elf is cute and do not get a scary vibe at all . In sum , I would recommend this book as a fun Christmas tradition .	1
This was a Thanksgiving present for my 4 yr old grandson . We read the book , talked about the Elf 's `` job '' and he was all set to help ! My son said it was an adventure every day seeing where the Elf would be sitting in the morning . One of the best things I bought this year on Amazon . Want to enjoy Christmas more ? Get the Elf for the kids !	1
I bought this for my grandchildren and they really enjoyed finding the elf each day and seeing what it was up too . My three year old granddaughter would call me and let me know . I think it is a cute idea .	1
This was a really good buy . The stores in my area had all sold out and this was the only place I could find this set	1
The book and doll are fun and my son loves waking up to find out what his elf , Dog Dog , has in store for him . The first name the kid picks is supposed to be the Elf 's name for life , in case you are wondering what kind of name that is . In any case , it 's a fun story and a tradition the whole family has enjoyed .	1
This is so much fun for the kids around the holidays . Our kids have named our Chippy and they look forward to finding him each and every morning . We love it !	1
This is a hardbound story book that explains how Santa relies on The Elf on the Shelf as a type of scout . Once your Elf on the Shelf is adopted and named , it is granted its magical powers and truly becomes part of your family as it travels back and forth to the North Pole , telling Santa about the day 's activities . When The Elf on the Shelf returns from the North Pole each morning , it finds a new place to sit and spend the day . Kids will love waking up each morning during the holiday season to see where The Elf on the Shelf is ! There are only two rules : The Elf on the Shelf must never be touched ; and The Elf on the Shelf will not move or speak when anyone is watching it -- its job is to watch and listen .

We started this tradition this past Christmas . He showed up when the tree did . My husband declared it the creepiest thing he 'd ever seen but my girls , 4 and 2 LOVED looking for him every morning . It would be nice if he had some metal bendable wires to help him hold onto things . Hes top heavy too . Many mornings I had to readjust him because he had fallen over .	1
We have 5 grandkids and I could n't resist buying an elf for them . It is such a cute tradition for a family . It is fun to see where they will put him to watch over the kids . I highly recommend it for parents or grandparents !	1
This has been a blast with my grand child . She had so much fun waking up with him in a different spot everyday . I highly recommend it !	1
I bought this to have while my grandchildren were here . They arrived several days before Christmas . They chose to name him Scottie , after Poppy who 's middle name is Scott . Every morning he would show up in a new place ; - ) As soon as they woke up they would begin their search for Scottie . Since he loses his magic if he 's touched , I would place him out of reach to remove the temptation to test that theory , lol . We all had so much fun with Scottie that I am looking forward to his return from the North Pole next year . Your Elf will come with a book to read to the children which explains his presence and purpose .	1
Was recommended by many co-woker , s and this product is great . grand kids are all excited and watch for the elf each morning to see where he has moved . It is both the book and the elf included .	1
My husband ran across Elf on the Shelf on Amazon and decided to get it and start a new tradition for our son 's first Christmas . Although my son is only 5 months old and does n't understand the tradition yet , he still gets really excited when he sees the elf in a new location everyday . And he loves looking at the great illustrations in the book . I think this will be a wonderful tradition that we will continue for years to come .	1
My 22 month old loves looking for her elf every morning . I love that the story says they ca n't touch him ... so she never asks because she knows she 's not supposed to . It 's a cute story and idea and I look forward to doing it for years to come .	1
This just seems like one of those instant classic toys . We starting using the Elf on the Shelf last year after our kids were asking about why we did not get an elf and so-and-so does . Within days it felt like we had been using the elf toy for years . Our children enjoy the hunt each morning , especially if Elf has been mischievous during the night . This always brings out big laughs . It does not take much effort to find a place for Elf to be each morning . No worries if Elf decides to stay put two days in a row ... it must be a comfortable spot . Notably , Elf 's legs have creases to bend , but the arms do not . That said , you can fold the arms , they just do not have creases built in .	1
HOW IT WORKS : The kit comes with an elf doll and a book . The book explains that Santa has sent an elf to watch over the children and the elf reports back to Santa each night . The kids get to decide the name for the elf together - this is a touch decision ! You read through the book with your child , it explains all the rules , then each night you move the elf to a new spot . One of the rules is that the children can not touch him - this is a great rule because although he 's a sturdy doll , I think he might get loved out much too quickly if they were allowed ! The author was so thoughtful to think of all these helpful rules.Rules : * The children can not touch the elf or he will lose his magic* The elf can listen to what the children tell him , but can not talk back , that 's Santa 's law . * The elf flies back to the North Pole each night and tells Santa what he has seen - when he comes back he goes to a new spot in the house.The kids start searching for the elf immediately when they wake up ! Knowing Santa is watching has definitely motivated them to be a behave a bit better ! This cute little tradition makes the Christmas season more fun . It 's a very special tradition in our house . I love that the book has an old fashioned feel to it , the illustrations are wonderful.CONS : * Your children will ask you every night from Halloween to Thankgiving when the elf is coming back ! * You have to remember to move the elf every night ! Sometimes this is a bit of a challenge for us . : ) However , our elf does sometimes just get comfy in the spot he 's in , so he must have decided to come back to the same spot .	1
I purchased 5 of these for my family . They loved reading the story to their kids and enjoying the memories of the elf	1
Great concept for those who have children 3-7 years old that still believe . Even gives parents excitement of being able to find unique locations on a nightly basis . Great invention ! !	1
My 11 yo nephew was wide-eyed as he dramatically told me how it was & # 34 ; proven & # 34 ; that the elf moved , etc . After that , I could n't not buy it for him for Christmas . He was so excited when he opened it ! I read through the book ( which I thought was pretty goofy , but if the kids like it , then who am I to judge ? ) and it at least explained the whole concept . I know many people think that this elf idea is creepy , but I have seen so many who have had fun with it , too . It seemed to be well made , and the boxed-set made it a wonderful presentation for gift-giving .	1
My two-year old loves the Elf ! Great story and tradition and it 's definitely going to remain a part of our family for years to come !	1
This is going to be fun during the wait for Santa ! The grand kids will enjoy the fun things we have found to do with him	1
I got this for our daughters baby shower . They have now used it and his name is Unhuh . Thats what the baby said when they asked him his name . Great fun and a nice tradition to start .	1
Received this as a Christmas gift when our son was born . It is a great family tradition . The elf and the book are fun to share with our year old . He enjoys looking for the elf each day when he is placed around the house . The elf is not very sturdy , but it is not meant to be played with .	1
This is for my grandson . He has not received it yet . He will get next year . My daughter , who is a teacher , will love reading the book to him .	1
I think the idea behind the Elf is wonderful . My daughter is 18 months and when she wakes up I say `` Where is your elf ? '' and she goes looking and points to it . The book says you ca n't touch them because they will lose their magic . My daughter has n't wanted to hold it or anything , because she never has . I think the plush version will confuse kids if you have both , being able to hold one and not the other . I do n't tell her the elf is watching her when she is bad , and I wo n't ever tell her that even when she is older . I think this is perfect as a family tradition if the parents do n't use it to control their children.The Elf itself is made from cloth and the face is plastic ( I thought it was porcelain or something and was scared of it falling ) so if a cat knocks it down overnight it 's no big deal . The book is very long , and I do n't think we 're going to include it as part our tradition . I 'm just going to tell her my own version every Christmas and hopefully that will make it a little more our own . The entire thing comes in a very nice box , and the book is hard cover and nice so I believe it is worth the money .	1
2012 was the first year for my husband and I to introduce & # 34 ; Gumdrop & # 34 ; to our girls . My soon-to-be 4 year old keeps asking when Gumdrop is coming back to visit . This was an awesome little Christmas tradition I 'm so thrilled to be starting with my 3 girls . In the book there is a spot to write when you adopted your Elf and their name !	1
I am so looking forward to doing this with my son ! Last year in school they had an elf on the Shelf for the classroom . I love the rules my son seriously explained to me after class one day . I plan on giving it to my son for his birthday , even if it is a couple months early I hope he enjoys it .	1
I had waited for this until I could get it on sale . I cant wait until this fall and use this in December with my 3 year old .	1
She named ours 'Nelf ' the Elf . I know , not too crazy , but hey , she 's two . But it 's so much fun to read the book to her and then move Nelf all over the house everyday and have him get into some mischief . Sometimes I forget about him when my wife hides him until my daughter comes running in to tell me she found him . It 's a lot of fun for everyone . The book is well written and it 's going to be a great tradition for years . If you love your kids , get the Elf on the Shelf . But just do n't name him Nelf . Thats already taken .	1
This item was perfect . It was for my daughter for the upcoming holidays and she loves it . She loves finding him each morning . Thanks for such a great product and shipping was perfect .	1
First child received one when they first came out as a gift ... Had to buy one for our 2nd child because they had so much fun ... Like that they changed up the eyes and skin color so each child has a unique one ... Plus now it is more fun that there are 2 to get in trouble ..Kids love them and they are almost 9 and 3 ...	1
I sent this to my garndchildren , ages 5-7 and they loved it and their mother had fun with it all ! A new FUN tradition for Christmas !	1
Bought the girl edition , but they are almost identical . I really do n't see a difference between the two ones so I am reviewing this one too.I guess I did n't get it last year when I looked at the price tag and placed this back on the self , because my daughter came home every day between thanksgiving and christmas break and would always talk about her class 's elf . Which would play tricks on the class every night , how the teacher read them this book , how the elf was their to watch over them , and sometimes cause trouble . So I went to the store and took one look at the doll and was creeped out . I 'm a man in his 30 's and I do n't scare easily but I thought the thing looked about as menacing as a christmas elf could ever look . So I said no thank you to spending 30 dollars to what I thought would guarantee my daughters nightmares . The wife and I compromised and bought the much sweeter looking Target special edition one that acts as a stuffed plush more than the one in the box and used it on christmas morning as if the elf helped leave clues to a scavenger hunt to where in the house to find the lego table `` santa '' brought . That thing was such a hit my daughter , she would sleep with it every night . As the next year came back around my daughter right away asked for the book , which we had avoided before . Reluctantly we took that journey and bought this book set . I think the price could be lower , but I must say a night has n't gone by since thanksgiving that she has n't read her little sitter the book . And since we are using the elf and moving it around secretly while the girls are sleeping , they run eagerly to seek for the elf every morning . Soon we will be mixing things up like using two tea pitchers to help swap the milk and orange juice in the others jug , thus blaming it on the elf . Half of the value of the book and doll is what you make out of it . I would never pay this much for a book you read once a year . But as an investment of an ongoing tradition I have less regretted the price . I was a little disappointed the girl elf lacked real difference than the boy . Considering we went to two stores to find the girl one . I could of saved the gas and settled with the boy elf and doubt they would tell any difference . I ca n't believe how much my daughters both eat this up . It 's like Santa got downsized and replaced by an elf . I can totally stand behind this product , if you have young kids . There was a time as a parent fresh out of college money was very tight and if this was 5 years ago I would be copping this by using a cheaper plush elf . So as a parent who has in my early year borrowed money to buy christmas for the kids I get how this can be pricey , but if you can afford this the reactions of the kids are magical and well worth it .	1
I had never heard anything about this tradition until this year . My kids are 1.5 , 3 and 5 and they love their elf Dexter . I highly recommend purchasing the Elf on the Shelf DVD or Blu ray with this because the DVD went into depth about how the elves get shipped to the house and why they are there . For younger kids , it helps them understand the whole thing way more so it is not creppy to them . The elf doll is so cute and the box it comes in is awesome looking . The book has its own slot inside the box . It is absolutely the funnest tradition . My husband and I had a blast moving the elf to different places each night and having him do different activities . I do not however do the naughty elf things like other people do ... I do n't think it 's a good message to send your kids . We did fun things like have the elf play Connect Four with our nut cracker man ... eat a candy cane from the tree ... have him decorating the tree . The look on there faces every morning when they went to look for Dexter was just priceless . I can not wait until next year now .	1
The elf on the shelf tradition is so cute ! Our 5 year old really enjoyed looking for our elf every morning . The book explaining how the elf came to be at the house is very helpful .	1
This is a cute little felt scout elf who is found on various shelves in your home each morning . He supposedly reports to Santa about the children 's behavior . Nice hardcover story book & an online registration .	1
arrived the other day , grand-kids opened it and we read them the story , they named their elf and now his is watching over them . They are one their best behavior . Fun new tradition	1
I bought this for my son this year . It is so much fun ! The book is the perfect way to introduce the elf to the kids and the elf is so cute ! I 've had a lot of fun moving the elf each night to a new location and my son ca n't wait to see what he 's up to when he wakes up in the morning . I would recommend this to any parent looking for a fun family tradition .	1
We had a male elf and needed a female so this was exactly what we needed . The girls love their elves .	1
Very pretty . This is the skirt the Elf appeared with in our Christmas Tree . My daughter jumped up and down like crazy when she saw we had an Elf like her friends . Truly a great idea .	1
Purchased for my grand daughters along with the elf on the shelf . Works great to make the boy elf a girl elf .	1
I am very impressed with the quality of this skirt ; it is very well made . This is our seven month old daughter 's first holiday and her elf just arrived tonight on Thanksgiving Eve . We added this skirt and other accessories of our own to personalize her a bit more . She now has a pom-pom on her hat , a bow , and even pearl earrings ! She looks so sweet ! I uploaded a picture ... check it out : ) I highly recommend the skirt if your elf is a female . It really adds something special to this already spectacular elf ! Happy holidays : )	1
Very cute and well made . Fits elf perfectly . Could cost a little less for what you get but it was worth it to have a `` girl '' elf for my little princess . Would have given it 5 stars if more reasonably priced .	1
The elves in the movie had this style skirt , and my daughter wanted one for her elf . Fits perfectly , and it very cute	1
Close friends of ours had a & # 34 ; Elf on the Shelf & # 34 ; which our daughters fell in love with . I did my & # 34 ; Amazon & # 34 ; research and found a girl elf . This little skirt was a perfect addition to the elf . ( I was very happy when Christmas Eve arrived and & # 34 ; Snowflake & # 34 ; went back to the North Pole ! )	1
This skirt is super cute . Our daughter was so excited to see her elf with a skirt and was happy she came back to visit with it . Fit the elf great and even went well with the red body .	1
We opted to start this tradition last year , when our daughter turned 4 , but waited until now to get her skirt . We also bought an additional male elf this year for our son ( who will only be about 16 months for Christmas this year ) , and truly love the fun they bring , and the good behavior they encourage ! : ) The skirt is very sweet on our female elf , Twinkle . : )	1
I thought it would be a good idea to have the elf wear different skirts , we 'll see if my daughter notices .	1
I was going to make my own , but decided to just buy it . I 'm very glad I bought it . The skirt is made with the same material as the elf , so it fits texture and colors perfectly . It also fits very well . I recommend for all girl elves !	1
This fits perfectly . Put all the angry reviews aside and choose for yourself . I shopped around to find the best deal . The elf that comes with the book looks nothing like a girl . This skirt helps fix that . The doll kinda looks creepy without it . This might be what prevents screams in terror . I was worried my kids would be scared of the doll after the first time I saw it for myself . The skirt softens the creep factor . Considering how many stories I hear of kids being terrorfied of the bow elf doll . This should be considered . We bought this and one other design and my girls love their adopted elf	1
Fun game ! your friends will love it ! I plan on getting all the expansions for this game ! its a must for zombie fans !	1
So far , I 've only played this game with two players , but the mechanics seem like playing with more wo n't change how it feels , other than adding more people to enjoy it with.It 's really great fun . If you 're playing zombies , you have to consider risk-reward for splitting up your zombies or grouping them up . Do you try surrounding buildings , or block off the survivor 's goal ? If you 're a survivor , do you take another turn to dig for a weapon , or do you hope that the bat you have is enough ? Very nice mix of skill and luck . Placement and movement choices matter , but even perfect planning can be ruined by terrible luck with the dice.Replay seems high . The base game alone has five scenarios with different goals for the survivors ( zombie goals are pretty much always the same : go eat people ) . Additional scenarios are on the game company 's website for free , and you can get even more scenarios with the add-ons and expansion packs . Or make up your own . With loads of tokens , I can imagine loads of ways to invent your own goals.Before I bought the game , I saw reviews saying one way or another that either the survivors or the zombies were `` overpowered . '' That does n't seem to be the case . If each are played to their strengths , they can both be viable sides to play on . In one play through , I as a zombie ate a survivor before any of my zombies were killed . On another play through , my survivors used speed to manuever around the board , shooting ranged weapons to push back the zombie hordes.Looking forward now to pulling a few friends in to play act a little humans versus zombie action !	1
Played a few games now with my 11yr old ; the zombies spawn quickly and takes a while to build tactics to survive . This is a great looking game , does take a little while to setup and requires a solid 1 to 1.5hrs of play . Lots of replay value and fun scenarios too .	1
Last Night On Earth : 2-6 Players , Ages 12+ , Average Play Time = 60 MinutesIt 's easy to see that a lot of time and effort was put into making the components . The pictures on the cards and character sheets are thematic and highly detailed . I 'm not an expert on production and special effects , but it looks like actors got dressed up to take these pictures ... whether this is or is n't the case , it still looks impressive . I 've also never had a board game come with an official soundtrack before , which admittedly , I have yet to listen to.Playing as the zombie player , I often found myself just going through the motions without having to think about it . Since I only moved one space per zombie , the only real strategy I had to consider was which card to play when and deciding whether or not I wanted to discard a card.The heroes on the other hand , had a lot more to think about . Vinnie Jr. and Anthony Jr. were careful about their movement , trying to land on spaces away from the zombies but just within the range of their current ranged weapons . To use a gaming term , they were `` kiting '' , which takes a bit of thought . They also had to consider what cards they had in their hand and what items they were currently carrying . In the scenario we were playing , `` Die Zombies , Die ! `` , they were racing against the clock to find enough weapons to dispose of fifteen zombies before sundown . Interaction between the two was a lot more involved , I felt , though I could see where two zombie players would need to coordinate their card plays.Since I was in the position to control the difficulty level , I found myself in the role of dungeon / game master once more . I like being able to hold back or play aggressively as I need to so that the kids have a positive gaming experience . The game ended in the kids ' favor on track turn three ( starting from fifteen going down ) . I managed to wound their characters a total of three or four times , but they healed themselves straight away . I imagine that in order for the zombies to win , you have to be able to surround them en masse ... which makes sense.Based on what we 've played so far , the boys and I had a lot of fun , though all of us were biased from the start as we enjoy a good zombie movie / game . I imagine that this game would appeal to other zombie fans as well . We have yet to try the other scenarios , but I 'm sure we 'll get around to it . I also own the expansion which I will probably cover sometime down the line , so keep an eye out !	1
I got this game for an addition to my ever expanding game closet . We sat down to play the game and OMG the instruction booklet was huge . It took quite a while to go through and understand all the rules , so I would n't say this is a game that you can be & # 34 ; up and playing & # 34 ; quickly . That is the only reason I did n't give it 5 stars.That being said , the game construction is awesome , the pieces are sturdily built and look great . When we finally got to the point of actually Playing , the game was a lot of fun and was enjoyed by the whole family . We played 2 scenarios back to back and had a blast.Overall I am glad I bought it and look forward to trying some of the many expansions to this game . Just be forewarned , if you have never played this game , plan on spending some time with the rule book , ( we referenced it many , many times during the games ) . Otherwise , enjoy ! !	1
This is definitely the best zombie game out . I really like the coop nature of this game ( even though one person does have to be the zombies ) , and once you learn the rules ( which can be very long and daunting the first time you play ) the game flows well . The only thing bad about this game is that most of your strategy ( other than just killing the zeds and trying to stay alive ) will be dictated by the cards you draw while looting , which is largely based on luck . So , sometimes the game will be extremely hard ( if you draw and roll like crap ) OR , sometimes you will wipe the zeds out with no problem at all . Either way , I still think the game is really fun , and it even comes with an immersive cd with spooky tunes to get your game on .	1
Let me start off by saying I was very cautious about this game . Not because I do not enjoy zombies or the somewhat gory cards , but because it is made by a company I am unfamiliar with . That being said , can I say how surprised I was when I opened the game box . The quality of the pieces are the best I have seen in any game I have . The cards have a lament over them to protect them better , and the cardboard was not warped , and it is high quality.That being said the gameplay is amazing . I started out by controlling the zombies , and this was a learning curve for me . There are different quests the humans will embark upon , and depending on what they have , you want to be careful with what you do ! There is a game soundtrack , and I honestly hope this trend catches on to other games , it sets the mood and just adds a different element to be enjoyed in the game.This game is very different from the Zombies ! ! ! game I picked up after , and both are great , id recommend this game to any fan of co-op games . It is fun to work with , and against , your friends as you try to complete your objectives.With that being said , just remember if you pick up this game , it is about zombies , there are some gory images on the cards , nothing to bad , but just to keep in mind if that is something that may be a concern to you or any of the players . Just a heads up but enjoy the game if thats not an issue and have fun~	1
Well , I 've been playing LNOE for over a year now with a pretty big variety of people . Since my first play , I have gained a lot of respect for the game and the way it plays . Here 's some thoughts on that : Gameplay - I 'll only touch briefly on the basic game concepts here . Some players play as zombies , others as heroes on a board made of randomly chosen L squares around a center board . This means that the layout of the town is a little different during each game . Also , the game comes with several different scenarios that outline the victory conditions for each side . This helps make it so the game is a little different each time . Usually the hero players are trying to accomplish a specific goal ( leaving town , saving townsfolk , etc . ) and the zombie player ( s ) are trying to stop them . There is conflict ( melee and ranged ) , but no player is ever eliminated from the game ( though his original hero might be ) .Components - The game comes with several boards and a ton of minis ( 14 zombies and one for each hero ) . It also comes with a lot of punch-out chits for different things . The components are well made and durable ( mine still look great after a year ) . The minis are well detailed , though they are not painted . The cards have an interesting art style based on actual pictures . I think they do a great job capturing the b-movie style of the game.Theme - As mentioned , this is a b-movie sort of game . The cards and quotes lend themselves to being both horror and comedy . In short , it 's a game that does n't take itself too seriously , and I like that . For the most part , I do think that the gameplay feels consistent with the theme . There are some exceptions , but very few things will pull you out of the experience.Fun - Alright . As far as I 'm concerned this is the one that really matters . Is the game fun , and why ? Firstly , this is a game that is about theme and conflict . That may turn some people off , but that 's some of what I like most about it . The first time I played LNOE I played the 'Die Zombie Die ' scenario as the instructions recommend . My friends and I had to consult the instructions pretty often since situations will come up that reqiure some specificity . The scenario for this play was just for the heroes to defeat a certain number of zombies before time ran out . To be honest , our initial reaction was absolutely 'meh . ' 'Die Zombie Die ' felt slow , unthematic , and predictable . To be honest , we did n't play again . But then I got a copy of the game for Christmas from my wife , so of course we had to give it another shot.It became pretty clear that the first time people played LNOE , they generally were n't too excited . For the first-time player , the game often feels lopsided in balance and somewhat predictable ( especially if you use the DZD scenario ) . What became clear , however , is that when people gave the game a second chance it got much more interesting . The more you play the game , the more you begin to see a deeper level of strategy than you first suspected . The games get more interesting , and they get closer.At the start , myself and the other players felt sure that the game was misblanaced towards the zombie player . It always felt like that person won . Over time , however , we started to get better and the win ratio began to balance itself out ( it stands now at right about 50/50 since we started keeping an actual record ) .All in all , I think LNOE is a game that should be played at least a couple of times to really judge . The more familiar with the game your players are , the more likely you 'll have a close , suspensful game . You 'll certainly still have a lopsided victory or two ( luck demands it ) , but it will even out over time.Luck - I 've heard the complaint several times that luck plays a bigger role than skill in LNOE . That may be a valid statement . A bad roll on an attack or movement can absolutely lose the game for a team . For me , that adds to the uncertainty and suspense of a game . Sure , it frustrates me when the dice do n't seem to go my way , but I can live with that . If you prefer games with little or no chance element , this probably is n't the game for you.Expansions - This review is just for the base game , so I wo n't touch much on individual expansions . I felt , however , that I should at least mention it . As you can see on the main BGG page , LNOE has quite a few available expansions . While you might be interested in some more than others ( or even none at all ) , it 's a nice perk because they can really add some variety to the game . On top of that , there are several scenarios also available on the LNOE website for free . I myself have Growing Hunger and Survival of the Fittest . I like how much variety that gives me , so that we can play several games of LNOE in a sitting and not feel like we 've plaed the same game over and over.To sum up , I think LNOE is a highly enjoyable , very thematic game . It sees a lot of play with my group , and I 'm really glad I gave it a second chance .	1
Unlike many board games that get repetitive and you only play once in a blue moon this game has quite a bit of replay value . While the cost of the game is fairly steep there is a lot of content inside the box.The game board is modular so there is a `` town center '' piece that you can put 4 L shaped pieces around . In advanced scenarios you can use all the pieces ( putting Ls together to make squares ) . You can flip the town center over to reveal a mansion for a defend your base style game . There is a truck piece that can be used for a scenario where the heroes need to find gas and keys to drive the truck out of town . There are additional pieces as well for future scenarios or to create your own.You have figurines for all 8 heroes , 14 zombies , a CD soundtrack to add to the experience , and plenty of dice , wound markers , etc . My only complaint about the content is the dice included ( I think there are 16 ? ) are small and do n't have the same feel as a normal dice . Dice are cheap so it is not a big deal to replace those.After reading the rules a few times it all makes sense but it can be a little overwhelming for first time players . The zombies go first . A zombie can move 1 tile at a time . Zombies must move to attack adjacent heroes since zombies have an urge to feed on humans . Each turn you roll a dice and if the number on the dice is larger than the number of zombies in play you can get more . At the end of the turn you roll the dice again to determine how many zombies to spawn ( Its a D3 roll so 1-2 is 1 , 3-4 is 2 , and 5-6 is 3 zombies ) .Heroes roll the dice and go that many spaces . A hero if inside a building can search which allows them to draw a Hero card ( more on this shortly ) .Fighting occurs when hero ( es ) and zombie ( s ) occupy the same tile . The hero and zombie players roll dice , typically 2 for the hero and 1 for the zombie . If the zombie player 's dice roll is equal or higher than the hero the hero takes a wound . If the player rolls doubles and its higher than the zombie roll the zombie dies . If the hero rolls higher but not doubles then the zombie is fended off but does n't die.If you understand that then the rest of this builds on that . Each zombie player can draw 2 cards ( 4 if there is a single player acting as the zombies ) at the start of their turn . These are cards that cause problems for the heroes such as heavy rain which limits players to moving 1 space . They can also be cards that allow the zombie to roll more dice or the hero to re-roll dice.Heroes get hero cards by searching buildings instead of moving which give them things to help in combat . One such card is a ranged weapon which can be used each turn in addition to melee combat . With weapons you roll to see if they hit and then to see if the break ( run out of gas , ammo , etc ) . If you have a hero card for ammo or gas you can discard it to keep the weapon.Lastly heroes have special abilities listed on their cards which give each one an advantage . Some have extra wounds they can take , some can take 2 hero cards when searching and choose which one to keep , etc.Its covered on each scenario card but the game can be won or lost several different ways . The basic scenario is to kill 15 zombies . Each zombie turn there is a numbered board called the `` sun tracker '' which is counted down so you may have 15-17 rounds most scenarios to win as the heroes or the zombies win . Zombies can also win if they play a card that exhausts the cards in the hero deck . However the heroes can exhaust their deck on their own with no penalty . Then obviously you can win by completing the stated objective.If you have friends ( or even just 1 friend ) who like zombies and like board games then you 'll enjoy this game .	1
A lot of fun for you zombie-lovers out there . We really enjoyed that this game allows for opposing teams of players , rather than using an every-man-for-himself system . We 've only played it vanilla so far , with 3 to 5 players , and it 's incredibly enjoyable . You kind of have to pay attention to details , but not so much that you ca n't kick back with a couple brews while you play . Not too difficult for younger players.Honestly , my only gripe is all the female characters are hot ( with comically ridiculous porn-esque makeup and costumes ) , but there 's no male eye-candy !	1
This is an amazing game for any Zombie enthusiast . First of all I have only played one other board game and that is ZOMBIES ! ! ! . Now that is a good game but this one truly blows that one out of the water ! First of all you get these sturdy game pieces and lovely plastic miniatures , secondly you can choose different types of scenarios that change up the game ... think of it as choosing a different zombie horror movie and lastly it is encouraged that you make your own scenario . They supply you with extra pieces so you can modify any scenario or make your own . The rules do take a game or two to finally master , but once you have got it down its all fun and mayhem afterwards .	1
I love tabletop board games & zombies , so this is a great fit . The theme of the game is loads of fun if the people you play with get into character . However , after many plays it is clear that the zombies are too tough & usually win . The heroes are also limited to once action each turn , which can be quite frustrating . I 've had to introduce a couple of `` house rules '' in order balance out the game . ( Heroes always get a free movement action , but may either search or use range weapons once each turn ) . Overall , it 's a solid game and much better than say , `` The Walking Dead '' or `` Zombiecide '' board games.If you would like to see a fun youtube video of it being played by Wil Wheaton & guests , check out : [ ... ]	1
I 'd say no board gaming/zombie movie enthusiast 's collection is complete without this andZombies . Although they share a theme , they each have their own flavor of zombie movie . I 'd say LNoE feels more like an 80s tongue in cheek zombie movie with the teens and purposely cheesy heroes , while Zombies ! ! feels more like the classic , overwhelming number of walking dead in Romero films . This one is easily the more complex and deeper of the two , so if you had to get one , I 'd say go with this one , but zombies gets credit for creating the claustrophobic feeling of being surrounded and feeling hopeless . I 've played this one a few times now , and while the basic rules are great to get you started , it gets even more fun with the advanced rules , and they 're not that much more complicated . I 'd say you 're ready for them after a couple of basic level games . There are a good number of scenarios to choose from and with one side playing zombie and the other heroes , there 's definitely a lot of replay value . The pieces are great quality for a board game and the cards are well done too , and can sometimes even being pretty funny as in being stuck in a location with a hero of the opposite sex while you share a `` let 's at least have tonight '' moment . The accompanying CD gets a bad rap from reviewers but I thought it added to the feel , and hey how many games give you a free CD of music to set the mood ? ( Also found adding some dark classical or 80s goth does a good job of this ) The rules can feel a little clunky at times , but it works very well . It feels balanced despite players going by different mechanics . An incredibly fun game that will leave every player feeling as satisfied as getting some fresh BRAAAAAINS ! nomnomnom	1
This is a very fun game that has many different versions to play in the basic set . It also has expansion sets available for it . Our friends always ask for us to bring it over , and the other fun thing is that there are difficulty settings for it to make it easier or harder for both zombies and survivors ! Highly recommended !	1
One theme that ages like a fine wine in board gaming is mall survival , and this game is one of those that does the idea justice . Easy to use but not too easy to master , it takes the novice player and gives them a platform to play from and also adds in more complex rules for people that have played the game a time or ten so they can have fun as well . That has to be commended in boardgames because being able to replay a game and not have the same experience is , well , odd.I liked one of the other reviewers and what they had to say on the product , talking about the feel of the game and how the turns can really draw out the ambiance you really want from something of this nature . When you , as a player , find yourself scavenging a building for something to use and then find yourself surrounded by an army of the crawling dead - it has more `` boomph '' than you 'd figure . If you have a good group and a keen sense of description then it really has the ability to get under the skin.Combine these features with the fact that you can take the already-existing set-up and create something new and you have an interesting take on something that is fun to do ; the rules are designed to let you take the map and turn it into something more engaging if you feel the need to make your own mall of dread and I like that feeling of fluidity . It makes for a good experience with an ever-changing terrain ( if you want the experience to become more complex ) .All in all , this is a good buy and shows how much the games have been growing . This and a few other games have shown just how creative the idea has become and how much people enjoy the idea of zombies and trying to survive and onslaught.Just add players .	1
Great games	1
Last Night on Earth : Growing Hunger is an expansion for the Last Night on Earth game . I love it because it is so much fun ! My friends and I get together once a month for game night and this is one we always pull out . This expansion add heroes , props , locations and scenarios to the main game . You do need the main Last Night on Earth board game for this add on to help you in any way . If you would like to know more about the main game there is a video on you tube from Wil Wheaton on his tabletop gaming blog style show called & # 34 ; TableTop & # 34 ; they played last night on earth https : //www.youtube.com/watch ? v=UhLU2-BuhMIIts a great explanation of the game and how it works ! However I took it to the next level and I hand painted my hero figures . I will post the images .	1
It 's a good expansion for a good game . I do n't know what else to write so I 'm finishing with filler .	1
A worthy expansion to the original game , adding new characters , cards , scenarios , and lots and lots of extra components for building your own scenarios and adventures . For me , thats the big difference between owning just the game and this expansion : whether or not you intend to make your own scenarios or just play the ones that come with the game . If you are one of those `` game tinkerers '' like me , then you will love this expansion .	1
I 'll keep it pretty short . If you 're considering the expansion , I would hope you already own Last Night on Earth . I think LNOE is a great game that offers suspense , teamwork , competition , and usually a lot of laughs . This expansion does not change much . What it does do is add some more locations ( in the form of some new L-shaped boards ) , some new characters , new hero and zombie cards , and a few new scenarios . On top of that , it comes with new game pieces that are used with the free scenarios available on the games ' official website or that can be used to design your own scenarios.In short , this expansion does not reinvent the wheel . What it will do , however , is help expand and reinvigorate an already great game . It 's a little pricey , but if you like LNOE , it 's a good investment .	1
The is a great game expansion to the game last night on earth , its very fun and different i highly recommend this add on . love the new game pieces	1
Nice big expansion to a replayable modular game , adding more modules for the game , more characters , more zombies , more scenarios , always good for a laugh .	1
I love this game because it is a copperative game that helps children learn how to play together . The pieces are fun and colorful and durable . My child could play this over and over and not get tired of it . Great game ! ! ! I would recommend this game !	1
I 've been running a daycare for 18 years , and while this is a fulfilling job ( I 'm told ) , it tends to get boring after year two . Then I purchased the Speedy Diner Game , and life suddenly became worthwhile and fun ! This toy is best combined with any Gordon Ramsay DVD . I sit the kids down to watch the DVD first , then bring out the game . I also tinkered with the timer so the kids have half the allowed time to prepare and deliver their food . Oh , and I am ALWAYS the customer . The very loud , demanding customer . I also taught my pet parrot Bunkotillo to scream `` BUGS IN THE KITCHEN '' at 30-second intervals which brought new meaning to the word `` frenetic '' .If you are a dedicated childcare professional , you will take the extra time to collect real bugs to add to the authenticity of the game . I keep cockroaches in a jar hidden in my purse , and let them out just before my meal arrives.They were SO right when they said this game serves up big laughs . Just picture adorable little kitchen tyrants shoving food at stressed-out waiters who are screaming and slapping roaches off their little aprons . Kids can just be SO funny !	1
This is a really fun game which gets you and your kids moving scrambling all over the place serving food like your in a real diner . Every time we play it , we have a blast !	1
My 3 , 5 and 8 year old kiddos all like this game and can play it successfully together . It 's never the same twice so that is a plus ! Only issue is the `` menu '' . If the card goes in crooked it gets jammed and it 's a bugger to get out . Also , if you accidentally pass the starting point you have to click BUNCH of time to get back tot he beginning . no big deal though . Still one of our favorites !	1
We bought this game for our 6 year old son for his birthday . We enjoy playing board games as a family and really enjoy this brand . My 6 and 3 year old love playing this game . They are worn out by the end of it and by then they are ready for bed . This is a great game that encourages following directions and serving others .	1
When the kids visit they like to play this game . I have not played it myself but in my situation it is fine with me if the guests enjoy it.Happy Shopping !	1
We really like this game ! Our girl scout troop loved this on an evening outing ! I think its just plain fun and the girls really seemed to enjoy themselves and some of the things they were `` caught '' doing . A perfect game for pre-teens and beyond.I do think of it as educational as it forces a childs social skills into play .	1
Party Gras is fun from the start . It does n't take more than a minute to get going . Players ask each other questions and depending on responses take or give up beads . Because you play one category per card , then discard , the options are open . Everyone in our family enjoyed the game , which can go as long or short as you like.It 's more fun to play in the background while you 're doing something else , because some of the prompts fit into life on the go . Otherwise , some of the prompts are engineered for the dare or refusal . It plays well during a party going on , dinner , or video watching . You do n't necessarily learn about other players , except how you enjoy the interaction .	1
If you 're looking for a game to play after a big dinner & drinks , sitting around full & sleepy on the couch , look elsewhere . This game requires standing and walking about . It also requires a crowd willing to try something different and be a little uninhibited.If you 're looking for something fun to do either as an ice-breaker or a family game , this game can be really fun ! We played it twice over Christmas , with a crowd of 10 - 12 , aged 10 - 75 . Everyone enjoyed it.Basically , there are mardi gras beads which are shared out equally . And there are cards with a bunch of challenges on them ( find someone with a nose smaller than yours , make someone look at their shoes , catch someone asking for help , get someone to refuse to massage your shoulders , etc ) . Every person has 2 cards - when you have played one you discard and pick another . Everytime you successfully play a card ( complete one of the 3 tasks on it ) , you take a necklace from the person you 'played ' . ( There are also a few extra cards like Go Crazy - e.g . spin around 10x and take 2 necklaces from the person of your choice . ) At a pre-established time the game ends , and the person with the most necklaces wins . It 's less confusing than it sounds -- it 's difficult to explain.NOTE : Before we tried it I did n't understand how you could ever 'play ' someone -- they know you are trying to get them to do something from your card so as to steal their necklace , so why would they do it ? BUT there is a rule that everyone must answer all questions honestly ( e.g . Do you have a tattoo ? Have you been to Disney World in the past 5 years ? etc ) . Also SOME tasks are to get someone to REFUSE something ( so you do n't know if someone wants you to take out the trash , or if they want you to say no ) , and also some tasks are just about seeing someone laugh , or finding someone shorter than you , etc.NOTE 2 : The game does n't get repetitive quickly , as there are many cards , and each of them has 3 choices of tasks -- so someone could discard a card without anyone in the room ever hearing what 2/3 of the tasks are.NOTE 3 : It says 13 and up but anyone who can read can play ; it 's not like the questions are at all 'adult ' in nature.BOTTOM LINE : Fun for the right time , the right crowd . Needs people with energy and a good sense of silly . I would guess that the ideal amount of players would be between 6 - 10 .	1
This game is great for parties , especially the ones geared more toward family-centric or youth-centric . It 's actually pretty fun and interesting the first time , mostly because of the 'new game factor ' , but after a few times , it does get repetitive . It 's a great idea , but it 's definitely not something that you can pull out time after time like Scrabble or Monopoly . Although these are completely different types of games , it does show that in my opinion that Party Gras is not a game with high replayable value . Attach on this fairly high price ticket and I would n't want to even give this game a try since there are so many other games with smaller price tags with so much more replay value .	1
Party Gras is a good game to play with a bunch of friends . It will keep you entertained for hours , trying to figure out how to win beads . Almost like being down in New Orleans at Marti Gras . The more people you have playing the better this game is .	1
Party Gras is one of those games that had our family talking a lot about it . That is a good thing . The game is supposed to get people in a group talking and interacting especially at parties and other fun oriented gatherings . The game comes with a bunch of beautiful colored beads and cards . The idea is that you have three cards and have to pick one of the things on the cards you are going to use to trap or take beads from others.The interactions for the most part are fun and silly , but once in a while they are downright stupid and on occasion insulting . I mean , in most groups I am in , I would not want to emulate a dog lifting its leg to spray territory . For the most part , however , trying to get someone to stay or do something might be on the cards such as trying to get someone to tell you their favorite something-or-other . They immediately might say no but that could be what is really on your card- it could be to get them to REFUSE to do something . That does cause some laughs and fun.I thought this game was quite a bit of fun , but some of my family members thought it was not as fun as they had hoped it would be , but they did appear to enjoy it anyway.I recommend this game heartily with reservations if you have the time to scan the cards and remove a few of the less tasteful cards before guests arrive in situations where you think it appropriate to do so . The beads are pretty , the game play is fast and we all laughed a lot , however , it is just a fun game with no real competition , more just time for laughing and being silly .	1
We got this in time to bring along with us to a few holiday time gatherings and in every situation , the game seemed to take on a life of its own . A large part of how successful the game will be depends on the people you are playing with . If you have some particularly manipulative players , you 'll end up having a few paranoid guests who are convinced that EVERYTHING that ANYONE is doing is a ploy to get their beads ... and they are probably right.The first time we played , I brought the game along to a game night where there were a total of 5 guests . Although the rules say that the dealer can set the time , we ended up playing for much longer than the original set time and keeping the game running in the background as we played a couple other games.We took it to a few places after that and in small groups we followed the rules pretty well , but in larger groups , we just used the cards and the beads and let the game run its course . The largest group we played with was about 25 people at a Christmas party - we did n't even explain the rules , just handed people beads and a card and in minutes people had figured things out and were running around trying to collect more beads and get more cards . It was a ton of fun.The only downside I saw in this game was the packaging . Although I like the handy handle and do n't mind the plastic exterior , the boxing inside is flimsy and fell apart after trying to pull the contents out and in a number of times . It would work better if the entire top of the game case would come almost entirely unzipped so you would n't have to pull the materials out and shove them back in when the game is done.This game proved to be so simple and so fun that I will continue to bring this game to parties and game nights from here on out .	1
I really get a kick out of Mardi Gras and while this game does not come close to the experience of New Orleans , it was fun to mix it up playing this game while making some tried and true Mardi Gras drinks with friends at a party . Hurricanes and Mud Slides were tied in with this game and fun was had by all couples in attendance . This is an inexpensive way to give a jolt to your Mardi Gras celebration ! Fun !	1
Okay , my title might be a bit confusing . I will get back to that . My neice and nephews came over on New Year 's Day and I brought this out after everyone finished eating and carrying on . They all loved it , but it would probably be better to bring out in the beginning of a party or get-together so you do n't necessarily think it 's someone trying to get you to do something solely for the game . For instance , if you are trying to get a person to say `` no '' to getting you a drink . You ask them without having them realize that it is the game that you are playing . Thus , if you are carrying on and talking , one might think you really do want them to get it for you . I hope I made that clear enough . So just `` play '' it while you are chatting and not an intense `` game '' . They all loved it though .	1
Me , my friends and my family have really enjoyed the parties where this game was brought out . It turns laughs into belly laughs . My 20 something children have both taken it to parties they 've hosted . Easy to learn , fun from the start . What a great game !	1
We have large family gatherings at Thanksgiving and Christmas and I thought Party Gras would be a fun sitting around the living room kind of game , and it is.The game includes 36 strings of beads , 300 Party Gras Cards and directions , and the zippered bag it comes in is perfect for storage . The cards to the game include things such as Mind Control ... .get someone to go to the kitchen , Caught in the Act ... ..catch someone talking about the weather , Fashion Police ... ..find someone without jewelry or a watch , Challenge Cards , Go Crazy Cards , each different task tells you how many beads you can 'steal'.What 's fun about this game is that it can go for any amount of time , 5 min , an hour , however long you decide . At the end of the time limit the person with the most beads wins.Imagine a serious relative drawing a card where they have to Jump up and down and scream `` I want to win this game '' 3 times , this game is sure to loosen up even the most tightly wound people ! As far as durability , these are the mardi gras beads you can buy at dollar stores , etc . and the cards are your typical game cards , the bag is plastic with a zipper and handle , so as long as you use common sense I do n't see any problems with durability.Our family had quite a bit of fun with this game , and I think it 's a game that will be used frequently.I received this game in exchange for review from the Amazon Vine program .	1
Party Gras is an excellent ice breaker for medium size groups looking to network . I see this game more for for Work or Corporate gatherings than for casual family game nights . I found some of the interactions anti-climactic for groups of people who know each other already although there are enough choices that the overall game is fun.The theme of Mardi Gras ( thus the name Party Gras ) comes solely from the glitzy beads that are the tokens in this game . A player draws a card with tasks and wins colorful beads which are the currency . The players wander around the room and make contact with others attempting to get missions accomplished and win additional beads for the challenged target person . Samples of some of these theme assignments are : Mind Control - Make someone say the color of a strand of beads you 're wearingMake someone turn up the volume of the music or TVTalk it Out - Find someone who ate candy todayFind someone who does n't have GPS in their carCaught in Act - Catch someone thanking someone elseCatch someone making plans for laterThere are a few Challenge cards - Challenge another player to a staring contest.Have another player guess how many fingers you 're holding up behind your back.My problem was with the Go Crazy Cards - I found them a bit distasteful for many groups ( with the exception of boy scout troops or frat parties ) For instance you are challenged to stand in the middle of the room and do the `` Hokey Pokey '' by yourself or pretend you 're a dog , get on all fours and raise your leg on at least three other players . There are just too many groups that this is downright inappropriate for . Of course you can always remove the offending cards before the event ( and hopefully get all of them removed ) .All in all , I think it 's a pretty good game although for what you get it seems a bit overpriced . If you need more beads you can always dash off to your local party supply store & get fist fulls for a few bucks . The people I played with all said they had fun and would certainly look forward to playing again .	1
This is a fun game to have . And more the merrier . I had it at my sons birthday party . Though its really not for younger kids its fun for adults and I would say teenagers . Even the 7-8 yr olds had some fun . But for most part its fun for older kids and adults . Definitely brings out the college days ... Fun themed . If u have very small kids they are going to be all over the beads..They are really cute and hard to keep ur hands off . The one that accomplishes the most tasks successfully wins the most beads . I think we can also use the ideas to customize and have our own fun themed parties and make more such cards . This is quite complete as it is with 36 string beads and 300 party cards . 4 to 12 players it says ... but I did have more and it really was not a problem.Definite party game . I love Pictionary and this would be a more fun concept imo .	1
Party Gras is an interesting game and I certainly do n't own any games like it . Unlike most games that require a minimum of 2-3 players for optimal play with Party Gras the opposite is true . The more people you have playing the more fun it is , and because it can accommodate such a large number of players nobody ever has to feel left out or like they have to team up with another player just to make sure everybody can play . ( Which is one of my biggest complaints at game night is having to play something like Settlers of Catan on a team . ) Party Gras has a simple enough premise : Get all the beads you can ( just like Mardi Gras ) ! But how you get those beads is what makes this game such a riot . Along with the strands of beads that every player starts out with each player is given a card with a task that they either must do or convince another player to do . Once their card has been completed they show it to another player and receive a strand of their beads in exchange.This game is great for large family gatherings if you 're a loud , boisterous , outgoing family ; ice breakers for small conferences and group settings ; and at any type of party . Also , the game is super flexible because you can play until somebody has ALL the beads ( which I honestly think might be impossible if your friends and family are as competitive as mine are ) or you can have a predetermined time limit for the game and whoever has the most beads at the end of that time period is the winner.Overall it 's a fun game and great if you 've got a large group to play with .	1
This is a fun icebreaker party game.We brought it out at a Spring BBQ where most of the guests did not know each other . Party Gras really helped everyone get laughing and talking with other people . It was great to see so much smiling and laughing between the guests.Would recommend !	1
Say Anything : 3-8 Players , Ages 10+ , Average Play Time = 30 MinutesSay Anything Family : 3-6 Players , Ages 8+ , Average Play Time = 30 MinutesI & # 8217 ; ll keep this short and sweet & # 8230 ; out of all of the games in my household , this one is the game most requested . The kids really enjoy coming up with silly answers , especially when it comes time to point out my opinion in various situations . Every answer I received on my turn revolved around & # 8220 ; Star Trek & # 8221 ; in some way & # 8230 ; perhaps they are trying to tell me something ? We even brought this game out during a family & friend get-together , where most of them are not gamers by any sense of the definition . Rather than score points , we just passed around the trivia deck and answered questions in humorous and inappropriate ways & # 8230 ; this was , of course , after we sent the kids upstairs . Pictures were drawn and secrets were revealed , though it was all in good fun.There isn & # 8217 ; t that much difference between the two games , in all honesty . The cards in & # 8220 ; Say Anything & # 8221 ; are a bit more open-ended to where adults can take advantage of & # 8220 ; dirty-minded & # 8221 ; answers , though playing it with family and keeping things PG is easily doable . Likewise , the cards in & # 8220 ; Say Anything Family & # 8221 ; are bit more cutesy in nature , but can be used in an adult setting . Both games are flexible that way , which I appreciate . The regular edition is designed to accommodate eight players , making it a tad more appealing than the family edition , which only accommodates six.Is either game right for you ? Well , that depends . & # 8220 ; Say Anything & # 8221 ; and & # 8220 ; Say Anything Family & # 8221 ; is a very social experience , one that gets better the more people you have playing . If it & # 8217 ; s just you and a spouse , it may not be all that rewarding unless imaginary friends are involved somehow ( hey , I & # 8217 ; m not judging ) . If you host or attend parties on a regular basis or have regular family game nights that involve more than three people , then either game will fit the bill nicely . It & # 8217 ; s a great way for people to learn about each other and well worth the investment .	1
The most recent title from game publisher North Star Games is Say Anything Family Edition ( 2011 ) , which brings their popular Say Anything game to the family crowd . Say Anything Family has more kid-centric questions ( which work fine for adults in a group too ) than the original game . And just like Wits & Wagers Family , it features family-friendly meeples on the reverse of the answer boards . One down side is that it caters up to 6 players instead of 8 , but a noteworthy positive is that this game makes a massive technological leap from Say Anything 's Select-o-matic 5000 by upgrading to the Select-o-matic 6000 ! The differences from the original are not huge , which is a good thing , because the successful formula that made Say Anything fun is retained . But overall this is an ideal choice for families and groups with children.All the North Star games are excellent , and I recommend them highly . They all come with dry erase markers and answer boards , and the company is most generous in sending replacement markers . One highlight of the answer boards that come with the family editions of both games is that the reverse sides feature meeples , and since they 're designed to be used with dry erase markers , kids will have great fun decorating and customizing these meeples ! If you 've never played any of North Star 's party games , then do yourself a favour - now is the time to get into this exciting new world ! And Say Anything Family is a great choice for doing this with ! - EndersGame @ BGG	1
`` Say Anything '' is a wonderful game for kids and family members to learn a few more funny and surprising things [ or even stupid things : ) ] about their friends and family.Its rules are pretty simple . You need at least three people to play and six at the max . Each player takes a dry erase board and one person becomes judge every round . The judge asks a question from a card and then each player gives their best guess about the answer in the JUDGES OPINION . The judge chooses the best answer using the Selectomatic 5000 , which is a gadget the judge puts the answer by turning the arrow to the correct color . Once that is done each player puts their chips on the card that they think will be the right one . The judge can get points by the amount of chips that are in each card and the players can get points if the judge chooses the board that has their chips in it . A player can also get an extra point if the judge chooses his answer.This is very similar to Apples to Apples except that there are many questions on one card and you can have endless answers . This is a great game for the family !	1
Talk , talk , talk ... that 's what you 'll be doing while playing this fun and revealing family game . Revealing the inner most thoughts of your guests will be very interesting and enlightening when they answer your question of the round . Great for ages 8 and up , but really fun for a group of adults as well.Simply draw one of the question cards . Each player writes down their answer and the player with the highly prized Select-o-Matic 6000 becomes the judge . The judge rules on who 's answer is correct ( well , maybe correct is n't the exact answer here - let 's say that it 's the answer that the judge loves the most ) . Each correct winning answer earns points and the most points wins . This is definitely a great party game adults would really love getting into with their wacky answers as well as younger children with their version of the answers to questions .	1
Proving once again that my superpower is Getting Random Strangers To Give Me Things ( though , frankly , there are not enough Random Strangers and not enough Things Given ) , I just received a review copy of Northstar Games Say Anything Family . This is actually my second free game from Northstar - the first was , oddly enough , Say Anything.In fact , let 's just cut to the chase - if you 've played the original game , there are no surprises here . The game is essentially the same wonderful Box O'Fun with the following differences : - The family version of the game only supports 3-6 players ... which is probably my only quibble with the new release . I do n't think it works particularly well with 3 players ( though 4 - two kids & two adults - worked like a charm ) . I do understand that limiting the upper number of players makes picking easier for young players and answer duplication less likely.- The cards have only three questions on them - and while some cards lend themselves to gross answers ( we had a question which managed to invoke both booger-eating & posterior-picking during one of our games ) , the tendency toward R-rated answers seems to be mitigated . While some might be tempted to complain about the smaller number of questions , it 's quickly obvious when playing with kids ( and some adults ) that this keeps the game from bogging down while the Judge chooses their question.- The artwork has been meeple-ized for your gaming protection - it 's very cute & the members of our family immediately had their favorites . ( Due to the utter coolness of the yellow Super-Meeple , my boys end up with him & I 'm left with orange Balloon-Meeple . ) The formula that makes Say Anything games work so well is extremely simple - take the rotating Judge concept from Apples to Apples , add in the answer submission system ( tiny dry-erase boards & pens ) from Wits & Wagers , and top it off with a kinder version of the Wits & Wagers betting system.Players take turns being the Judge , who draws a question card & picks one of the questions to read . The rest of the players then race to scribble out answers that they think will entice/entertain or otherwise engage the Judge.After all the answers are in ( the Judge gets to decide if answers are duplicates - you ca n't have those - and who got their answer down first ) , the Judge secretly picks the answer they like using the Select-o-Matic 5000 , which sounds a lot more sophisticated than it is . ( It 's a spinner that does n't spin very well - which is how it 's supposed to work . ) Then the rest of the players quickly lay their bets ( each has two betting chips ) on the answer or answers they think the Judge will pick.With the chips played , the Judge reveals their answer & points are scored - the system is designed to reward players who guess correctly without creating chances for runaway victories ... in fact , the entire game is designed for maximum party enjoyment rather than maximum gamerness . ( Yes , I know `` gamerness '' is not a word - but most of you get what I 'm talking about . ) Here 's what I like about the games : - plays quickly - a huge plus for party games- nobody feels dumb - you can approach how to answer the questions in whatever form you wish : you can try to please the Judge , you can try to be the class clown & make with the silliness , you can simply try & entertain yourself ... - the score does n't matter much - sure , if you 're playing a 2 hour game of El Grande , you want to know the exact score at the end , but the draw here is not the winner ( s ) celebrating , it 's the journey getting there- the rules - they are incredibly easy to explain- it 's got the good parts of Apples to Apples with added creativity - the free-form questions means the game does n't devolve into the same kinds of jokes & picks ( as A2A has a tendency to do ) - it simplifies the Wits & Wagers scoring - I love Wits & Wagers ... but the betting system is tough for non-gamers to wrap their heads around . Say Anything uses the same kind of system in a way that 's friendlier to non-gamers . ( Note : I have not played Wits & Wagers : Family , which evidently has much more non-gamer friendly scoring . ) NOTE : this review originally appeared on my blog ( [ ... ] ) and on the Opinionated Gamers website .

It is a thought provoking game that encourages family talk and imagination . Its also a great way to learn some new thing about your family ! My husband and I enjoyed it just as much as the kids	1
We are a board game family and this game by North Star Games proves to be another fun game . There is a judge who has the SLICE-O-MATIC 6000 which is the voting mechanism . The judge will choose a card from the pile and pick a question to read . ( There are 3 questions on one side of the card and 3 on the back , however play with the yellow cards first . ) Player will write down what they think is the best answer and lay the answer card which they wrote on with the provided markers in the center of the game table . Do this fast though ! Once all players have wrote down an answer , the judge will choose a player using the slice-o-matic with the answer they like best , but they do not show it to the players , they lay if face down . Now scoring begins . With the tokens players will place them next to the answer board they think the judge liked best . That is really the gist of it.There are many question cards with family and kid-friendly questions , however if playing with adults only , use your imagination . All pieces to the game are high quality and should hold up for a while . This is very entertaining and highly recommended . It is for ages 8+ and 3-6 players . We found that playing in groups was also a lot of fun ! I never played Say Anything which also used the tokens but I would love to see the Meeples like inWits & Wagers Family . But the game is a must , easy to understand and everyone has a blast !	1
The game is easy to learn and explain . One person draws a card and selects a question from it to read out loud . Everyone else writes down an answer that they think the reader will think is the best answer . All of the answers are played face up , and the reader secretly selects the one they like best . The other players now try to guess which one the reader picked . Players score points for writing the winning answer , voting on the winning answer , and the reader gets points for people guessing right . It kind of reminds me of a cross between Apples to Apples ( the playing and picking answers ) , Wits and Wagers Family ( the betting aspect ) , and any one of a number of party games that rewards you for knowing the other players well or provides an opportunity to get to know each other better . While that may sound like a bit of a mash-up , it plays very smooth and really hit the sweet spot for us.This game is about the experience , but here 's a few quick thoughts about the rules/components/etc . I appreciate that this game is easy to teach , and that you really can just jump right in and play . No one seems to have any questions , it 's nice when the rules just blend into the background and the focus is on fun . I really like that each card has three possible questions and the reader gets to choose which one to pick . Aside from increasing replayability , this is an opportunity to direct the game a bit , avoid something you do n't want to talk about , or explore what the other players might think you think on a fun topic . This is the type of game you could really play for any length of time , but the scoring system seems to have the game play out for just the right amount of time . I did miss the meeples though ! We love betting with the meeples in Wits & Wagers Family , and with the art of the game showing meeple images I found myself looking through the box a couple times to try to find them . There are tokens that are used instead , but I like the meeples better and wish they had been included in this game as well.Wits and Wagers Family was a big hit with my extended family over the holidays , so I was really excited to give Say Anything Family a try at a recent family get together . I was able to easily convince my mom and grandma , my aunt Judy , and my uncle Rob to give it a try . This game had us laughing , groaning , telling stories , and having fun together right from the get go . We were grossed out by the idea of kissing a urinal , imagining what the best part of being a dog is , pondering how lottery winnings would be spent , discussing who would be the most fun to have dinner with ( Gene Simmons in full costume ? ! ! ? ) , and laughing about what the weirdest family secret might be . We kept a causal pace throughout the game , with lots of conversation and smiles . It really was an amazing experience , and I 'm looking forward to many more plays . It was a big hit , and we ended up with a phenomenal 12 thumbs up , everyone loved it ! RandyGrowing Up Gamers	1
This game is wonderful ! Yet another amazing game from this company ! Although it was a little hard for my three year old , he came up with his own way to play and loved it ! I know that he is going to be able to grow into this game . My friends ' children also love this game . I would highly recommend this game !	1
This is like twister in a way -- the mat has the letters ( in alphabetical order ) around the outside , and the object is for the child to put different body parts on the right letters ( selected from the & # 34 ; tornado & # 34 ; spinner ) . There are 5 letters or free spaces each time -- feet , hands , and ear . It does n't specify which hand , which is good . The kids will be twisted up trying to get their ear on the & # 34 ; m & # 34 ; and hands on the & # 34 ; a & # 34 ; and & # 34 ; b & # 34 ; ! Mat is a thick , sturdy plastic , adults and children have played on it with no issues .	1
Bought this for my 3-year-old son who is learning his letters . Thought it would compliment what he is learning in school . It is simple enough , that he can follow the directions . He 's a little short to be able to reach everything , but the instructions state that you get points for what you can do ( you do n't have to do everything to score points ) . I even had fun playing , so I wo n't complain when he asks to play . He 's just the right age to start playing this .	1
My ESL kids like this game . However , we can hardly ever win all the cards when you have to put your ear to one item . Maybe they should change that to a different body part . It is a good twist on Twister and the kids can practice their alphabet and vocabulary .	1
Purchases this as a gift for my niece because my kids have one and really enjoy it . It gets them moving and it is a fun way to find their letters . My 3 year old is uses the letter disks while we play . We use the pictures for my 6 year old to help him learn the sounds of the letters .	1
My daughter , 5 years old , received this game as a Christmas gift . I also have a 2.5 year old . The girls love to play this game ! My 5 year old loves to help her little sister find the letters and figure out how to sstttrrreeetttccchhh to reach all the spots.At the end of the game , the `` winner '' is who ever had the letter found on the super secret letter card . We have quite competitive children so we have made this game one that does not have a winner , but the person with the `` lucky letter . '' Who ever had the `` lucky letter '' gets to choose if they are the caller or the stretcher on the next round.If my 5yo has a friend over , they often ask to play this game . After a round of instruction , they can play this game with parent support but not necessarily parent involvement . Sometimes it takes a little parent support to figure out how to reach all the letters but they are able to spin the `` tornado , '' call out the letters and help each other stretch to reach . It 's fun to watch them play !	1
We had tons of fun with this game ! I 'm excited it helps my 3-year-old learn letters . My 7-year-old loves it too . The box is quite big , make sure you have lots of room for storing it . Not a take along type of game . It 's really a lot like Twister , with some added learning thrown in . Trying to touch your ears to the letters is fun , and hilarious . The only thing I do n't like , is that if we get too many feet cards right away and not a lot of letters , the game is over too soon , and no one has the winning secret card yet . Just shuffle the cards well so you do n't have too many feet card . The mat is very sturdy and colorful , and the cards and peices are well made too . We love Dr. Seuss and ordered this for his birthday celebration week . I would recommend this game .	1
This Dr Suess game is an excellent play on the beloved classic - Twister . The mat is small enough for little bodies , and the option to use pictures or letters is great . Currently , we are on pictures , but we do try some letters each time . My daughter is four and really enjoys this game - she likes watching me try to contort on the little mat as well .	1
We love this game . They love stretching to reach all the letters . They 'll play the game at least a couple of time each time we pull it out .	1
We bought this last year , and it 's still in one piece ! Not to mention the fun ! We do n't follow the rules exactly but make it more of a & # 34 ; twister & # 34 ; alphabet game we play with our 4 year old son , he LOVES it ! Great educational tool !	1
We 've had this game for a year , and my kids still love it . My 3 year old quickly learned all of the letters and their sounds by playing this game . They laugh their little heads off every time they play ( especially when they can talk their dad into playing with them ) . It 's like twister , only better and with the added bonus that they learn something .	1
I have more plays of this game than any other in my collection . I love the theme and artwork and the mechanics and how they all blend together to allow you to really get immersed in the game . Amazing !	1
I have been looking at this game for a long time and at some point my wife said it looked like one she would enjoy playing so I ordered it . After two plays , she decided that , nope , it was not her thing ; she did n't want to play any more.I have come to really like the game a lot -- I 'm not sure why -- buying & selling , etc . do not usually interest me but this game is great fun . Elves , dwarves , gnomes , a really beautiful map and quality components all make it a fine game . It has one of the best rule books I 've ever seen.Now all I have to do is find someone to play it with.Highly recommended .	1
Belfort is a 2011 release from Tasty Minstrel Games , and could well prove to be their most successful strategy game yet . It 's a worker-placement driven euro with resource management that is primarily about area control . It 's strength is that it takes familiar euro mechanics but integrates them in a new way . What 's more , it adds a somewhat unusual ( for a euro ) fantasy theme.The basic concept of this game for 2-5 players is that you 're competing against other players in an effort to use a workforce of elves , dwarves and gnomes to build the city of Belfort . You 'll need to organize your work force , gather resources , stake out building sites within the city confines - all while your competitors are doing everything they can to ensure that they succeed and you fail in your efforts to build this new and beautiful city . But the buildings you create will give you small bonuses , and can you use these to your advantage ? Belfort is a highly polished product in every respect : artwork , components , theme , mechanics , humour , rules . Everything shows evidence of careful play-testing and balance , and it 's clear that this game has been a labour of love that has benefited from the hard work of designers , developers , play-testers , publisher , and artist . It sure is no ordinary worker placement game , and is set to make quite a splash over the next year . There is the potential for some downtime and a longer game with the full complement of five players ( especially AP types ) , but aside from that this game gets pretty much everything right . Very impressive game ! - EndersGame @ BGG	1
Since it was high on the list of popular games at the major gaming convention in Germany , and it was a worker placement game ( my favorite mechanic ) , I was very excited to finally get this new game . Not disappointed at all ! ! The theme is so fun ( elves , dwarves and gnomes ) , it is easy to learn , and the depth is very good . You can make it easy to play or more difficult , depending on a few simple modifications on the board . I would say it 's medium to light-heavy for strategy . I got this game about two weeks ago and have already played it six times . So happy I got it . If you like games like Le Havre , Agricola , or Calyus , you will probably like this game as well . Enjoy !	1
This is my favorite worker placement game of the past several years , partially from the excellent mechanics and partially from the lighthearted fantasy theme . Players use Elves and Dwarves to gather resources which are then used to build buildings in the five quadrants of the city . Every few rounds , points are awarded for majority of buildings in each city section . What makes the game even more interesting are the use of a player 's buildings to provide new and different options for a player 's workers . A solid game that last just long enough to be fun but not too long to drag on , I highly recommend it . ( From [ ... ] 's Unplugged Holiday Game Guide ) [ ... ]	1
As an avid boardgamer , this game has a special place in my heart and a very functional place in my collection . It utilizes several classic boardgame mechanics simultaneously , while at the same time remaining very accessible and easy to understand.The concept is simple , you are helping to build Belfort , as is every other player . There are many different building that can be built , and each building that is built by anyone opens up additional opportunities for every player in the game.This is , at its heart , a worker placement game that also utilizes a kind of auction system for resources . Each player gets two types of workers ( and eventually a specialized third type ) and choose between those workers harvesting resources , building , or several specialized actions . These actions vary based on the way you chose to set up the game , as there is a `` basic '' set of actions , an `` advanced '' , and `` interactive '' which involves being able to steal resources from other buildings , and swap building ownership , etc.The ultimate goal is to win the kings approval as the best builder and win the game . HOWEVER , one of the great mechanics is there are three scoring phases , and if someone pulls out to a big lead early , they will be requires to pay higher `` taxes '' , which is an excellent system for keeping the field tight up until the end . There are rarely blow-out victories here , but good strategy will often win the day.Great family game , great game to introduce non-boardgamers to a more robust boardgaming experience , and plenty of good times to be had for experienced players . This is a solid addition to any collection .	1
Belfort takes elements of resources management , worker placement and area control and combines them into a fairly unique , fun experience.There are a lot of pieces in Belfort and it seems extremely complex at first , but the core gameplay is actually pretty straightforward once you get into the game . It 's depth and strategy arise from a series of choices players make in each round . The components are of very high quality ( as has been the case with all TMG games I 've played so far ) , including wooden worker , resource and building tokens and heavy cardboard tokens and gameboards.Here are a few key points gameplay:1 ) There are seven rounds , with scoring occurring after rounds 3 , 5 and 7 based on who controls the majority of buildings in each of the board 's five districts and who has the most of each type of worker ( elves , dwarves and gnomes ) .2 ) Each round essentially has three phases ( the rules say five for clarity , but & # 34 ; Phase 1 & # 34 ; is just moving the marker that tracks which round you 're on and & # 34 ; Phase 5 & # 34 ; is scoring in rounds that have it ) .- During & # 34 ; Placement & # 34 ; players assign workers to tasks including gathering resources or money , earning special privileges for the round , training new workers or changing turn order.- During & # 34 ; Collection & # 34 ; players gain resources , income and pay taxes.- During & # 34 ; Actions & # 34 ; players build buildings , hire specialized workers ( the gnomes ) , draw new building cards and/or use special powers.3 ) Each district on the board has 14 building spaces corresponding to specific types of building cards . When a player builds a building they place a marker on an open space of that type on the board , and then can use the related card 's special powers during the game . The number of each player 's buildings in a district determines scoring.I glossed over subtleties but that 's the gist . It sounds more complicated than it is , although it 's by no means an entry level game . I found it well balanced and of reasonable length for a game of this type.While the game does support 2-5 players , be aware that the two player game is actually a variant of the & # 34 ; full & # 34 ; 3-5 player game . With 2 players there will be extra & # 34 ; phantom players & # 34 ; that have buildings on the board for blocking and scoring purposes . The rules suggest being familiar with the game before trying the 2 player version , but veteran gamers wo n't have too much trouble ( I started with the two player ) . This type of modification does n't always work well , but I actually liked it here and thought it nicely adapted the game without really changing the feel.Overall Belfort is a great addition to my game library and something I can see myself playing fairly regularly.Highly recommended .	1

Hiring Gnomes as staff for the building thereby , activating many of the special abilities and helping the player achieve success . Likewise , players can hire guilds to help along the way.As each player is building in the five districts , their influence grows and knowing what and when to build can be critical to their success . According to the calendar , the scoring will be done three times throughout the building season . This will based on each players influence in each of the five districts as well as the size of their workforce of Elves , Dwarves and Gnomes . By the end of the seven rounds , the player who has earned the most points wins the Key to the City ! First let me state that Belfort is an amazing worker placement game . It is very well thought out and offers plenty of strategy while it is still simple to learn and understand . With all the worker placement games out there ( and there are tons of them , ) this one to me stands hands above most of them . With the popularity of gateway games of the genre like Lords of Waterdeep , Belfort brings much more to the table . The theme stands out to me immensely . I am not sure why exactly but it probably is a combination of many things such as the artwork , story and feel of the game . Many games of this style have themes that are just pasted on such as Lords of Waterdeep and have really no effect on the game . The mechanics of cube pushing are really all that matter in providing the character of the game at this point.Belfort somehow manages to incorporate their theme into the overall experience and make it absolutely critical to the experience . The strategy of the game is quite deep and yet only feels like a medium weight game . If the players are familiar with euro style games , they will pick this up very easily and a great game will be born every time you play it . Yet as stated before , it is a good game for new gamers to learn and pick up quickly . This also serves very well as a family game as there is nothing for adults to have to worry about theme wise.The artwork of Belfort is top notch and really , really adds a lot of flavor to the gaming experience . The components are some of the best yet for a euro game . The boards , guilds and other pieces are thick and colorful . There was no warping whatsoever in my copy . Everything is easy to read and understand . The cards are of good stock , weight and good artwork . A little assembly is required as you need to put stickers on the different colored playing pieces when breaking open the game.My only complaint may be that player boards might have been a bit better as you need a lot of room to play this game . The building costs are on the player board and on the cards again . I have yet to see anyone use the board to determine the cost of building . Some space may have been saved here and there , with the calendar board , resource board and player boards and a little better planning , but this is a very minor complaint . As over all this game is awesome.Belfort has become my go to game in worker placement genre . I have to play anything of this weight that is this fun , deep and easy to learn . While there are many great games out there , Belfort should be a table favorite for a long time to come . You don & # 8217 ; t shelve great games and Belfort is a GREAT game.I am giving Belfort 8.5 out 10 stars.This game is Club Fantasci Certified !

I like this game much more than Dominion . It has theme for one thing , not just a general pasted-on theme . The game has more meat to it than Dominion also .	1
& # 34 ; Eminent Domain & # 34 ; manages to be something really unique- a deck-building game that focuses how cards are used to play in a very interesting way . Players start out with a base deck , made up of five different kinds of cards and a wild card . Decks of those same five base cards lay on a special tile . Throughout the game , players may play one of their cards in hand for an action , but they must select another one of the five base cards for its & # 34 ; role , & # 34 ; essentially another action specific to each card , different from playing it as an action . The player then takes the card from the tile and adds it to his discard . Each player then may follow the role by also taking that action ( though with penalties ) , or passing and drawing another card from their deck.In some respects , the game feels very similar to & # 34 ; Race for the Galaxy , & # 34 ; but & # 34 ; Eminent Domain & # 34 ; is much simpler to learn and perhaps more fun to play . Player 's attempt to colonize words , or take them over via military conquest ( small plastic spaceships act as military currency in the game ) , research technology ( which gives players access to more kinds of cards ) , search for new worlds to bring into their empire , and produce or trade goods for victory points . There is a lot going on here but not so much that you feel overwhelmed . Also , with its 45 minute- 1 hour playing time the game will end before it starts feeling repetitive . Like & # 34 ; Race for the Galaxy , & # 34 ; it does very much feel like each player is engaged in a solitaire game of building up their own unique star empire and trying to get the most points before anyone else . With the & # 34 ; roles , & # 34 ; however , there is more player interaction . What you choose to do on your turn will effect other players most of the time . This helps to keep players engaged throughout.Generally , I am very pleased with & # 34 ; Eminent Domain & # 34 ; and believe that fans of great deck-builders should definitively check it out .	1
It 's a little complicated to learn , but a good once through and a trial game later , you 're going to want to come back to it and explore new strategies .	1
I am basically a wargamer who enjoys other games that are civ building , economic competition or space exploration related.I played the game with a gaming group I belong to , and found it interesting . I need to devle into the rules a little deeper , but I did enjoy the session . However , it was much more of a learning experience than a great gaming experience . If you wish to delve into deck building games , there are others I would recommend before this.The components and artwork are OUTSTANDING . The rules are easy to follow.I will not play this game a lot , as their are other games I wish to pursue , and I do intend to check out Race for the Galaxy . As for calling the game a `` toy '' , it is not . I would not buy the game for a child under the age of 15 . The rules say it is a game for 2-4 players . I think 3 is the minimum I would recommend . The information provided here gives some thoughtful insights to the game [ ... ] It is a game that requires a dedicated gaming group to get full enjoyment . I will continue to seek the 5-star space game . The closest I have come is Cosmic Encounters . I am considering Space 4X4 as the next foray into space .	1
Originally posted at [ ... ] , a new idea everyday ! Game-Eminent DomainPrice- $ 40Producer-Tasty Minstrel GamesSet-Up/Play/Clean-Up-1 HourTL ; DR-Only a few faults make this game great instead of excellent . 87.5 % Basics- Compete for the Galaxy ! In Eminent Domain , players take the roles of different groups trying to conquer the most locations across the galaxy . This is a deck building game with a twist . Each turn players do three things in order . First , they can play a card from their hand as an action . These actions either build fighters , settle planets , produce resources , removes cards from your deck , or other things . Then , players draw one card from the central board as their role . This new card goes into the players deck , hence the deck building aspect . These roles produce/sell resources for points , settle attack or settle planets for points , research advanced cards with new actions , or search for new planets . Here is where things become interesting . When the first player selects a role , all other players may follow that role doing the exact same thing as the lead player . For an example , if the lead player searches for more planets , they draw a card from the center and play as many cards with the search for planets symbol as they can from their hand to draw planets to settle/conquer . All other plays may play as many cards with search for planets symbols from their hands to draw planets off turn . After role selection , then the lead player discards as many cards as they want and draws up to five cards . Play continues until one or two of the role card stacks is empty . Player with the most points wins the galaxy.Mechanics-As I mentioned above , this is a deck building game . I like those games , but this one has the novel twist of letting all players do the same action as the lead player . Now , if you 're lucky/smart , you can take an action each turn instead of just waiting for your turn like in Dominion . Also , the mechanics are very simple . Play a card , draw a card and play cards that match symbols for more results , and discard/draw . Easy as pie ! But , do n't let the simplicity of this game make you think that the game does n't have some depth to it . 5/5Theme-This game has a decent theme , but I do n't think it oozes out of every pore . The different ways to capture planets have diverse enough mechanics that you do feel you 're doing something different when you do them . The art brings you into the game universe as you play cards . However , the game does n't really hammer you over the head with space conquest . It 's very subtle . 3.5/5Instructions-The games instructions are fairly well done , but an extra page or two would really help . You can start playing this game in less than 10 minutes after opening the box for the first time without having played it before . However , even I , an experienced player , still have to check board game geek if some things are allowed or intended . The major issue has to do with symbols . Advanced cards and planets have symbols on them . Lots of people have questions if the advanced cards count as symbols for play . Adding a discussion on that would have really knocked these instructions out of the park . 4.5/5Execution- This is well put together game . The game has nice plastic ships ! In fact they are exactly the same ships as Eclipse . They are as awesome here as they were there . The box is nice , and the main play board is well done . I like the art and card quality . What I would like would be a bit larger play board with spaces for the advanced cards , the points , and the ships . A little bit more would have really made this game excellent . 4.5/5Summary-This is an awesome game . It 's a quick deck building game that is easy to learn and play . This game gives me a 4X feel without the 4X time or rules depth . This game wo n't replace Twilight Imperium , but I promise you will play Eminent Domain far more often than that game ! This is another well done game from Tasty Minstrel Games .	1
Eminent Domain made a big splash when it appeared on the gaming scene in 2011 , after a successful Kickstarter campaign run by publisher Tasty Minstrel Games . This space-themed civilization building and exploration game builds upon the deck-building and role-selection mechanics of several successful card games that have preceded it . Suitable for 2 , 3 or 4 players , this card game from Seth Jaffee plays in about 45 minutes , and proved to be a big hit . Are you ready for the challenge of venturing into space with the cards that Fortuna deals you ? Yes , it 's a deck-building game ! No wait , it 's a role-selection game ! So which is it then ? The correct answer is : both . Like Dominion , it 's a deck-building game - but with other elements . And like Race for the Galaxy , it 's a space-themed role-selection game - but is simpler to play . The role-selection elements also evoke comparisons with Glory to Rome . This does mean that the main mechanics are derivative , and feature a mixture of elements from other games , notably Dominion , Race for the Galaxy , and Glory to Rome . This is n't necessarily a criticism , because the blend works well and makes it sufficiently different to stand on its own.Game-play is smooth and flows quickly , with very little down-time , and the varied actions , roles , and cards enable players to pursue multiple strategies on the road to success . The exploration of these different strategies rewards repeated play and enhances replayability , although a small minority of critics would beg to disagree . Interaction is primarily through the subtlety of the role-selection mechanic , and while some consider this somewhat multi-player solitaire , it is present . The space theme is welcome and much appreciated by many gamers , and the matching art is also generally received very positively , and enhances the theme . While Eminent Domain has been the subject of lukewarm reactions from some , overall it 's a game that has received rave praise.The bottom line : Eminent Domain is certainly indebted to its respected ancestors , such as Dominion , Race for the Galaxy , and Glory to Rome , and unmistakably bears their influence in its design , in terms of the deck-building and role-selection mechanics , and also the space theme that it shares with Race for the Galaxy . But this blend of mechanics and influences does result in a product that is quite different from anything we 've seen before , and allows it to stand on its own despite being constructed on a foundation that is largely derivative . If you enjoy these other titles , there 's a very good chance you 'll love the card-play and dynamics of Eminent Domain enough for it to earn a place in your collection on the basis of its own merits . - EndersGame @ BGG	1
Hours of fun playing this game . If rules confuse you check out video of how . To play by Watchitplayed on YouTube .	1
So I went camping as kind of a chaperone with a youth group and learned to play this game at a picnic table . The occasional breeze made so many stacks of card perilous , but it would have been too warm in the tent . I was enthralled : surveying planets that would be subdued either by force of amassed fleets of fighters or more subtle attrition with one colony at a time . I was producing and trading resources for points , and researching new technologies that- as I think of it- seldom improved the quality of life for my empire- some of the most expensive ones are game changes though & # 8230 ; all this from the comfort of a picnic bench.Game PlayThis is a role-based game similar to Puerto Rico . Where one player chooses a role and does the action then others get to do it too , though not with the same bonus as the person who chose the role . It & # 8217 ; s also a deck building game like Dominion only the number of cards to choose from is always the same and is much smaller . This leads to how the role portion is different . The more often you choose a role , the stronger you will likely be when you choose that role again in the future.My Canadian friends might at the point say , & # 8220 ; Eh ? & # 8221 ; ( read : Please explain or huh ? ) Let & # 8217 ; s take surveying planets : before you can grow your empire you & # 8217 ; ve got to find planets in the vastness of space . The way it & # 8217 ; s handled is you draw as many cards from the planet deck as one less than the number of survey cards in your hand . Got three ? You draw 2 planets . Look & # 8216 ; em over , consider and weigh them and then pick the won you want to show up in your empire . Letss say you chose the role of survey , well you get to add a survey card to your hand , now you have four ! You can pick and choose from more planets now , leading to better planet discoveries . The poor guys who don & # 8217 ; t have at least two survey cards in their hand can abstain and draw a card from their deck to help them for the next role selection.The roles are : *Survey Described above*Colonize One method of making a survey planet one of yours for points , trading opportunities , or other bonuses . *Warfare Second method surveyed planets become yours*Produce/Trade How you make or sell goods for points*Research Buy cards to add to your hand that help in role phase for either of two rolesPrior to choosing a role , you have an action phase . This is when you can actually subdue planets . Or use a research card to trash cards from your deck so they won & # 8217 ; t come up again . Used in the action phase , the survey card will let you draw two new cards.There are a few end conditions . You run out of point tokens , or two piles of role cards are depleted . There is a last up opportunity till you get back to the start player . So everyone gets the same number of turns- even extra victory tokens ( different color ) that can be earned during those turns.As I said , points can be earned by selling goods and by subduing planets , but also by possessing of some research cards . Whoever has the most at the end wins.I hate to tell you what to do but & # 8230 ; Multiple paths to victory is the name of the game . I & # 8217 ; ve won going heavy on subduing planets , pushing an early game end producing and trading goods like crazy once I had four or five planets.Something to watch out for when colonizing a planet , don & # 8217 ; t embark on one that you don & # 8217 ; t have enough colonize cards for . These cards get tied up with the planet card and you need on in your hand during the action phase to finally flip the planet over . If they are all tied up there , you & # 8217 ; ll never be able to seal the deal . ( ok , you can buy a research card , and wait for it to be shuffled into the deck and finally be picked up . ) or you could just watch out for that sort of thing . The warfare method doesn & # 8217 ; t tie up cards- being a bit safer.ThemePerhaps it & # 8217 ; s apparent that I get caught up in the game . The little fighters are awesome and sometimes get flown from where they were amassed to the planet they are subduing before they get returned to the supply because , by gum , I & # 8217 ; m in space ! There & # 8217 ; s never any battle , just a threshold that needs to be met to subdue . The planets are pretty the cards are gorgeous . The resource chips , though variously colored to represent different resources aren & # 8217 ; t limiting if someone is hoarding them , but they are kind of plain . I suppose you might take this out of space and then you are looking for islands to conquer instead ? Man-o-wars are probably more expensive to make than the little fighters.BalanceMost games have felt pretty close that I & # 8217 ; ve played . You may look over at someone & # 8217 ; s empire and see they have many more planets than you but hopefully you are thinking , yeah , but my stack of tokens from trade is a lot bigger than his while the third guy is smiling about the points from the technology cards . If you are woeful , and you might be your first time , then if the shoe fits & # 8230 ; InteractionThis game encourages interaction . You & # 8217 ; ve got to tell people what role you are doing so they can do it too . But after that , my empire might as well be in a parallel universe . I can & # 8217 ; t survey your planets . I can & # 8217 ; t send my ships to your planet to steal your or destroy your goods , let alone take your planet and pleasantly trade with you . That would be a fantastic expansion , says I.Learning CurveMedium . At least when I & # 8217 ; ve taught people the idea of tapping a card to affect the roll before or after it happens seems to be a sticking point , mostly because there are only two kinds of cards that go before a roll and you are used to tapping all the rest of the cards after you roll . Once you get past that , then there & # 8217 ; s the analysis paralysis for those who struggle with the idea of multiple routes to victory . Which of all those cards should I try to get ? Happily the opening options are limited . The options increase as people warm up to the game- hopefully getting the hang of it.DowntimeNot much at all . You are either getting a new card or doing a role . Sometimes it takes a while for them to choose their action and unless they announce what role they are doing you could see them doing an action and jump the gun . ButWhat & # 8217 ; s not to Like ? The prude in me strikes again : My permanent marker helped me a bit with the Artificial Intelligence card . Really ? I grinning guy looking forward to time with a metal-clad winking female shaped robot ? Except the forced interaction previously described , it & # 8217 ; s even more solitaire-like than Puerto Rico . At least there you can shaft people by claiming a boat or two and cause them to throw their goods in the drink or buy the building you know the other guy needs or sell the good to the trader they have so they can & # 8217 ; t. Yes , that & # 8217 ; s how I play that game . I like to think of it as defensive playing . Yeah , that & # 8217 ; s it . But no room for that in this game . I guess my mom should really like it . I guess there could be a race for the really cool tech cards but & # 8230 ; that & # 8217 ; s pretty weak.AdaptationsDon & # 8217 ; t let the wee ones touch it- ok , they & # 8217 ; ve played with the fighters and the 1/8 & # 8221 ; thick planet cards . I & # 8217 ; ve bought two copies of the game so that up to 8 can play . And I think- for an expansion that you should be able to scout neighbor & # 8217 ; s planets and trade with them and attack them . Add a card called planetary defense that lets you beef up defenses on a planet . If you trade with a surveyed planet you get two points and put the good on their planet and they can sell it .	1
Who does n't want to be an alien and abduct earthlings ? My Kids LOVE THIS GAME.It 's a roll and press your luck dice game . There inst much strategy but it 's Pure Fun ! ! ! PARENTAL NOTE : It 's a Bottom of Purse Game.Meaning it travels great there or in glove box of the car or put it in the diaper bag for the older kids . IF you are stuck waiting anywhere -RESTAURANTS , the Doctor 's office , Dentist , airport , for the bus/train , in a Long Line or even if you go camping you have a small quick fun game to distract yourself and the kiddo 's while you wait.I love this game and Zombie Dice for that . This game though for me ranks a little above Zombie Dice as it offers a little more in choices and risk . Zombie Dice does play different enough though that it 's also worth looking into we own and like both.Educational well only if one was to study the mathematical statistics of the game , even more so if you compared it with Zombie Dice . The game alone , well there isnt any educational value to the game , it 's just fun to play.From 1 Parent to Another ! Get the game and keep it for outings .	1
Great theme and the artwork ( what little there is ) is awesome . The gameplay is fun enough , but sometimes it takes a little too long since I always push my luck !	1
Albeit there is lots of luck involved , the game offers enough choices to really have fun . It 's one we take on hikes and to restaurants .	1
Martian Dice is light , filler/family style dice game for two or more players that 's been designed by Scott Almes . In the game , you take on the role of alien scientists who have come to earth to capture various kinds of earthlings as a means of learning more about life on this planet . If you succeed in capturing the greatest number and variety of earthlings , you 'll be the winner ! But it turns out that abducting humans , cows , and chickens is not as easy as it looks ! At its heart , Martian Dice is a push-your-luck style game that 's had a dash of set-collection thrown in for good measure . With a good amount of points in hand , should you roll that one last dice in the hope you 'll score a cow to get a set of three and thus up your score an extra four points ? Or is it not worth the risk , in the event that rolling a tank will take you out and make you score nothing at all ? This press-your-luck element accounts for much of the appeal of the game.Surprisingly for a game of this style and weight , there 's also a definite element of strategic choice , certainly more so than you 'd find in dice games of a similar type and weight . Granted , there will be occasions where you roll so many tanks that these decisions are taken from you , because all you 're trying to do is get enough death rays to survive , but for the most part there are choices to be made , and you wo n't simply feel you 're at the mercy of Lady Luck.Martian Dice is a very accessible game with simple rules , and it also plays quickly . It 's not hard to see that this clever dice game has got a lot going for it , from the wacky theme and funky dice , to the press-your-luck dice rolling that incorporates just the right amount of decision making . It 's light , has a great push-your-luck factor , plays quickly and is genuinely fun to play . A hearty two thumbs up ! - EndersGame @ BGG	1
its a game night favorite , its a lil stratagy and a lil luck to this game but very fun ! Its a lot like the Zombie dice or chupacablra all great games alone weve also mixed in a die from other games and made up variations .	1
This is a great game for all ages ! We have played with people from 4 years old up to 50 so far ! It 's addicting & we NEVER play just once ( or 2 or 3 times ! ) The dice are great quality & look amazing ! Do n't get too greedy or you 'll get NO EARTHLINGS & NO POINTS ! ! hahaha	1
This is a quick , but fun game . Simple to learn , and not your ordinary dice rolling game . Yes , it 's a lot of luck , but it 's also a lot of press your luck . Some of you enjoy pressing your luck , anyway , so try your hand at this !	1
Only played it a few times . Games can be long and rules take a while to learn , but there 's a lot of diversity in what happens and it has some fun mechanics . Does n't seem to be heavy on player interaction , but there 's a nice competitive feel ( unless you play cooperative ) .	1
Like many , this is the most expensive board game I have ever purchased . It is well worth it , as it is also the only one that we have played 10+ times and still look forward to . This is my favorite board game right now and has been for a long time , toppling Artifact which held that position for many years . The game play can be daunting at first , as it is complicated to get going , but once you do start playing it goes pretty easily . This game could best be described as Indiana Jones for D & D . The best thing about this game is that it has a simple , yet still invigorating version and then goes up from there . Each version incorporates new and different aspects to the game and aspects from each version can be intermixed into whatever version you are playing depending on how complicated you want to make it . It is almost like a board game with 3+ expansions included for free and this really lends to its replay factor . It also lends itself to house rules very easily as well without messing up the mechanics of the game . In my opinion this should be the number one board game of 2012 , it is that much fun . It is also one of those rare games that can play up to 8 players and is still a blast for everyone . The only problem I have with this game is I would have liked to see a painted miniatures version or expansion for it . However with a little practice and some patience you can paint the figures yourself . If you only have $ 75 dollars to spend on a board game ( I paid $ 100 for mine and after playing it would have paid more ) and you love games and/or Indiana Jones themes , purchase this , you will not be disappointed , just give yourself some time to read through the instruction manual ( it does come with a 2 sided IDIOTS version that explains everything for the simple game ) a couple of times .	1
This is a very cool mega-game . I say 'mega ' because it has so many neat pieces . The components are all high quality , including the plastic pieces for heroes and villains . The board is wonderful , it has very nice art and large spaces for the pieces . Each hero gets a very thick and large hero cardboard card . The rules are well done , and all of the pieces fit nicely back in the box.Fortune and Glory is a fun game . It is kind of like an Indiana Jones type of adventure . There is combat , and the enemies are nicely varied . Each hero gets to travel the world in search of Fortune and Glory ! I had my sister order this for me through her Amazon accout . Fortune and Glory the board game is fun to play !	1
The game is littered with all the tropes of the pulp era , including various enemies including American Mobsters and of course the Nazis . This particular installment of the game seems to celebrate the Nazis most given the addition of things like the Nazi Zeppelin that travels around the map and releasing Nazi soldiers in its wake.And of course the game would not be complete without villains - the enemy equivalent of our heroic characters . There are both Nazi and mob villains in the game that seem to be equally immortal . Of course one never truly kills a pulp villain - you only defeat them long enough to get away and possibly fight another say.Depending on whether you 're playing a competitive game or a cooperative game , you 'll have different goals for the amount of Fortune points ( acquired by selling artifacts ) individual players need or the group of heroes need . But to help you in your quest , there 's also another type of currency called glory , which is typically earned through defeating enemies and can be spent on equipment like guns , and airplanes or allies like a faithful dog . Fortune = victory points . Glory = more conventional cash.The learning curve is a bit trickier than other Flying Frog games , but once you get it things run pretty smoothly . It helps to have players who are familiar with the pulp genre and understand the inherent campiness with some of the aspects of the game . It has the same cheesy photography that we 've come to love in other Flying Frog games and it even has a Cartwright character ! And while the main board is static ( given it is a map of the world ) , the Flying Frog folks were able to come up with alternative ways to make the game modular in order to increase replay value . First , the artifacts are created using two cards from two different decks that mix and match names in interesting ways . Then random locations are determined through a separate deck of cards.Lastly , there is pretty much something that can possibly happen to your character each and every turn . Even when you 're just moving around the map , you have to take time to check for events and other encounters that help keep the turns interesting . But naturally the big goal is to go on adventures and seize those artifacts - and we even do the big old style radio voices as we plunge into the deep.Fortune & Glory : The Cliffhanger Game is a brilliantly versatile game with significant replay value and a lot of potential fun . Admittedly it 's not a game for everyone and we 've had instances when the pulp genre just was n't something that people could embrace . But it 's still a great addition to any game collection , especially given the wide range of players it can support . Good 8 player games are pretty rare .	1
Oh man , words dont do justice to how much I love this game . I 'm a huge fan of the series and this game does justice to the best show . Doesnt matter how many people you have playing , each game is an epic story . Unlike most games they even have a single player mode that I find myself playing just as much as I do with friends . Each time we play we get better at the subtle rules and have more and more fun every time . I highly recommend this to anyone who has watched and love the firefly show as much as me .	1
Originally posted on [ ... ] , a new idea everyday ! Product : Firefly the Board GameProducer : Gale Force NinePrice : ~ $ 60Set-up/Play/Clean-up-3 HoursTL ; DR- Take me back to the black ! 90 % Basics : Time to see the Verse ! This game is based on the popular , cancelled-too-soon television show . Now , you need get to get a job , get a crew , and keep flying . Each turn a player can take two actions . These actions must be different . The actions range from moving your ship , doing/starting a job , shopping , or getting new jobs . You can either move your ship one space or burn fuel and move up to your engines & # 8217 ; speed . Moving the full amount also makes you draw event cards from an event deck for the type of space you & # 8217 ; re in , either the central space or the outlying regions . These events can range from nothing , to & # 8220 ; finding & # 8221 ; salvage , to having the reavers attack your ship . Jobs form the bulk of the game . As an action you can start a job . When you start a job , you must be in the location indicated on the job card . Starting may entail picking up a passengers , fugitives , cargo , or contraband . Later , at any point in the game as an action , you can finish the job when you get to the right planet . When you want to finish a job , you must have and pay the amount of items needed . You may also have to do & # 8220 ; Aim to Misbehave & # 8221 ; card ( s ) . The Aim to Misbehave cards give you several options to succeed . Usually , you have to add up the number of skill icons your crew and objects and add a die roll or have a key word/item to succeed . When you finish the job , you get paid . Also , when you finish a job for an individual you completed the job for , you also become solid and get extra options with that person . Shopping lets you look through a deck of cards at a planet or draw random cards and buy two of them . You can buy fuel , cargo , crew , and ship upgrades to keep your ship flying . Dealing lets you draw two jobs from a deck of a specific job deck when on a planet . Players compete to complete a mission . Missions range from pulling off a heist to getting a lot of money . Often these missions have multiple parts and require going to multiple planets and misbehaving . First one to complete the mission wins the game.Theme : This game oozes theme . You feel like you & # 8217 ; re in the Firefly universe . You get to go to iconic places and meet people from the show . The game pieces , mechanics , and board all help with this also . For me , this game sets the bar for theme for games going forward . 5/5Mechanics : The game has some simple mechanics that really help with the theme . The random encounters , aiming to misbehave , and missions all feel like they belong on the set of Firefly . The game also has some simple resolution mechanics with the simple dice roll plus numbers . Those are all great , but parts of this game are completely broken . The companion captain is amazingly broken by getting free crew . Some items and crew are completely overpowered . Some combinations are completely unbeatable . And this game has a runaway victor problem . That doesn & # 8217 ; t kill the game , but it does hurt the game a bit . 3.5/5Instructions : The instructions are clear and well written . I liked what I saw and was able to figure out how to play pretty quick . I did have some questions , but these were not game ending questions like some games . Heck the instructions have that mix of modern and cowboy slang that was famous from the show . 4.5/5Art/Execution : This game has some of my favorite parts of any game . This game has Firefly universe money and its real cash ! You don & # 8217 ; t know how amazing that is till you hear it slide against each other and feel it in your hands . The other pieces are great too . I liked the art . It & # 8217 ; s all feels like it just & # 8220 ; fits. & # 8221 ; 5/5Summary : This is right up there with my favorite games of the year . I get lost in this game , in a good way . When I play , I get so wrapped up in the world and doing jobs that I forget about the game wining mission . Heck , most of the other players do to . That & # 8217 ; s the mark of a great game . When you want to keep playing so much that you don & # 8217 ; t even want to win , you just want to keep playing . 90 %	1
I thought this game would rely so heavily on the theme that the game would be very ordinary . After two plays I really enjoy this game . The theme is dominate which helps to setup each mission . It can take a long time to play , especially with new players . At its heart it is a point to point pick up drop off game . With some random elements to mix things up . There is very minimal player interaction , you can poach crew members from other players under certain circumstances . It feels very similar to merchant of Venus but different enough that it can stand on its own . If you loved the tv show you will like this game , if you did n't follow the show then you might not get into the theme which is what really holds the games together . I was very impressed with how much stuff they managed to fit into such a small box . Component quality is good .	1
When a board game is made from a show you love you never know how it will turn out . I was so worried this would be a pasted on theme with just pretty pictures of the cast . All fears aside I think they nailed this one.Components are great . Mechanics fit the theme . I really feel like I am flying around the verse doing jobs , trying to avoid the reavers , avoiding the alliance , getting in solid with guys , upgrading my ship/crew , and making that money ! My only complaint is the moving mechanic seemed to slow things down . If something stopped your moving , which happened often , you were stuck waiting until the next turn . We had 4 people in the game I played and it always took awhile to get back to you.I 'm so glad I picked this one up .	1
Great Firefly Fan Fun , Great production values , well thought out interior box storage , and very well thought out rules make this board game a great addition to any gamers collection . I 'll be buying any expansions that follow . No gripes here !	1
Thematic and engrossing experience , but effectively multiplayer solitaire.Very enjoyable for a hardcore firefly fan . Not so much a great game , independently.Do not , under any circumstances , play with 4-5 players . Time will stop .	1
I got this for my 7 yr old son to take with us while we traveled for the holidays . I worried it might be & # 34 ; boring & # 34 ; to him in comparison to his DS , his books and such . But he played this with me over and over . I was so grateful for it while we waited 5 extra hours in the airport . The pieces are attached , which is great for not worrying about losing them , but they are held on very tightly and we had to work hard together to turn them over . Do n't know if they 'll loosen up over time .	1
We love all the meliss and doug travel games . Pieces can be a little hard to flip , but that 's what makes them so durable and hard to break . It will last a long time !	1
Received this as a gift for my 6 and 8 year old on the road ... ..perfect ! With grandparents it kind of starts a `` conversation '' where they can come up with a word , or my kids can , and gets things going around while waiting for food at a restaurant . Trying to entertain them and stay in their seats when they have nothing to do is simply not realistic , so things like this really make a huge difference ( tic tac toe as well ) . And at $ 12 you will not be annoyed at the price . Totally worth every penny . Yes , I 'm annoyed the pen is already dried out , but yes , any Sharpie will do . Wish it came with at least 2 replacement pens , would have paid at least $ 1 each for them since they have the cool eraser at the top ( no need for a tissue ) . A great product !	1
I purchased this game to be used during a trip with my granddaughters ages 6 and 8 . They loved the game so much that one of them asked that I purchase another one just for them for their birthday . It is a great tool to assist them in broadening their vocabulary and spelling skills while enjoying the competition of a game . It is easy to play and understand . Melissa and Doug have designed a visibly appealing and durable product with all parts attached to the one board eliminating the chance of losing pieces .	1
We bought this for traveling and using in restaurants while waiting for food . The letters are a little tight on there so can be hard to turn for people with larger hands but has n't been a real issue and we 've used it a lot . Highly recommended !	1
We all love Melissa & Doug toys..the only reason I didnt give this one 5 stars is that the bands holding the pieces are really tight ( they do begin to stretch a bit as the game is used ) and it caused a few & # 34 ; owies & # 34 ; for my grandson as we started to use the game ... the bands seem to stretch a bit over time	1
This is a very creative game . It is sturdy and built out of the traditional Melissa and Doug wood . It is rather noisy though . When you flip the letters the wood on wood slap hurt my younger daughter 's ears when playing in the car .	1
This is a great way to play hangman . No wasting of paper and it 's so solid it can be used anywhere . My six year old grandson likes to play this in church . The only drawback is the snapping sound of the `` tiles '' as they are turned over . I took care of that by putting self-adhesive felt tabs on the backs of the `` tiles '' . That does n't work on the printed side , but I 'm going to try some clear rubber `` dots '' for those sides . Of course an adult can turn the tiles over without making much noise , but the younger ones have a harder time if they are n't very patient . If noise is n't a factor , then you 'll like this a lot .	1
When my husband saw this game he said , `` I know our granddaughter , and she is going to love this game . '' We got it along with several gifts for her 8th birthday , and this was her favorite . As soon as gifts were unwrapped , she wanted to know how to play it . It is so easy , she was playing after one example of how it is done . That was two days ago , and we are told that she is still playing it every chance she gets . At least two people have to play . ( One person chooses the word to guess , and any other players call out possible letters . ) One really nice feature about the game is that it is designed so there are no loose pieces , aside from the erasable marker , and even that has its own storage spot where it attaches to the side of the game . All tiles containing the letters and the parts of the `` man '' are on strong elastics that permit the pieces to be flipped over and back as needed , and can not be removed ( or lost ) from the board.Children will develop not only spelling skills , but will become familiar with other aspects of grammer as well . And they wo n't even realize they are learning because they are having so much fun . Our granddaughter already knows to look for a vowel in the words - and what the vowels are . A hint to the person who is guessing also might include whether the word is a noun , verb , etc . Of course this game can still be played the old-fashioned way ( i.e . with paper and pen ) , but there is something about putting it on a board that gives it fresh appeal .	1
I love Melissa and Doug products and this is no exception . This is a great travel toy because the tiles are all attached to the board and you just flip them over . The only pieces you can lose are the marker and its lid . The marker is n't great quality ( the tip was smooshed in five minutes ) but we just replaced it with our own dry erase marker . The worst thing about the travel hangman is that the tiles are incredibly annoying when you flip them over . Loud noises are bad enough when you 're in a large room , but in a car where everything seems much louder , ugh ! The kids pick a word and then start guessing letters and SNAP ! SNAP ! with every letter guessed . And THEN , when they erase it to start over , SNAP SNAP SNAP for every letter they have to flip back over . I 'm highly sensitive to noise because I get headaches really easily so others might not be bothered by it , but gosh ! It drives me crazy . Still , it keeps them busy , it helps them learn to spell , and the snapping is better than listening to them ask , `` Are we there yet ? '' I 'm glad we have this toy !	1
Melissa & Doug know just how to make things special for kids and easy for parents . This version of Hangman is great in that there are no pieces to go missing and it 's easy to pass back and forth between parent and child or child and child . All of the pieces are attached with a type of rubber band that allow you to flip the letter or body part over but they never come off . The erasable pen stays clipped to the side and has a built in eraser in the pen tip.You can do this with a beginning reader 's sight words and spelling words . You can choose vocabulary words for test studying for an older student or just free play . And there is something pleasing about the sound the tiles make when they are flipped over and make their 'thwack ' noise.Lot 's of fun for a beginning reader to just about any elementary age child . Durable , fun to look at and versatile .	1
Overall this is a great toy , it 's fun to play and pretty good for travel.First small issue was that the marker did n't last nearly as long as I figured it should . The other is the loud snappy noise that the letters and body parts make . I 'm too conscious of it to let the kids use these and other similar Melissa & Doug games on an airplane , and in the car it 's really annoying , especially when they inevitable move from playing with it the correct way to just flipping all the pieces back and forth just to make the noise .	1
This toy has absolutely saved us this Christmas.We had a four-day trip planned , but an unexpected snowstorm snowed us in for more than 2 extra days.Now , I have little boys . And for the most part , they are self-entertaining . For a while , we cut snowflakes . They read for a while . They made ramps out of books for their Hot Wheels cars and Bakugans to sail over . They got antsy , and I threatened to make them start writing their thank-you notes , so they drew pictures . We got out in the snow . We thawed out . We shoveled out the car a few times ... and we played Hangman.This version has been played with for at least 3 hours , non-consecutively , on this trip by my six-year-old . He will wheedle anybody into playing with him . He 's a good enough speller/reader to make it fun , and his favorite is when you give him the lines for the first words in a Christmas song he knows . This has saved me , because ( of course ) he is not the only person who wants my attention . So his job is the erasing and flipping over all the blocks job after every game , which lets me handle other things as they arise.The hangman game board is made of wood , with sturdy bungee cords holding the tiles on the board , a section of white board , and a white board marker . High quality ; fun for little people to use ; self-contained . I suppose the board could be used to clobber a brother , but no other part of the toy could function as weaponry ( a plus in long-car-drive situations . ) I am going to keep it in the emergency bag in the car . This toy saved my week .	1
This is the BEST game . It is a necessity for travelling in the car , or anywhere there is a wait with the kids . All letters are attached , and FLIP when named . The bottom is a dry erase board . NO MISSING PIECES OR CLEAN-UP . Helps with vocabulary & spelling .	1
This is a great toy for the car . We 've had hours of fun with it and my 7 year old loves it .	1
Great piece to take along for rides or trips - nice and big enough for a 7-year-old to work with , and great size to take along in the car !	1
My kids love this but the tiles can be hard to flip sometimes . Make sure to always put the cap back on the pen as it dries out pretty fast if you do n't . Overall , it 's a fun game that we all play whether in the car or at the dr. office waiting .	1
This is a great way to play hangman , especially while in the car ! I guess if I had to find a fault with it though I would say that giving the kids a marker in the car is not something that I am particularly fond of . My kids are 3 , 8 , and 9 . The three year old does n't play this yet but likes to steal the marker from his sisters & doodle on the whiteboard portion of the game . The 8 & 9 year old do great with making up words for each other and playing the game . I like the fact that the & # 34 ; man & # 34 ; is already designed for you so there is no guessing how many other & # 34 ; parts & # 34 ; can be added before he is hung because he is & # 34 ; all there & # 34 ; already . I also like that the marker has it 's own storage spot on the side of the board and that when the marker dries out , it can be easily replaced with other whiteboard markers or whiteboard crayons .	1
I got this toy with the idea of taking it on a long plane ride . However I had to use it earlier for a long car trip . It was great and kept 4yr old very occupied . I didnt know it was a wooden toy before I got it , now I doubt if I can take it in my cabin baggage ? But a great toy overall .	1
This was a token gift for my sister 's grandchild . Keeps the little girl busy on car rides to and from events she attends with the family . It 's quiet , so she can play it during these sports events without disturbing anyone else .	1
My nephew-in-law got engaged and the last couple of Christmases Jessica got gifts from me from The Body Works which was good , but this year I gave her this game and she went nuts . She brings it over every time she comes . My husband and I have played this for years . It is one of the very few games that is good for 2 people . You just use 40 cards instead of the whole deck . If you are looking for a good game for 2 people , this is it . Each hand is quick and you can stop at any time . You can earn bonus points if youare lucky . What more could you ask ?	1
It looks almost the same as the original game that I played with years ago.We play teams and love this game ... ..so happy we could find a new one .	1
This is a fun game for kids and adults to play together . It is really just rummy played with a rack instead of holding the cards in your hand , which makes it easier for kids . I think it 's a good way for younger kids to learn numbers as they always want to play what everyone else is playing .	1
I first played Racko more than 40 years ago . It 's an easy game to learn and to teach to fairly young children . But it 's not just for kids . Despite its simplicity , it 's an exciting challenge getting all your cards in the rack in numerical order and it takes some thinking and a bit of strategy . This is a game the whole family can enjoy .	1
I tried this at a friend 's house and it was awesome ! The premise is simple , keep exchanging cards until you have a run of 10 . Just because it sounds simple does n't mean it is , this game requires strategy and is surprisingly difficult at times . Lots of fun for kids or adults .	1
We have so much fun playing this game with our Grand son . Helps him with his Math too . Ca n't find this game in stores anymore .	1
I owned this game as a child . Loved it then , love it now . I play it often with my husband and children .	1
We played this game when I was a kid . Even then , I loved the logic that you have to apply . So , I recently bought it for my kids to use . It 's one of those games where the kids are actually thinking and doing some math , but they are having so much fun , they do n't realize it 's brain work . I definitely recommend it !	1
I grew up playing this game with my Grandma . Now I 'm having a lot of fun teaching my kids how to play . Quick game that does n't last all night but allows a little family competition . My husband , 11 year old , and 7 year old all like it . Great family time .	1
My 7 year old got this about 10 days ago , and we 've played it several times a day ever since . We both love it -- it 's one of those great games that spans ages and is fun for everyone . Highly recommend !	1
Played this game at a board game night and have a lot of fun . Bought it but have n't had a chance to play mine but I know it was fun for all .	1
Got ta love this simple , classic game . I Orderd this game for my girls for Christmas and was happy to find its just like the one I used to play with as a child . It 's a perfect game for teaching number sequencing and recognition . It 's also a nice quite game , for the most part .	1
This game is a great addition to my travel pack . I take it camping and we have played it many times without complaint . Another blast from the past . Loved playing this game as a child and love it as an adult .	1
My husband played this growing up and we continued the tradtion with our children and now grandchildren ! One of our top favorites ! We gave it to all our grandchildren for gifts too .	1
I love this sort of games , with which kids can be creative and use their brain , and can share time with adults around them as well .	1
I played this game endlessly as a child and bought my 9 year-old granddaughter one for Valentine 's Day . She loves games and we are having a great time playing it ! ! ! This game is a & # 34 ; word search & # 34 ; in a fun format and encourages kids to find larger words while they are enjoying a game . I highly recommend it ! !	1
Boggle is one of my families favorite games and this one made it even more fun ! Boggle is already hard , but Big Boggle makes it even harder to get all the words available , actually impossible . There will be games when only a few words will be found by more than 2 players , there are just so many options ! I love it .	1
My whole family loves this game . It 's one where even the youngest ( 6 ) can play . We just allow her to follow a different rule set then for the older . Shake it up and look for words . You only have 3 minutes so write them down quickly .	1
I have been playing Big Boggle for years . It had been discontinued for several years and my old set , after being used consistently over the years , had started to wear . For Xmas a couple of years ago , my husband bought me a new set from Ebay for an outrageous $ 75 new . When I saw that they had reintroduced Big Boggle , I bought two additional sets.Big Boggle is an addictive word game . While it is touted as a bigger version of regular Boggle and you can find bigger words of four letters or more , the reality is that you can come up with some huge words without reusing letters . Confirmed Boggle-maniacs will tell you that at times you can find yourself thinking about words and whether you 've encountered them before on the gameboard.While I 've noticed that this is a great game for anyone who thinks their memory is going and it definitely stretches a person 's word knowledge and spelling skills , it also really helps kids with their spelling skills and vocabulary . My kids started out with regular Boggle and moved up to Big Boggle . Being competitive helped , but it did a great job reinforcing what they learned from a variety of subjects and improved their visual coordination .	1
I purchased this game for my classroom . It is very durable , love the larger size . My students lost interest in it very quickly , but I think that could just be their aversion to anything that could slightly resemble education ; If you love word games , this is a great one to add to your collection . My family has had a lot of fun with one .	1
I had n't played Boggle in decades and then my dear friend brought out her original boggle set and we started playing all the time . I was so excited to get my own and therefore bought this one . I really enjoy it and how it stimulates my brain . What I also love about it is that my 7 yr old loves it ! ! The first time he played he only saw one word , but he did n't give up and now he can find up to ten . He 's even finding words I did n't ! This game is fun and educational . My family plays it at least weekly .	1
We 've had a lot of fun playing this since opening on Christmas day . The cubes are made of a high quality resin ( ? ) that does n't feel cheesy or cheap . The larger letters allow my child with visual spatial issues to more easily see words as she tries to build . All of the letters that may be ambiguous ( m , z , n etc . ) are clearly marked as to which side is down . Great strategy game that also builds vocabulary and spelling etc . Great buy that will get lots of use !	1
My kids and I have always enjoyed Boggle , so I bought this game for one of them for Christmas . It 's a fun game , and can be played by kids as well as adults . Each round does n't take long , so it can be played when you only have a little free time .	1
my mom has been a boggle lover for years and this was a great addition to her game collection . the bigger letters are easier to see and make the game more fun . makes a great gift	1
My mother is a boggl-a-holic , so I bought her the 5x5 `` Big Boggle '' last Christmas and she loves it . We found a greater variety of words during each round we played and challenged each other to find longer words than we ever had on the smaller version ( we have a four-letter minimum in our house , even on the 4x4 ) . Now married and living in another city , I inherited the 4x4 . It felt constraining to downgrade ! While we still enjoy playing , we miss the 5x5 for its capacity for longer words and more creative plays , while still being just as challenging.It 's also easier for younger players to find more words they recognize . This means the kids feel involved , practice spelling words , and the adults still have fun searching for bigger words . They also like shaking the box in between rounds . It 's a great game to play as a family .	1
Maybe it was nostalgia , but when Big Boggle showed up as a lightning deal this past Christmas , I just had to order it . I have to say that this newer version is better than the old one from my youth.The 5 by 5 grid enables you to make longer words than ever before . One of the letter cubes now has commonly used two letter combinations such as , Th , Qu , Er , and In . The blocks themselves are a good size and the font is crisp , large , and easy to read.Since you start with a larger board , you are supposed to find words that are at least 4 letters long . Since I play this with my children , I let the 8 year old find 3 letter words too , while the 11 year old has to find at least 4 letter words and I have to find at least 5 letter words . The 5 year old even gets in on the fun ; he likes to spell out words on the grid when we are n't using the game.When I played as a child , I noticed that after a few rounds we kept using the same words over and over again . Now , with the additional 9 cubes , I notice the variety of words has increased dramatically . When playing with a skilled group you can really get some highfalutin words on the lists , which makes the game a lot more fun.I know that spell check has destroyed my ability to spell , Boggle is just the thing to force me to brush up on my skills . If you like word games , or want to help your kids improve their spelling in a fun way , then Big Boggle is a must buy .	1
The tile lock addition makes this a lot easier to use . You do n't have to worry about tiles going all over the place , it is a great buy !	1
This is a good version for the kids . The plastic locking pieces keep the game board from being shuffled or sliding if kids get to excited .	1
Bought this for family fun night . My 8 year old is having a wonderful time working on his spelling and we are having a wonderful time playing the game . Love that the pieces do n't slide all over .	1
It tells you so in the description , but it 's still smaller than I expected . Still works great and tons of fun though !	1
Always played scrabble when I was young and now I can play with my grand children to teach them the game and have hours of fun with them .	1
This toy was a great gift for my little friend named & # 34 ; Abbey & # 34 ; . She loved it ! I am so glad that I found it and bought it for her .	1
My daughter is a fan of Sesame Street and Abby is one of her favorites . I was very happy to find this version . I did n't want a & # 34 ; talking & # 34 ; mechanical doll , I wanted a soft cuddly friend that my daughter could snuggle and play with . This fit the bill exactly . The skirt is a little delicate and has torn in a couple places but for the most part Abby has kept up with my 2 year old and they have had lots of adventures together !	1
Abby is beautiful and my one year old LOVES her . She has not even seen her on TV , but she instantly fell in love with Abby . This Gund `` doll '' does n't sing or make any noise . But if you have ever purchased Gund before you know the quality . I searched high and low for this Abby at a good price , and Amazon beat them all !	1
I think that this is an adorable doll . My two year old picked it out at a store and I bought one for a few of my friends kids for christmas . The only issue I have with it is that she has pulled off all of the top layer of the dress and it is not an easy material to fix .	1
Its a nice size and nice doll ... but the skirt is made of a shiny fabric that is already falling apart . I think my daughter has only had it for two months . Guess we will be getting a new one soon .	1
Our kids ( 6 , 5 , and 3 ) are fans of the muppets . Our youngest ( 3 soon to be 4 ) wanted a stuffed doll ; we found the muppet plush dolls and she was in love with Abby . A good size ( 12-14 inches ) and super soft . Just what she wanted . Next up on her list , the Elmo doll in this series .	1
I bought this doll for the 1st birthday party of a sweet little girl connected with our local Christian School and in our church . She was becoming interested in the character , so I thought the doll would be a great present for her ... ... and it certainly was . She takes it everywhere with her , including to bed , sits in her Princess chair with it while she watches an Abby video . It made her day .	1
if your child likes sesame street and/or Abby Caddabby , then you 're doing them a disservice every day this toy is not in your home . i WILL give your kid access to Child Protective Services contact info if these are n't sold out today . ( reminder : must purchase from AMAZON.com only ) : )	1
Abby is a very hard character to find . This is a great doll and I am glad we purchased it for our daughter .	1
My daughter is 19 months and drags this doll around all the time . It 's very well made , very cute and looks very similar to Abby on tv . We also bought Grover , Cookie Monster , Elmo , Bert and Ernie . They are all worth the price on Amazon . We hear our daughter say 'Abby ' all day and she hugs the toy a lot ! Gund is the way to go for Sesame Street dolls .	1
ABBY CADABBYThe Easter Bunny brought Abby to our two year old granddaughter this year . Abby is one of Paige 's favorites on Sesame Street . When Paige saw little Abby sitting in her Easter basket she screamed ABBY ! and has n't let go of her since.Abby is made very well , very sturdy and durable . She is a GUND , so you know she is of high quality . Her outfit is bright and shiny , her little mouth has a heart in the center of it . She is cuter than you can imagine and a doll that any little girl would love to own . She comes complete with her wand ; how could she function without it ? Abby has a good and happy home now . Get one for your special little girl . We did ! Thank you ! Pam	1
Bought this for my grandchild . Have n't given it yet , but this is really cute . Seems well made . Should last a while .	1
I 've read mixed reviews on this product , so I thought I 'd just see for myself . Considering how much my daughter ( 2 and a half years old ) adores Abby in Sesame Street , I figured she would love this as well . I imagine Gund has taken past criticisms into account ( or I got quite lucky ) , but the doll we received was well made and adorable . My daughter spent a day studying the doll ( not sure what criteria she was using since she cant really verbalize it ) and it seemed to pass her scrutiny as well . The dress seems okay ( one of the primary complaints was regarding its flimsy manufacture and potential choking hazard ) . From my observation , the doll is soft , cuddly , and doesnt seem to be a hazard at all ( at least where my daughter is concerned , but she also doesnt gnaw on it like I imagine a lot of kids are prone to do ) . She simply totes Abby around along with her Elmo doll , sets them up in poses , sits them down to watch tv with her , and generally plays with the doll just like I figured she would . I 'm quite pleased with the purchase overall.I did only give it four stars because , as nice as it is , I think the likeness could have been a little better , but overall , I think this is a very nice toy for toddlers .	1
Abby Cadabby has been a member of our household for some time now and she is adorable . Overall , she has held up well , except for her outer , shimmery skirt . The petals started falling off one by one and now they 're all gone . We have not had any problems with her wings though .	1
Great purchase for lovers of the Sesame Street character Abby Cadabby ! . My granddaughter loves it and was excited to get the doll along with an Abby Cadabby book .	1
Abby looks great ! Her dress is adorable , sweet wings and the wand completes it . Excellent purchase for sesame street fans .	1
She is the cutest doll and my granddaughter just loves her . She is one of her favorite dolls to play with . Got it for a great price and quickly .	1
By now , Munchkin has become something of an icon in the non-electronic gaming world . The game play is relatively straightforward : ( 1 ) collect cards that give you points , ( 2 ) flip over cards that depict monsters , ( 3 ) compare your points to the `` level '' of the monster , ( 4 ) defeat the monster or attempt to escape ( depending on the results of your points comparison ) .Each card contains its own set of rules that affect game play , so each card contains ( often substantial ) text.The game is fairly flexible in terms of the number of players it can accommodate , but somewhere between 3-5 is probably best . If you stick to those numbers , a game will usually take around 30-45 minutes.This core game is also compatible with any of the ( many ) Munchkin expansions , so a player may consistently add new cards to the deck in order to breathe new life into the game.Overall , the play is very fun , portable , fast-paced , and often amusing.APPROPRIATE AUDIENCE : Hardcore gamers will enjoy this as a `` warm-up '' between their more complicated gaming sessions . It 's a very useful tool for introducing newcomers to these kinds of games ( although Fluxx or Current Number of the Beast are maybe even better for this purpose ) . Finally , this particular set is absolutely `` fantasy geek '' centric -- in other words , if the player does n't enjoy ( or wo n't understand ) Dungeons & Dragons and Lord of the Rings jokes , you are better off getting a different set of Munchkin cards ( Star Munchkin for sci-fi fans , Zombie Munchkin for zombie fans , etc ) .OVERALL SCORE : B+ ( at this point , the game is too venerable to consider anything less ) .	1
Fun game with easy-to-follow rules . Dozens of variants if you do n't like the genre . Quick games , too . It is a clear hit and a great gift for those who like games like Settlers of Catan .	1
This is a great game for an evening with friends or family . Reasonably easy to learn . Can be a bit cut-throat at times . Has a chance at ending friendships .	1
I was introduced to the world of Munchkin six or eight months ago by some role-playing friends . My first game of Munchkin was fun but ... a little difficult . I was n't able to read the rules beforehand , and they were all experienced players , so I was just kind of dropped into it and left to my own devices and observations to figure out the mechanics . I had no real idea what was going on , and it was a little confusing . I made several costly errors based out of ignorance , and that left me a little bent and a bit puzzled . Not the game 's fault , simply a lack of adequate knowledge/preparation . But I still had a good time with it.By the second game , though , I 'd asked enough questions and largely figured out how the game was supposed to be played . What a difference ! This game is a riot ! Munchkin is touted by its makers , Steve Jackson Games , as a role-playing game without the role-playing . And that 's exactly what it is . A card game parodying the the typical role-playing game . It has most of the elements of all good traditional role-playing games ( races , classes , magic items , baddies to fight , levels , etc ) , but there 's no real role-playing involved . You play the cards you 're dealt , you fight , you go up levels , someone wins . Along the way , though , you get doses of great humor , mostly poking fun at traditional `` serious '' RPGs , and you constantly work to strike a balance between helping your friends ( which almost always helps you , too ) and back-stabbing them to get ahead and ( hopefully ) win the game . A very munchkinly thing to do.This game is an absolute blast to play . Since that first game day some months back , I 've lost track of the number of times I 've played . I 've bought my own set along with several expansions , and I now play regularly with my two boys , ages 12 and 8 . They love it , too . We have a great time , and because of its volatile but lighthearted and whacky nature - you can go from being juuuust about to win to being without a doubt the low player on the totem with the play of a single card - no one seems to get upset whether they win or lose . Perfect ! We all have a fantastic time . There is plenty of strategy involved , but the strategy is not so difficult to grasp that an eight-year-old ca n't pick it up quickly . You may be a little shaky on the rules/gameplay your first game . Bear with it ; once you get the basics down , the rest is icing - the game will flow more smoothly , and your enjoyment will grow tremendously.Most games take about an hour , and by the time it ends , that 's enough for a little while . You 'll be Munchkin'ed out for a bit but left wanting more in a day or two . The way a great game should be . Best played with three or more players to get into the real strategy and munchkinness of the game , but my 8-year-old and I occasionally play just the two of us , when my 12-year-old ( who is 12 going on 16 ) decides to act like a teenager and be antisocial . The game still works fine with two people ( and is actually often much faster to the finish ) ; you just do n't get quite the depth of play as you would with at least three . ( Not that I 'm calling Munchkin deep . Part of its great fun is that it 's shallow . ) I now own the original Munchkin set , expansions 2-6 ( all full expansions with 100+ cards each ) , Fairy Dust , Waiting for Santa , and Marked for Death ( mini-expansions with 15-20 cards apiece ) . And I 'm currently waiting on my deliveries of Munchkin 7 : Cheat with Both Hands , Monster Enhancers , Munckin Reloaded ! , and the new Munchkinomicon . I also have Munchkin Cthulhu , which is a complete game in itself that can be ( and is , in my household ) combined with the original Munchkin , along with Cthulhu expansions 2 and 3 . We ca n't get enough of it , and more cards are always welcome ! If you 're new to the game , or are looking to introduce someone to the game , I do recommend taking the time to digest the rules before diving in ( or giving someone an opportunity to read over the rules before having them take the plunge ) . This will serve two functions . 1 ) It will give the new inductee a chance to grasp some of the game mechanics before being forced to make potentially bad decisions without ANY clue what they 're doing ( they probably still wo n't have much of one the first time out , but hey , it 's not your fault now - you gave them the rules , right ? ) . And 2 ) It will give a newbie a glimpse into the terrific humor the game is immersed in , which is a big part of what makes the game so much fun . The rules , by the way , can be downloaded in pdf form at [ ... ] . ( Uncontrollable website plug , my apologies ) .A WORD OF WARNING : Those who take their role-playing too seriously and ca n't laugh at themselves should probably not play . This game pokes fun at everything.Enjoy !	1
We LOVE Munchkin and all the versions . This is the first one , and a classic . My other favorite is the cowboy version . We also own the zombie and pirate ones , and have played Cthulu , and they are all fun.This is a game with a large sense of humor . It can be played with as few as the people and as many as about 7 . You will pick up the game after a few rounds . I teach my middle schoolers to play , and 12-14 year olds LOVE this sense of humor . If you have someone who really only likes realistic fiction , this is probably not the game for them , but anyone who has ever dorked out on fantasy , or has an irreverent sense of humor will like it.Once you have played a few games , it can be a really cutthroat strategy game , or just a fun game with the gang . The other really fun thing about this game is that all of the different versions are compatible , so you can combine decks and play as zombie/pirates or space/cowboys or whatever . That just makes it sillier .	1
I think Munchkin is a great game , BUT its not serious AT ALL , and if you go into the game wanting something serious and challenging , then you are going to be disappointed . HOWEVER , if you want a zany game where you get to screw over your friends and kill ridiculous monsters , armed with even more ridiculous equipment , then this is the game for you . Like many other games , this game is largely based on luck , so if you draw badly , the game can seem nearly impossible , but if you draw well , then you can coast to victory .	1
This a a great game for the card loving role playing game enthusiast . This game allows you to have fun creating characters and defeating monsters . You certainly can not stop laughing with the witty cards and hilarious illustrations . I would recommend this game to all those looking for a fun game and a great laugh !	1
This is an awesome game ! The humor is very fun and a bit twisted . I love the Chain Mail Bikini ! It 's great for playing in a diverse group of people . Fantastic for a great night of fun with friends .	1
This is the Non-Deluxe Edition of the awesome game , Munchkin . It has all the same stuff as the Deluxe edition , save for the board , the figures , and the female/male cards . Although you can play without all those things , I would not suggest it as it gets very confusing very fast . The game is a bit difficult to master , but it is well worth your time and effort ! The monsters are hilarious and the rules are obscure so indulge in some healthy arguments as you play . It 's good practice for your next friendly facebook debate over the superiority of certain ice cream flavors as well as your stance on current gun control legislation.Bottom line : go get this and learn how to play it ! It 's worth your time . Heads-up , you 'll need 3-6 players , so go make two friends before making your purchase . ( SIDE NOTE : If you 're having any trouble learning how to play , go watch TableTop on youtube . )	1
A really fun game that I get `` stuck '' playing due to one of my younger nephews . At age 5 he could n't read the cards so we played open hand so since we had to help him read his cards , he could see ours as well . I was surprised at how fast he memorized most of the cards by the pictures , and actually corrected me on some game play . He 's now 7 and we can keep our hands secret , and he 's only gotten better.After getting back into board gaming , I immediately checked out the dicetower.com review that Tom Vasel does and I noticed one of his pet peeves about the game was the luck involved ( if it involves dice , yeah , there 's going to be some luck ) but I do n't agree to the level of luck implied . During the game you are going to come across different race and class cards , determining how you play . If you take the lead , you are most likely going to be ganged up on , keeping the game close at the end ( something games like Settlers of Catan get praised for ) . I could go on why I like this game so I will list what I think is the biggest CON for this game.CON : The price . This game is WAYYYY too much for a deck of limp cards ! For the same price or less , you can get `` Forbidden Island '' in a tin box w/ exceptional colored art and pieces . I paid around $ 20 for each Munchkin expansion . The newer editions are in `` color '' but in the transition , one of the expansion decks I ordered was not the new `` colored '' decks , and cost just as much.You may want to get card sleeves for these , as they are pretty cheap cards , considering if you buy the main set and 4-5 expansions , you are looking at $ 100 w/ shipping . A pretty large investment for a card game . Understandable to some extent but not a bargain compared to other games .	1
... I am sure this game is as awesome as they say , but it was impossible for me to figure out how to play without someone around who already knows the deal . Since I have no one like that and have n't bothered to get online and youtube it , I have not played it yet .	1
Munchkin is one of those games that starts with a really simple premise and works its way into a hillarious and elaborate experience . The game is almost entirely card based , and it comes with everything you 'll need to play . The gameplay itself is fairly simple , and most people will have a good working knowledge of the rules after a sample round or so.Be warned , Munchkin will be enjoyed most by people with a working knowledge of Dungeons and Dragons and other such fantasy stereotypes . This is n't a difficulty concern , but these folks will be most likely to enjoy the game 's humor . There are a ton of inside jokes and references here that may fly over the head of the average ( non-geeky ) player . Even so , the game is fast paced and funny . The art style is simple but enjoyable , and I think most players will have a hard time going through a game without smiling.All in all I think this is a great little card game for a group of people from small to medium . It 's easy to pick up , and no two games will go the same way .	1
These cards are fantastic , even speaking as a fan , the detail , quality , vibrant color & beautiful artwork , makes these a must have .	1
This is a fun game of both cooperative and competitive play.I love this game but do n't take my word for it.Watch a game of it being played. ( ... )	1
We 've only had the game for a few days , but so far we 've played it a total of six times , you figure each game is one hour long , so basically we 've gotten six hours of fun for the affordable price of under twenty bucks . So , way less than we 'd spend if my family went out to see a movie and best of all , we did n't even have to leave the house.A little bit about the game , it seemed a bit complicated at first.We followed the directions , give each player four cards each from the two stacks , that part was basic , but we ended up folding and unfolding the game play instructions trying to figure out what to do next.Basically , each player tries to level up . Levelling up can be achieved in just a few ways , 1. defeating a monster ( which you can only do if you have enough levels , which means you may need to , 2. buy a level , by selling magical items or 3. get a level up treasure card.The game seemed a bit slow at first because each player starts with just one level which is too low to start fighting monsters . But the game picked up when we 'd all gotten to level three . The monsters can be defeated by more than one player , so one minute I was sabotaging my son 's chances at winning another level , the next we were fighting flying frogs together and sharing in the loot ! The cards themselves give you directions , telling you to add 5 to fight a monster ( very useful card to use against your opponents ) or that certain magical items can only be used by certain characters ; dwarves , elves , etc.By the time we played a third time , we knew the game well enough to start levelling curses at each other and how to steal each others treasures.Munchkin has a lot of extender packs , munchkin zombie , munchkin the guild ( I just bought this one , yay ! ) etc . that add to the original game set.Since we play a lot of games here at home , monopoly , settlers of catan , telepathy , zombie dice , risk , etc . figuring out the basic rules was n't terribly difficult , but I think looking at a few munchkin blogs could prove helpful ( yep , there really are munchkin blogs . )	1
We went over to a friends house , and were introduced to this great game , I loved it so much , I bought it for us , and now have 1-7. still need 8 . There are other varieties , and expansions to add to this base game . We now have Munchkin Game Night weekly , and are invited to another place to play once a month . We are totally addicted !	1
I 've known the game Munchkin for a very long time , and have always thought it was of the most ridiculous , yet one of the most enjoyable games to play . It 's very simple , and even non-gamers can pick up the rules real quick . Play goes by very quickly , and the cards are pretty damn funny.This game is best played with a group that has an interest in fantasy , as the jokes are definitely inside jokes . However , they 're likely to be the people most interested in the game to begin with.The newest edition has all the cards in color , and this is a very nice touch versus the older editions . Definitely makes it feel classier . However , unless you 're putting the cards in sleeves , it 's still a card game , and is still less durable than other types of board games.Overall , buy this game , call over several of your buds , and be ready to kick down the door , kill the monster , and backstab your friends , for Munchkin is as good as ever .	1
The game Munchkin pokes fun at table top role playing games especially players who are less interested in actual role playing/story telling and simply want to fight monsters , get stuff , and levels.The goal is to go from level 1 to level 10 defeating monsters and accumulating stuff along the way . Each time you successfully defeat a monster you gain a level and collect treasure cards which are items that may help or hurt you . If you are unable to defeat a monster you can attempt to run away . Failing to run away results in `` bad stuff '' as printed on the monster 's card.You start with 4 cards at level 1 as a classless human . Cards on the table are items that are in play for you which can be race cards ( halfing , elf , dwarf , etc ) , class cards ( warrior , wizard , thief , etc ) , and weapons/gear . When you are ready to fight a monster you `` kick open the door '' by drawing a card from the monster deck.To defeat a monster your level ( 1-10 ) plus any items you 're equipped with determine your fighting ability and that number is compared to the number on the monster 's card . If the number is higher you win and gain a level . Some classes like warrior can win on a tie . If you are unable to win the fight you may choose an item in your hand to help you out.Adding to the fun and replay value of the game your friends can have cards in their hands which make monsters harder to fight causing you to lose and run away . Likewise friends may aid you but might expect some of the treasures in return.There is more to the game than this such as gold to buy levels , etc but that 's the game in a nutshell.It is fairly simple to play and does n't take long ( probably 30 min - 1 hr ) . This is great into game for people getting into table top games or those who want to learn the basics of Munchkin before trying something more involved like Munchkin Quest.My wife is n't big into table top games but this one she has actually played and enjoyed playing .	1
Munchkin is such a great game ! I love it ! This is the starter game , which you should buy first . Buy the expansions later on .	1
I 've never played Dungeons & Dragons ( which this game is a satire on ) , but I am a huge fan of board games and card games . Munchkin is a great game for 3 or more people who do n't mind being geeks for a few hours . The game combines a heavy dose of D & D satire , witty puns , pop culture , and mild adult humor . The object of the game is to outfit your character with an arsenal of unusual weapons , items , and abilities in order to slay monsters and gain levels . Your friends are doing the same , and you can benefit from both helping and hindering them . The rules can be a little daunting at first , but players pick it up quickly . Plus , all of the cards have explanations on them . With the exception of `` The Need for Steed '' , the expansions add a great amount of variety to the cards without making the game longer or more complicated . `` The Need for Steed '' does add a small amount of complexity to the game , but does not make the game longer to play . Although playing with 2 players is technically possible , it is a very different experience and does not compare to playing with 3 or more players .	1
Excellent game !	1
This game is heavily linked to the role-playing game Dungeons and Dragons . You can enjoy Munchkin in and of itself , but it 's best served for oldschool D & D ; fans who 've spent many a long night playing games and now want a more light and silly alternative to pass the time.Munchkin 's rules are simple . You play an adventurer , out to kill monsters , grab treasure , and gain levels . Whoever hits level 10 first , wins ! But beware , players can backstab and sabotage each other , not to mention there 's plenty of trading and table-talk allowed to create strategies for working with ( and against ) each other.Each player starts the game as a generic human adventurer- in role-playing terms you have no race , and you especially do n't have any class ( the humor is n't terrible high-brow , you see ) . You start each turn by kicking down a dungeon door ( drawing from the Door pile ) , and confronting the monster or trap within . You may then look for trouble ( play another monster from your hand ) , or loot the room ( draw a card from the Treasure pile ) . As you play , you amass gear and items that all basically boil down to plusses and minuses . So you might be a Level 2 character , with a +1 sword , and a +1 armor , making you effectively a level 4 character in terms of attacking ( but you 're still level 2 in terms of winning ) . This total must be higher than the moster 's level for you to win a battle.So- You bash down a door , and encounter a level 3 monster when you 're effectively level 4 ( or , 2+1+1 ) , so it 's an easy win . Until , another player tosses the monster a potion that gives it a +5 , and suddently you 're a level 4 character attacking a level 8 monster . You rub elbows with your buddy to your left and ask for help , and he decides to join the fight . He adds his 5 levels to your 4 , so that level 8 monster is going down ! Until , of course , one of you gets backstabbed by the thief , so now both of have to roll to run away else you 'll suffer the consequence ( described on the monster 's card ) . People who 've never played D & D ; before may just see a mess of numbers in the previous story , while seasoned D & D ; veterans should see all the complexity of the tabletop game boiled down to its meat and potatoes . It 's fun either way , but it 's fun-ner when you 're `` in the know '' .Late in the game , players will have amassed piles of helmets and potions and armor and magical swords , and it all gets wonderfully complex without being overwhelming . You can only win the game ( with a few exceptions ) by killing a monster.So when you 're level 9 , and you flip a monster card , it 's essentially you versus the table . Victory only comes if you can get some cooperation from your fellow players , or if everyone else is just completely out of ways to stop you.There are some issues with momentum- a player can catch some big breaks early on and get the best equipment so they rocket up to level 9 in a hurry , but the ability of the table to work against someone keeps this to a minimum , so long as everyone at the table is keeping tabs on everyone else . This does lead in to the fact that , for all the numbers and power-gaming , this game winds up being about cooperation . If all the players just let someone get away with building up levels , then one player can win in a hurry . It 's nice that you can balance things this way , but it can also be incredibly frustrating when you 're the player with all the best stuff and you keep getting foiled by small-time abilities other players use to chase away your monsters or foil your attacks.The whole experience is a ton of fun , and for long-time role-players , its a real trip down memory lane that 'll have everyone at the table saying `` Hey , remember that one time ? '' for hours on end . This game is vaguely okay for children , with the worst language on the cards being `` a** '' and `` b*stard '' and a few crudely drawn images of girls in chainmail bikinis to watch out for , but overall this game should be fun for people of all ages and all levels of familiarity with D & D ; .	1
This game is a satirical role playing card game . Very good for those new to role playing games , or those who are well explored ! I also really like that there are so many expansions for fresh material .	1
You can be an ally one turn , and an enemy the next . fun and comedic , some of the cards takes time to understand , but once you get used to the game . Its fun and laughs will happen .	1
Years ago while talking about games one person commented that a certain game was a perfect `` beer and pretzels '' game . The game in question was simple to play , had lots of off-color humor and while it clearly did not take itself all that seriously , was seriously fun . His comment started a converation about what other games might fit that category.Munchkin could be the sibling to those old games . Even in this first set , the puns are everywhere and the game is more about having fun and socailizing than winning . Sure it almost requires that you backstab each other freely , but its also the kind of fast paced and humorous game that keeps the players from becoming too serious about what 's happening . The idea is to have fun , winning is just a bonus.The humor can be crude and a bit adult , but other than that Munchkin has proved to be a great game .	1
I really wish I went with the deluxe version to get the playing pieces and game board , but still a lot of laughs	1
... this card game is simple , fun and a riot for any person who has ever played D & D , In Munchkin you are dealt a hand of cards . Each player starts off as first level , you play items and draw cards , and when you see a monster you fight it , and what monsters , The Potted Pland , the Drooling Slime , the Plutonium Dragon , the stoned Ogre , you get the idea.You are helped by items such as Don the Horny Helmet , Boots of Butt-Kicking , the singing and dancing sword , but beware , the people you play with might help the monsters to help themselves to your treasure . They may help you instead , for a price that is.It is very simple , if the strength of your weapons and level combined are higher than the monsters level ( enhanced by your foes ) you win and get treasure cards and go up a level or you can buy a level for 1000 gold by selling items.The game is fast paced and very tounge - in - cheek . The maker says it `` captures the essence of the dungeon experience ... with none of that stupid roleplaying stuff . `` Simple , fast paced and full of fun , buy this one ...	1
I expected this game to be a hilarious take on popular role playing games , like Dungeons and Dragons . And it really did turn out to be just that . Munchkin will appeal to fans of RPG 's , but also to those who have always just made fun of them as well , thanks to the comical bent.The only reason I 'm giving this game four stars is because of how difficult this was to initially get going . If you read through the rule book , you 'll quickly find yourself overwhelmed and left with two questions for every answer the directions bring to mind . Everything is there , but the ordering of the instructions is very strange and vastly confuses things which really ought to be simple . The best advice I can give is to not think too much about having all the rules down before you jump into the experience . Give yourself and your crowd a test run , just to get a feel for what can and ca n't happen . This should make your life much easier than the rule book will if that 's where you intended to start.This game has very few things to really wrap your head around . You 've got some cards , need some poker chips ( or coins of any type ) for counting your level , and ... yeah , that 's about it . Moving pieces and mass game boards disappear with this little treat of a game . Once you 've played a few rounds , it makes for a quick and easy game to dive into . And is also easily put away . Even the price is lower than I 've come to expect for this type of game . So try it out . You 'll be glad you did .	1
Included with this review , is my reviews specifically towards Munchkin Booty , Star Munchkin , and The Good , the Bad , and the Munchkin . The reasons I have decided to do this , but will review other Munchkin games separately then this one , is I think the dynamics of these Munchkins can all be reviewed together , while I think the others require a more in-depth separate review.All players are given cards , and can put down items to represent two hands , one pair of feet , one body , and one head . Players can take class and race cards and place them as their character 's skill set.Players kick down the door ( draw a door card face up ) and then deal with the repercussions . If the card is a monster , players must face the monster . If it is a curse , players must resolve the curse . If the player did not encounter a monster , player may then loot the room ( draw a face down door card ) . If the player chooses to not loot the room , they may look for trouble ( take a monster card from their hand and fight it ) .Combat nets players treasures , which can give better weapons , and levels . Players win the game by getting to the tenth level.WHAT DID I LIKE ABOUT THE GAME : What I like about this game , more specifically this franchise , is it 's ability to cater to it 's fans . You like D & D ; , Munchkin . You like Pirates ? Booty . Space ? Star . Western ? GB & M . ; You name a theme , and given time they might have an ability to meet that love . For instance , if you are a fan of Firefly , you are more then welcome to get that feel of the show by mixing GB & M ; with Star . All versions of the game can be mixed together to allow a wide variety of items , classes and abilities.WHAT DID I DISLIKE ABOUT THE GAME : The main problem I have with this game , and really the only problem I have , is with the wrong people , this game can turn ugly . I 've seen friends of friends turn on other friends of friends , simply because they felt they were being picked on.In my opinion , it 's not the fault of the game at that point , it 's the fault of the players . The game lends to likely an ability for that to happen though.WHO IS THIS GAME DESIGNED FOR ? This game is designed for gamers . It 's the usual staple of a fun game when you do n't want to have to invest to much of your imagination , and a fall back for those who want something to do on a Saturday night.If you love games , and you have n't allowed yourself the ability to taste this game , then you are cheating yourself of a valid game play experience.RATING ! 7.2 out of 8 . It 's a solid game . My high rating though , to be honest could probably be a result of my unflinching dedication to Steve Jackson Games . If you want a more clear reason you should just follow my words listed above .	1
I tried playing and my eyes glazed over and I was so so lost ; meanwhile 6 kids sit down figured it out and ca n't quit playing . `` Oh , take a halfling from Matt '' '' I have borrowed swords . `` `` Does anyone have a plutonium dragon ? `` `` Do you have a wandering monster ? `` `` I have an illusion card . `` `` I have a nasty drooler . `` `` Can you kill it ? `` `` You 'll trade me 2 treasures for that ? `` `` Is anyone a warrior ? `` `` I 'm a warrior ; I would give you ... no , I 'm not going to trade my warrior . `` `` Let 's take a level away from Matt . `` `` I could make you an elf , Madi . `` `` I 'll just try to run away . I mean what 's the worst that can happen , I 'm dead . So , I can just escape from it . `` `` So , you lose your helmet . `` `` Hey can I be a girl instead of a boy ? `` `` Are you a cleric ? `` If you are looking for a great gift for a 13- 16 year old ( which is probably the hardest age bracket in the world to buy for ) you should consider this .	1
Our weekly DnD group had a set-back tonight , so we grabbed a copy of this from the local Target store as a stand-in . All of our guys were quite entertained by this game , and it served as a great temporary stand-in for a sorely missed DnD session . I would highly rate this for a gaming group looking for an engaging and fun distraction . The variety in the play of this game is excellent , and while it 's easy to grasp , it is n't easy to win ... especially with a group of gamer 's that will `` stick it to you '' . The backstabbing is quite fun , and most gamers would get a kick out of the humor . Overall , a definite thumbs up for gamers out there !	1
By now , Munchkin has become something of an icon in the non-electronic gaming world . The game play is relatively straightforward : ( 1 ) collect cards that give you points , ( 2 ) flip over cards that depict monsters , ( 3 ) compare your points to the `` level '' of the monster , ( 4 ) defeat the monster or attempt to escape ( depending on the results of your points comparison ) .Each card contains its own set of rules that affect game play , so each card contains ( often substantial ) text.The game is fairly flexible in terms of the number of players it can accommodate , but somewhere between 3-5 is probably best . If you stick to those numbers , a game will usually take around 30-45 minutes.This set CAN NOT be played as a standalone game but is rather a ( fantasy themed ) expansion to the original Munchkin core set ( although it is also compatible with any of the many Munchkin sets and expansions ) .Overall , the play is very fun , portable , fast-paced , and often amusing.This expansion adds a number of amusing cards to incorporate additional variations and twists on the game , and for the most part is a welcome addition to the core set.Note that this particular expansion set , like its core game counterpart , is fantasy themed -- in other words , if the player does n't enjoy ( or wo n't understand ) Dungeons and Dragons and Lord of the Rings jokes , you are better off getting a different set of Munchkin cards ( Star Munchkin for sci-fi fans , Zombie Munchkin for zombie fans , etc ) .OVERALL SCORE : B	1
If you 're new to Munchkin , I recommend checking out the original Munchkin and its reviews first for game play , mechanics , and feedback . Especially my review . It 's a good one . ( Shameless self-promoting - I have no pride . ) Munchkin 2 is an expansion of the original Munchkin . It 's not a complete game in itself . It provides no new variants to game play , no extra aspects to consider , no new rules . It 's just more cards . More items , more monsters , more humor , more cool stuff.BUT ... more cards means less card repetition which makes the game more fun and definitely increases the replay value . And the new bits of humor on the cards is worth the extra cost alone . Size ( of your deck ) matters.Munchkin is awesome . Buy this . Buy it now .	1
Munchkin is a wonderful game for the card loving role playing game enthusiast . It is a great game in that there are an infinite combination in the cards making every game more unique with every expansion that you add to it . I would recommend unnatural axe to you .	1
I originally wrote this review forMunchkin 2 Unnatural Axe Revised Edition . So , please excuse me if you read it twice ( but , I thought I 'd include it here as well since I did n't know where folks would start ) .Unnatural Axe is a 112 card expansion for the Fantasy Munchkin theme . It contains 64 door cards ( plus 2 bland door cards so you can create your own ) and 44 treasure cards ( plus 2 blank cards ) . It also adds on new race ( Orcs ) , bringing the total to 5 if you count humans . The number of cards and the fact that it adds a new race really adds to the variety and replayability of the game . You do n't need a ton of expansions to get the most out of the base game , but the base game and least two are definitely worthwhile investment . I own all of the Fantasy Munchkin expansions , and if I were to recommend an order to get the most new variety for your dollar , I would suggest Munchkin 3 followed by Munchkin 8 followed by this one.Note , SJG recently re-released in a Special Edition of Unnatural Axe . It 's not available on Amazon yet , but hopefully it will be soon . It contains everything in the regular Unnatural Axe , plus a set of six female pawns that were originally only available here : Bag O Munchkin Plus 6 Babes .	1
This non book expansion card set for the non-book game of Munchkin adds 112 new cards . More wierdness and tounge-in-cheek humor for old D & amp ; D players and young alike.I still do n't know why these are listed as books but it still does n't matter , buy them . Remember this is an expansion deck , you should own Munchkin before buying this game . ( Yes game NOT BOOK ) But you CAN read the cards ... ..	1
By now , Munchkin has become something of an icon in the non-electronic gaming world . The game play is relatively straightforward : ( 1 ) collect cards that give you points , ( 2 ) flip over cards that depict monsters , ( 3 ) compare your points to the `` level '' of the monster , ( 4 ) defeat the monster or attempt to escape ( depending on the results of your points comparison ) .Each card contains its own set of rules that affect game play , so each card contains ( often substantial ) text.The game is fairly flexible in terms of the number of players it can accommodate , but somewhere between 3-5 is probably best . If you stick to those numbers , a game will usually take around 30-45 minutes.This game can be played as a standalone ( sci-fi themed ) set and is also compatible with any of the ( many ) Munchkin expansions , so a player may consistently add new cards to the deck in order to breathe new life into the game.Overall , the play is very fun , portable , fast-paced , and often amusing . The jabs at well-known science fiction films are all very entertaining . However , note that this game was released before the rise of Battlestar Gallactica , Lost , and the recent resurgence of Dr. Who . So some audience members may be disappointed their their favorite sci-fi show is n't represented.APPROPRIATE AUDIENCE : Hardcore gamers will enjoy this as a `` warm-up '' between their more complicated gaming sessions . It 's a very useful tool for introducing newcomers to these kinds of games ( although Fluxx or Current Number of the Beast are maybe even better for this purpose ) .Finally , this particular set is ( obviously ) sci-fi themed -- in other words , if the player does n't enjoy ( or wo n't understand ) Star Wars and Star Trek jokes , you are better off getting a different set of Munchkin cards ( Zombie Munchkin for horror fans , Conan Munchkin for fantasy fans , etc ) .OVERALL SCORE : B ( at this point , the game is too venerable to consider anything less , and the sci-fi theme is very well done ) .	1
If you like the idea of trading cards , making deals , making alliances , stealing treasure , and stabbing your friends in the back you will love this game ! Everything about star munchkin is fun ! It is fairly quick , always interactive , and not too hard to teach to newbies . This is one of those games I have played since I was young and will always love . Try it out with friends who are willing to laugh and wo n't get angry when you turn on them last minute to win the game . : ) Buy it .	1
If you are looking at buying this game , you have already bought or at least played the original Munchkin game ( s ) . If not , stop , do not pass GO , buy the first Munchkin and start there . This is a great add on to the Munchkin series . The game plays the same as the others with very few variations . So , in that case , it is great . I do n't think the folks at Steve Jackson Games had their hearts in this one as much as the other Munchkin variations . If you are a completist and want the whole set , by all means pick this one up . If you like the fantasy aspect of the original and hold no particular fascination with Sci-Fi , you might consider saving your money . If you are looking to utilize the Munchkin Blender ( a separate purchase ) , these cards come in very handy . There is also a sequel card set , Clown Wars . SJ Games is the king of stretching the gamers for every penny so know what you are getting into when you make that first Munchkin purchase .	1
I find Munchkin to be a fun game to play every now and then . I started withMunchkin Deluxe , and liked it so much I decided to branch out to a couple of the variations . I 'm glad I did because Star Munchkin is my favorite theme of the Munchkin franchise ( I also own Fantasy Munchkin and The Good , The Bad , and The Munchkin ... and have played Zombie Munchkin a few times ) . The set includes 168 cards , including 94 door cards and 74 treasure cards . This set includes 3 races ( everyone starts out as human , but you can also be mutant , feline , or cyborg ) and 4 classes ( you can be a gadgeteer , psychic , trader , or bounty hunter ) . As with the original game , you ca n't take it too seriously . It 's not about winning , it 's about having fun along the way and appreciating all the SciFi spoofs . We laugh , we shout , we root against and sometimes even for each other . You try to stick it to your friends before they stick it to you . There are a lot of ways this can happen and I always enjoy seeing how it 's going to happen next .	1
Continuing with the popular Munchkin series of games , Star Munchkin adds a hilarious twist with this sci-fi theme . Have you ever wanted to attack a space alien with a & # 34 ; Laser-Laser-Mazer-Dazer-Bananananfofaser & # 34 ; ? Well , now you have the chance ! Great fun for any Munchkin fan who also enjoys such series as & # 34 ; Star Trek & # 34 ; and & # 34 ; Star Wars. & # 34 ;	1
Star Munchkin is a great game full of sarcastic puns of space movies like starwars and star trek . This is a standalone , so it is good to buy as is . It can be combined with any other munchkin game for more awesomeness !	1
This game is easy to learn and loads of fun . You can kill monsters , steal the treasure , stab your buddies in space ! Age recommended by Manufacturer -- 12 years and up.Age recommended by Amazon -- 16 years and up.I highly recommend this game .	1
Great game . I 've been looking for something like this for years . I love the way it makes fun of all the different major Sci-fi movies . It 's a great way to lose yourself In space without going there .	1
My wife 's son played this card game at an after school group . I thought he would like this game and make it fun for all of us to play too .	1
The standard Munchkin game is pretty simple . Start at level 1 with 4 cards . You `` equip '' yourself with items from your starting hand or won through winning fights with monsters . First one to level 10 wins.In quest its the same premise except for the following ( key differences ) :1 . At level 10 you have to fight a monster that will be a level 20 version of whatever you draw as the `` boss '' monster.2 . You have 3 actions per turn which allows you to move , search , or fight a monster.3 . There are dungeon tiles that you randomly connect to the game as you play . Each room may be advantages or disadvantages.4 . Monsters you do not defeat remain on the board and move into other rooms.5 . You start with 4 lives before you die and start over at level 1.There are some other added things but that 's the main differences between this and regular Munchkin.There are a ton more pieces ( dungeons , dungeon connectors , life tokens , action tokens , monster tokens , etc ) than Munchkin . It also might take a while to get used to the rules and keeping track of moving the monsters , how many actions you have left , etc.I found assigning people different jobs ( map maker , monster mover , action counter , etc ) helps keep everything running smoothly . Games can be short or long based on luck of the draw and how much everyone is messing with other players.The only con I have about the game is how unbalanced it can get with some card draws . A buddy of mine ended up with a helmet with a hand , the cheat card , ignore 2 hand weapon rule , etc so that by the end of the game his combat level was 36.Of course anytime anything is unbalanced you can come up with house rules so that next time which is what we did .	1
My grandson was so excited when he saw that he received this for Christmas ! Thank you for delighting one lad !	1
Munchkin Quest is a fairly faithful adaption of the popular card game for a board game format.As in the card game a big part of the game is stabbing your fellow adventures in the back . You will find many of your favorite monsters and weapons ready to play and big as life . Unlike the card game you find yourself in different rooms going your different ways.There is also a luck factor involved , as your level totals in combat are adjusted by die ( dice ) roll ( s ) . This extra bit of chance in the game makes it interesting.The rooms themselves are double sided tiles with different advantages and disadvantages based on race , class etc.Once you make 10th level you then have to get back to the entrance and do battle with a level 20th monster to win.It is a fun game with two jarring weaknesses.The first is the 4 player limit . You need to purchase an expansion to get to 6 . I know this is an industry standard these days but that really stinks.The second is time . The game tends to take a long time to play , particularly if you have skilled players playing to win . The game becomes a bit less fun if you are still fighting it out at 1 a.m.With smaller groups the time factor is lessened but either way the game is good and worth your time and money .	1
I 'm not sure people `` get '' this game , seeing it as a take on `` Munchkin '' rather than an homage to the original TSR `` Dungeon '' game . So many of the core mechanics echo that older game and the artwork carefully eulogizes it without infringing anyone 's IP . Clearly the work of someone who looked back on that original with fondness.The game itself is mechanically similar to the original Munchkin game , pre-expansion larding . ( The original Munchkin game clearly drew on `` Dungeon '' too . I never realized until recently , after replaying the TSR game for the first time in years . ) As such it suffers from the same weakness the original card game does - that powerful monsters can crop up too early in the game when they are either ignored or just too deadly . It is crucial for the players to understand the `` killing off a character '' rule here , which is different than the card game and important if one is n't to be bogged down with an unplayable character after a few unfortunate monster meets . That said , all the favourite monsters from that original card game are here.The monster movement can be difficult to remember if one does n't play often , but the rulebook is easier to read than most others and everything can be found quickly in my experience.Floor plans can become large if care and understanding is n't used when exploring & building the map . Real Estate crunch is always a problem on our small table . At my LFGS there is no trouble since they have large gaming tables for use by customers . We are n't talking Arkham Horror levels of real estate , but the map can get seriously big.The one problem I have that does n't go away is that when the dies were cut for the floor components , they were cut on a slight bias which means that if a floor and doorway are oriented one way ( out of four possibilities ) they fit together nicely and if not they do n't . I loosened up some of my pieces with an X-Acto knife , but they can become *too* loose if you are n't careful . I 've seen some people hammering their fists on pieces to get them to key together , but that just buggers up the edges of the keys . Sometimes what is needed is to couple the pieces from underneath . I 'm afraid the problem is in the manufacturing which does n't allow for the tolerances of the machine tooling used.Not a show-stopper , but annoying.Other than that I really like what they did with the concept here , and now I see the connection with the old TSR game I shall have that much more fun playing Munchkin Quest.Recommended .	1
Munchkin is a product line created by long time gamers , who know how games do , and should , work.It is no surprise that in their board game venture of their long standing IP Munchkin , they lived up to all expectations.Munchkin Quest is a `` build your own board '' board game . Meaning that every time you play it , the game will not be the same . This lends to multiple replays , and greatly increases the worth of the game.While some might say the only complaint of this game is that play can take long period of time , not all view it as a draw back . Few games can hold attention of players , constantly change , and live up to expectations over long prolonged games . Munchkin Quest is one of these amazing few.Anyone who loves to game , will love Munchkin Quest , and it 's original line , Munchkin Card Game .	1
This is a fantastic game ! Seriously , I did not think that I was going to like this game as much as I did . My friends are big video gamers and so I thought I would get this board game on sale on Amazon because I knew they would like a video game in a board game format . Once we brought it out and we started playing I could n't get enough of it . In all honesty , you can get terrible card draws and just be screwed over the whole game and never get anything good , or you can have terrible rolls and lose early , but the game is still very fun and exciting ! Turns do n't take very long and so there is n't that much downtime . It 's fast , fun , fairly in-depth , strategic , back-stabbing , and awesome !	1
Up front , this is totally a guy game.The rules are simple and the desire to keep playing is there . 2-6 players use three simple stats to move around the board attacking one another and using various cards that represent weapons , armor , power ups , and `` cheats '' . Play to a certain score , the winner gets an additional stat point.Form alliances , betray your friends , look the other way when it suits you . The combination of plays are almost endless.If you like small scale war games and are looking for something with a more individual approach to warfare this is the game for you.We even use custom maps ( think of those vinyl Dungeons and Dragons mats ) to mix it up after a few dozen rounds on the board it comes with ( which is double sided ) .	1
A friend of mine owns this and theFrag Gold Edition FTW Board Gameexpansion , and we enjoy playing it quite a bit from time to time . It 's pretty easy to learn and has an interesting game mechanic , so when I saw it for sale on Amazon for less than $ 15 , I decided to invest in a copy of the base game myself . Here are a few things I like about the game : ( a ) High quality components ... and LOTS of them ( b ) I have to mention the 6 plastic figures in particular because they look pretty cool and I also use them when we play Star Munchkin on theMunchkin DeluxeorMunchkin Level Playing Field Card Gamegame board ( instead of the figures or tokens that come with those boards ) . ( c ) The double sided map adds significantly to the replayability of the game . ( d ) So does the fact that it has 112 cards , including 34 weapons , 56 gadgets , and 22 special cards . We usually play 2-3 players , so things that come up in one game usually do n't turn up again until two or sometimes three or four games latter . ( e ) You get to roll LOTS of dice . It comes with 18 six-sided dice , but sometimes you need even more . It is very fun when you get to roll that many dice.The main thing we do n't like about the game is that you can drop an empty weapon on one turn and pick it up fully loaded the next turn . Because of this , and on a related note , we typically remove ( or limit to one time use ) the portable nuke weapon since this combo really breaks the game for us . In spite of this , it is a fun filler game that is definitely worth trying , especially if you can get it for a great price .	1
Do you like shooters ? Do you like board games ? Well , then this is the game for you ! Get your nerd on with this Steve Jackson game that combines the mechanics of an fps with a game board reminiscent of CLUE . Spawn , collect gear , then try to kill your friends , what more could you want ? !	1
A game of Deathmatch in Quake , Halo or any number of other First-Person-Shooter video games is where players play against each other ; the winner has the most kills . It & # 8217 ; s gloriously wanton and carefree & # 8211 ; shooting everything that moves within your field of vision . Twitch-gaming at its best.Now take that concept and unplug . It & # 8217 ; s no longer a computer or console game & # 8211 ; it & # 8217 ; s on a table , with cardboard and plastic pieces , and dice . Lots of dice.Wait . What ? Welcome to Frag & # 8211 ; Gold Edition , by Steve Jackson Games . & # 8220 ; Frag is a computer game without the computer , & # 8221 ; according to the introduction in the light , 4 page rule booklet . Clearly , we are not talking about deep strategy , here . It & # 8217 ; s a gutsy , go for the glory type of game and if you die , well & # 8211 ; wait to respawn and have at it again.As for the strategy vs. luck involved in winning , I present this evidence : The game comes with 18 ( ! ) 6-sided dice . And consider this amazing fact & # 8211 ; 18 dice will not always be enough ! Couple that with 118 randomly drawn game cards , and well . It is guts over strategy . That will put the & # 8220 ; serious & # 8221 ; gamers off , and this is less like Chess and more like Risk . Or Uno & # 8211 ; except you kill the other players.For a game of this type to work , it has to play fast and Frag does as long as no one takes things too seriously . The brief rules are clear and well-written , but leave MUCH unsaid about specific situations , and require a degree of game-savvy and ability among the players to decide on & # 8220 ; house rules & # 8221 ; for circumstances that are not covered in the instructions . I chose to look at that as just another intriguing aspect of the game . If you ( or your gaming group , or even one person in your gaming group ) *MUST* have officially documented and complete rules , give Frag & # 8211 ; Gold Edition a miss . For those who can lighten up and address ambiguous situations as they arise without it bringing the game to a complete standstill , read on.Each player has 3 stats : Health , Speed and Accuracy . You get 7 points to divide this among the attributes , as long as each stat gets at least 1 point and not more than 4.There are also 3 different cards in the game : Weapons , Gadgets and Specials . Each player starts with 1 of each , and has opportunity throughout the game to draw more . These cards add a lot of flavor to the game and are often humorous.The Special cards are fun and emulate online gaming experiences . The & # 8220 ; No Carrier & # 8221 ; card means a player is immediately dropped from the game and has to respawn . The & # 8220 ; Lag & # 8221 ; card causes a player to miss their turn . & # 8220 ; Extra Ram & # 8221 ; card allows the player to have 1 extra card in their hand , and so on . This is in keeping with the theme and holds up very well.A player & # 8217 ; s game turn consists of 3 phases : Check for RespawnRoll for MovementMovement , which consists of multiple possible actions : Move\jumpPick-Ups ( attempt to grab an item on an adjacent square ) AttackThese phases are straight-forward and resolved with dice roles , sometimes modified by the effects of a played card . After a player finishes his turn , it goes to the next player who does the same . The game is over once a player has scored 3 frags.Basic math skills are needed & # 8211 ; addition , subtraction , multiplication and division are frequently used , but the equations are not difficult . I & # 8217 ; d say they were a good learning tool for kids to learn math , but the subject matter might be too violent to consider it a family game.The game components are great . The board is double-sided and made of thick chipboard , as are the die-cut counters for pick-ups and bullets . The cards are good stock and have rounded corners and the art is interesting and well-themed . The player boards where stats are maintained are dry-erase and reusable . 1 dry-erase pen is included ( additional dry-erase pens recommended ) The rules are brief and to the point . And it includes 18 d6 dice , which will be enough for most rolls , but you may have to do 2 separate rolls on occasions where more dice are required . The game needs a lot of dice.I bought the game on Amazon for less than $ 15 , shipped ; a bargain , and I don & # 8217 ; t know how long that will continue . For those looking for a fast-paced low-strategy game that finishes in an hour or less , Frag fits that bill very well . This one won & # 8217 ; t gather dust on my shelves .	1
Originality -- * This game is very original . It is a boardgame representation of a computer or console FPS ( First Person Shooter ) like Halo or Call of Duty . Like an FPS , the game is fast-paced , random , and often unpredictable.Rules -- * The rules of FRAG are very well written . You can easily sit down and play the game as soon as you get it because the Frag rules are easy and fun to read . You will not be required to spend hours deciphering and learning the rules just to play a game.Components -- * The components are quite nice . The map boards are double-sided , colorful , and well-detailed . The 6 plastic miniatures are both brightly colorful and cool to look at . All of the cardboard tokens for marking ammo usage , dropped items , and frag locations are well-made and colorful.Theme -- * This game has a huge amount of theme potential . The play is fast and colorful cards replicate the types of weapons , armor , and equipment one finds in FPS games . Another set of cards provide those experiences we all know and love from online shooter games like `` Dropped Carrier '' and `` Lag '' .Cool -- * Overall , this game is very cool ! It can be used as a toolkit for making any kind of FPS-themed board game . How could you not think it was cool ? Bonus -- * There are other games in the FRAG family and even online support at Steve Jackson Games . This game is fast-paced enough that it has helped with my son 's game playing and sportsmanship . FRAG has taught him the concept of `` reversals of fortune '' and that being down is NOT the same as being out.Total -- 6/6 Stars This game is incredible family fun . If you like computer or console shooters and board games , then you should buy this game . You will love it . My son and I really enjoy blasting each other , again and again , all evening long .	1
By now , Munchkin has become something of an icon in the non-electronic gaming world . The game play is relatively straightforward : ( 1 ) collect cards that give you points , ( 2 ) flip over cards that depict monsters , ( 3 ) compare your points to the `` level '' of the monster , ( 4 ) defeat the monster or attempt to escape ( depending on the results of your points comparison ) .Each card contains its own set of rules that affect game play , so each card contains ( often substantial ) text.The game is fairly flexible in terms of the number of players it can accommodate , but somewhere between 3-5 is probably best . If you stick to those numbers , a game will usually take around 30-45 minutes.This set CAN NOT be played as a standalone game but is rather a ( fantasy themed ) expansion to the original Munchkin core set ( although it is also compatible with any of the many Munchkin sets and expansions ) .Overall , the play is very fun , portable , fast-paced , and often amusing.This expansion adds a number of amusing cards to incorporate additional variations and twists on the game , and does a great job of breathing new life into a wonderful game . The addition of Dungeons -- a `` global '' card that effects all the characters and monsters in the game at the same time -- is one the more entertaining new features added thus far.Note that this particular expansion set , like its core game counterpart , is fantasy themed -- in other words , if the player does n't enjoy ( or wo n't understand ) Dungeons and Dragons and Lord of the Rings jokes , you are better off getting a different set of Munchkin cards ( Star Munchkin for sci-fi fans , Zombie Munchkin for zombie fans , etc ) .OVERALL SCORE : B	1
I originally wrote this review forMunchkin 6 Demented Dungeons . So , please excuse me if you read it twice ( but , I thought I 'd include it here as well since I did n't know where folks would start ) .This expansion , more than any other before or after it , rally adds a tone of variety and replayability to the game . 20 dungeons means you never quite know what 's going to happen next . Some dungeons add bad things ( -1 to run away , everyone changes sex , any curse that is drawn or played is applied to everyone , etc . ) , and others add good things ( increased hand size , extra treasure , everyone gets a class or race , etc. ) . The included Portal cards are a clever way to work this in the game ( you randomly insert the portal cards into the encounter deck , and whenever you flip one over you change dungeons ) . I bought Muchkin 1 , 2 , & 3 , and then jumped to this one , and found it worked out very well . I 've since bough all the Fantasy Munchkins , and a few other Munchkins as well . But , even if you have just the base game and/or a couple of your favorite Fantasy Munchkin expansions , you should really appreciate and be able to get the most out of what this adds to the game .	1
We have Lauri Tall Stacker Pegs , and these are similar , but I like them better for younger babies . Their bigger tops make it easier to stack for my 1.5-year-old daughter . She just likes stacking them and taking them apart , but my 3-year-old enjoys stacking them by color and making patterns . This is a very good set for that . I think the Lauri pegs are better for older children , so it really depends on the age of your kids .	1
I used to teach preschool and we always had this toy in the classrooms . I ordered these for my 2 year old twins and they are lots of fun . My daughter likes to group the colors and my son likes to make the tallest tower he can . Do n't be surprised if you get presented `` peg birthday cakes '' since this seems like a universal use for these . Simple toy that is lots of fun .	1
Our 2 year old has n't taken too much to these yet ( I still have hope ) . What I like about them is they are a good size for his hands , they stack great . You can use them to help learn counting and color recognition . The foam peg board works OK for the purpose . I was a little skeptical at first about the board .	1
My 22 month old twins LOVE this toy . They love to connect them and stick them in the wholes on the board . Yesterday while doing this toy with one of my daughters she connected only the same colors ! Purple on purple , blue on blue , etc . I was so proud ! Great toy , provides lots of fun for me and my twins . Oh , and they 're fine motor skills have really improved with this toy !	1
This toy came with no instructions . Do n't know whether to turn the textured side of the mat up or down . And comes in a plastic storage bag . That 's dangerous ! ! That said , the toy itself is fun for my 2 year old granddaughter . She immediately took the pegs and pushed them in the holes . We practice her colors and ask her to find a `` lellow '' `` bru '' or `` geen '' one , lol . Orange is a new color for her , so that was fun . This keeps her interest for a good while . We stack them all on a long pole and place it between furniture and she climbs under it . I plan to make her a cloth carryall for the pieces . I just do n't feel good about that plastic zipper bag .	1
She loves these and stacks towers that are taller than she is . Would recommend to young toddler through preschool ages	1
This was another toy my 15 month old daughters teacher had . My daughter seemed to love to play with and ten months later still does . You can do so much with these , they are great for any child and a definate must for children who need work developing their fine motor skills . My daughter has down syndrome and I think this is great . The only complaint it to try and pull them apart is very difficult , you actually have to twist them inside each other to try and loosen them up . But all in all it is a great toy .	1
Great peg/pegboard for the little ones . My two year old loves putting the pegs in/stacking them . It 's a great tool for fine motor skills . A+	1
My daughter really loves this PEG set . I would give 5 stars if there were n't a couple of problems . The yellow board the pegs fit into is foam . A harder more firm surface would be better ! I was disappointed by that . The pegs fit well into each slot and they are stackable but about 3 or 4 of them did not fit into the other pegs for stacking . I contacted amazon and they refunded me $ 5 for the inconvenience . They did give me the option to return for a new set but I choose to keep it as my daughter really likes playing with it . Despite the fact that the bottom is made of foam , I think it will last for play thru her toddler years ( she is 22months old now ) .	1
Love the easy grip pegs with wide head great for little hands to push . Love the bright colors as well as the ability to use in various ways ; stackable if you dont want to use the pad .	1
I was skeptical of the foam mat when I opened the package , but it actually works well . My twins were about 15 months when we first bought and to my surprise were able to get the concept of this toy , however would get frustrated and give up quickly . At 19 months they have this toy mastered . They have developed several ways to play with it from sorting colors , building towers , and even putting them on their fingers and pretending they are puppets . It sometimes keeps their attention for half an hour . A great addition to our toy collection !	1
This peg toy allows my 2 year old grandsons to use new skills . They have to work hard to master putting the peg into the mat . The mat needs to be thicker which would make it easier for them and also keep the mat from warping so that the mat will lie flat . Overall , it is a great toy that could be tweaked in this way to be even better ! I think they will play with this for several more years as they get better at stacking the pegs or creating designs . Great concept !	1
For the girlie-girl who loves imaginative play with fashion design , arts and crafts , etc . THIS is the toy for you ! There 's hours and hours of play here , producing all the fun little outfits that you can imagine you 'll be wearing yourself . And , like all great projects , creativity begets more creativity ... and the sky is the limit when you get into that `` zone . '' There 's no end to what your imagination can produce.Luckily , the Klutz company web site can provide you with more papers for these great projects ! Every girl I 've given this to has adored Paper Fashions .	1
We purchased this as a birthday present for an 8 year old fashionista . It comes with a bunch of mini hangers , all the cutouts , paper and tons of ideas and directions.Klutz does a great job of packaging some wonderful specialized collections for kids . We have a bunch of them . I like that this is transportable , easy to use and very appealing to look through.Nicely done and a great gift idea !	1
We bought this for our 10 year old granddaughter and she was delighted with the kit . It 's simple to use , everything is included and it gave hours of fashion fun for a young girl . These kits as a whole are very appealing to preteen girls .	1
We gave this to a 9 YO neighbor for Christmas . SHe loves it . Her & her friends spent hours playing with it . When I heard that they ran out of paper , I gave them some scrapbooking paper leftovers that I had . More hours of fun . Yesterday , she came over with some skinny paper dolls she had created to wear the dresses !	1
I bought this set for a 13 year old girl who is a friend of the family because she loves fashion . She spent the afternoon putting together a fashion line . The ribbons , sequins , beads , and `` fabrics '' ( paper ) come in such a large variety of lovely choices I could n't resist joining in . This would be an excellent gift for an older child in the hospital , travelling , or simply to pass a rainy weekend . There is so much paper included and choices with the stencils that this book provides a great deal of playtime .	1
I love it and my kid like it to it was a little hard to make the clothes but when you got a outfit made it fit the hangers it more of a older kids book like 13- up but i really enjoy helping her with this	1
How can you beat five adorable , high qulaity finger puppets for just over $ 16.00 ? ? ? These puppets are very detailed and wear the outfits that are depicted in the book by Eileen Christelow . Our daughter LOVES puppets and dramtic play brings tremendous educational value to our reading/story time . Or you can just sing the song with the puppets to act it out ! Any way you use these finger puppets they are sure to be a hit !	1
My girls have all the 5 Little monkey books , these are a great addition to our collection . Fit on your fingers nice and snug , and are very good quality !	1
My son loves to recite the No More Monkeys Jumping on the Bed story . When I bought him the book with all 5 stories I saw these to go along with it . They 're cute , and he does enjoy them but they 're a tad be awkward . They 're too big to really be finger puppets on an adult 's hand , let alone a 3 year old 's hand . They do velcro together so they can hold hands and you can make them jump . He was excited about them , but they are n't really a favorite of his . I probably would n't pay that much money for them again .	1
These are so adorable . I ordered them to go with the book . My grandson loves playing with these when I read him the book .	1
These are Great ! I bought these to entertain my kids on the plane ride and they were perfect . Little fingers fit well larger fingers ( female ) fit ok and really large finger ( Male ) Not well at all .	1
My daughter was a reluctant reader until we hooked up with the Fly Guy series.This is an amazing series that motivated my dyslexic tot to forage on and read ahead.Fly Guy became an instant favorite . We now own every book in the series . She planson keeping the books to share with her children when she gets older so ... the purchaseof the stuffed pal was a perfect stocking stuffer for her . The body is soft and thewings are made of a crinkly fabric . This is a must have for an Fly Guy fan . At $ 8 the purchase wasa no-brainer . The only issue I had was delivery . For some reason I had to order this 3x . UPS or FEDEX , not sure which one , kept telling Amazon that my address did n't exist . Eventually , the product arrivedand we were thrilled . You could almost say that our stuffed pal had a Fly Guy adventure of his very own .	1
I wanted a small suffed toy to go along with the book . This is n't too big ( a little larger than the palm of my hand ) and it is n't & # 34 ; too girly & # 34 ; . I wanted this for my 5 year old son who is just starting to read . He loves the Fly Guy series and this is perfect to go with it .	1
My granddaughter loves the book series so we surprised her with this Fly Guy doll for her birthday . She absolutely loved it and has been having a wonderful time playing with it . A very fun idea !	1
Perfect for those kids that are Fly Guy fans . He is a nice size to hold on to while reading .	1
My 6-year-old son adores Fly Guy and is pleased that he can read these books by himself . This doll is a unique and fun toy that he really liked . It was worthwhile for the price .	1
My son loves these books and when I saw the doll I had to get it . It 's a great size , I can probably cram it into his Xmas stocking . It seems well made and looks exactly like the pictures in the book .	1
My daughter loves Pete the cat and stuffed animals . This is the best of both worlds . She loves reading his books and singing his songs along with him .	1
We love Pete the Cat ! My 2 and 4 yr old enjoy playing with him as they listen to his cds and read the book . Well made and the size is perfect . Not too big , not too small .	1
I ordered Pete and also the second book for a birthday gift . He is so funny looking . I am sure my grandbaby will get lots of fun time with Pete . I also plan on ordering the next two books coming out later in the year .	1
My 7 year old has been in to Pete the Cat books this year . This was a HUGE hit ! Its just a plus doll , but he loves to have it with him when he reads Pete the Cat books and at bed time . Just a cute cuddly cat !	1
My grand daughter was introduced to Pete the Cat in preschool . We bought her many of the books and got her & # 34 ; Pete & # 34 ; for Christmas . She LOVES him - he has a place of honor on her bed . She calls him & # 34 ; Cat the Pete & # 34 ; . He very cute and seems well made .	1
Pete the Cat is an Atlanta original and the work of artist James Dean.Mr . Eric ( Eric Litwin ) brought Pete to children with his absolutely enchanting bookPete the Cat : I Love My White Shoes.A slow and local word of mouth phenomenon was born with booksellers , teachers , parents and librarians who witnessed the amazing way Pete connects with young children first hand . From there , he 's just grown.If you support the intersection of early reading with art and music , then you ca n't miss by getting the whole series ( there are two currently , and a third coming out in May 2013 ) and this very charming Pete doll to go along with them.This Pete doll is a sturdily constructed felted fleece doll with cotton shoes and sweet , soft , nylon whiskers . On one foot he wears a red shoe , on the other a red shoe ( both with laces that have been screen printed on ) , and a felted fleece heart appliqued to his chest . He has a stitched smile , nose and brows , and his eyes were made of appliques that are stitched over.He has a flat bottom that is well weighted to sit upright , and a curly tail that is delightful.He has held up well to the abuse that my twin 3 years olds ( a girl and a boy ) each heap on their own individual Pete . One Pete proved not to be enough . Now they each have their own Pete to love , and love they do.This Pete doll has no parts that come loose , so he is a perfectly appropriate doll for any age .	1
Pete is pretty cute . He is not as soft and cuddly as I had expected based on some other reviews though . My kids adore the Pete the Cat books , so this will be a treat .	1
My son will love this . It is going in his stocking . He loves both of the Pete the Cat books , and I am looking forward to the new release . A bit smaller than I pictured it , but it will do .	1
Pete the Cat is great ! He is the perfect pal for a child and sleeps with my grandson every night . He looks just like Pete in the book series , too . Love Pete !	1
The toy was real nice . I felt it was a bit over priced . My grandson loves the book and the toy .	1
This is absolutely adorable ! ! How often do you find a stuffed excavator ? ! Not to mention -- a stuffed excavator from your child 's favorite book ? ! This is utterly adorable , and truly loved ! !	1
Our Goodnight Goodnight Construction site obsessed toddler loves this little guy . It 's a good size for a 2 year to cart around . The main body is soft and the boom and tracks are a nylonish material . It seems sturdy .	1
He got the book a year ago and loves it so much . We got this and the lacing cards . They are both made very well and easy to love .	1
What a cute Track Hoe ! ... .and my little fellah , who is 2.5 yrs , LOVE this ! ! ! ! He leaves it in his bed and holds it while we read him tractor books ... .. !	1
Well ... comfortably . If you have ( or are ) a little digger fanatic , this is a gem . Of course , the associated book ( Goodnight , Goodnight , Construction Site ) is great as well ... but with or without it , this is a great pleasure and a great savior for parents whose little ones want to take their diggers to bed . It is nicely made , and has the side benefit of being more manipulable for 2-ish-year-olds to pick up small objects than a & # 34 ; hard & # 34 ; digger . I hope they soon bring out the doze and cement truck soon !	1
This is a lovely book . Each page adds a new ribbon to the pretty rainbow that is forming as you go through the book . I was fascinated by the way the ribbons were added . Very ingenious.The colors are gorgeous and the story is cute . The drawings are charming . I find the book to be sturdy as well . I would certainly add this to my must have list of books for children . What a nice way to learn and review colors .	1
Bought this book as a Easter gift for my grand-daughter . She loves it , she is a begining reader . Very nice book thanks . birdladypoole	1
What a cool idea ! My daughter loves this book . The colours are vibrant and the story is cute . Although I too did have an issue with it straying from the ROYGBIV order , I can see how difficult it would be to find two creatures to portray two purple colours . Not sure if there is such a thing as a purple butterfly ? !	1
This book completely fascinates my daugthers ( 4 and almost 3 ) . They think it 's wonderful that has you turn the page another bright coloured ribbon appears - and as you go through the book a rainbow is made.It 's a really lovely story about a rabbit and rainbow and a lovely way to learn colours.I think it 's a wonderful book to give as a gift and one that will be enjoyed for many years .	1
This is a staple book in my household . It 's a sturdy board-book , with colorful ribbons for each page ending with a pop-up rainbow . The only drawback is that the colors are slightly different instead of the roygbiv colors I had originally learned , and the text does n't `` pop '' it 's curly black text ( not cursive ) . But I love it none-the-less !	1
I love popup books and interactive children 's books , and have to admit : this is one of my favorites . It 's not complex/intricate , but it has a very cute storyline which combines colors , animals , and an interactive ribbon . If kids could make their own books , I think this is the kind they would make . Brilliantly done ! I love how each page reveals a new color being added to the rainbow , and that when you turn the last page it `` reloads '' the book so it 's ready to read again .	1
This is a very different kind of book , quite innovative in it 's use of ribbons to creat a `` rainbow '' page by page as you read the charming little story to your youngster . The bright graphics and lovely colored ribbons make for an eye-popping experience as little ones revel in the pretty colors and see how the rainbow develops one color on top of the next . By the end of the story you magically have a glorious rainbow and your child will want to read it again and again !	1
This is a great teaching tool for helping your young one to learn their colors . Real satin-like ribbons appear as you turn each board-book page . First just one , then a second color on the next page , etc . Finally there is a complete rainbow of colors . The kids can touch the ribbons ; it is a nice tactile to reinforce colors .	1
This sweet story acquaints the reader with color , by means of an adorable `` Little Rabbit '' who hops through the forest questing his friends on how a rainbow is made . `` Ladybug , what makes a rainbow ? '' asked Little Rabbit . `` RED said Ladybug , gently closing her RED wings . You need RED to make a rainbow , '' and a RED ribbon is displayed . Instantly engaging , each two-page spread of this book exposes a different colored satin ribbon to represent the colors of a rainbow , and in the end , a multihued pop-up rainbow is revealed ! Vividly illustrated , the pastel renderings leap off the page , while the endearing images , and `` magical '' ribbons charm `` little ones '' as they learn.In spite of the instructional values , this book is inaccurate ! The author does not depict the colors of a rainbow properly ? In 1672 Sir Isaac Newton , who was largely responsible for clarifying the origin of color , discovered that by passing sunlight through a prism created a rainbow of color , resulting in a color order : red , orange , yellow , green , blue , INDIGO , violet or purple = ROYGBIV . `` What Makes a Rainbow ? '' omits INDIGO . Why ? Betty Ann Schwartz had the perfect opportunity to educate children about color theory by portraying the spectrum in its correct form . This book is SO distinctively unique from other Pop-Up Books that I hesitate in giving it ONLY four stars , but I ca n't help but wonder , `` why do it wrong ? '' I understand this is ONLY a children 's book , but I love it so , I want it to be RIGHT ! As an artist , I hunt for imaginative , and educational children 's books , and `` What Makes a Rainbow ? '' is interesting , and innovative , and , despite the error , it is an exceptional book - children adore it !	1
I have purchased this book again and again to give as gifts . It is really a unique book where each page that is turned displays a different colored ribbon . This book will always be a favorite . Even the big kids ( who have read it a milllion times ) can not resist running their fingers along the smooth ribbons .	1
WHAT MAKES A RAINBOW ? is a winner because it 's clever , well-made , colorful , educational , beautifully illustrated and sturdy . ( No , a child ca n't rip out the ribbons ; however , do n't give them any scissors ! Ha . ) Little Rabbit asks his mother , `` What makes a rainbow ? '' and she tells him to ask his friends . He proceeds to ask : Ladybug/Red , Mr. Fox/Orange , Little Chick/Yellow , Mr. Grasshopper/Green , Bluebird/Blue , and Butterfly/Purple . ( Where are the MRS. ? Hmm . ) Every page is predominantly one color and with each turn of the page , a shiny ribbon appears , each under the previous -- an inventive idea ! Love it.At the end , Little Rabbit 's mother reappears and says , `` Now you know what makes a rainbow : RAIN , COLORS -- red , orange , yellow , green , blue , purple and SUNSHINE ! '' I like the way she suggested he ask others ; this shows parents that sometimes it is best to allow your child to answer his/her *own* questions instead of telling them the answers -- Stimulate their Imagination and Inquisitiveness ! We can learn SO MUCH from others . I love the way this concept shines throughout the story . Great job all around Schwarz , Turner and Gondek -- now THIS is Teamwork ! My daughter picked this out at [ local store ] among many wonderful books . She would n't let it go , she just HAD to have it . She has only done this twice ; once with a stuffed kitty and the other -- this book ! WHAT MAKES A RAINBOW ? would make a great gift ! 8/10 stars ... .	1
This book has always been a favorite in our household with our two daughters ( now ages 3 and 6 ) . They both grew up with this book and it made for a great introduction to numbers and counting . The book consists of little plastic monkey faces showing through holes in each page . As you turn each page , one face stays back on the previous page so that the count of monkeys goes down . The story flows with the decrease in monkey faces as they monkeys do something silly that they are n't supposed to do and fall off the bed ... until there are none left . My 3 year old still chooses this book pretty regularly for her bedtime story even though she already knows her counting . She thinks it 's a funny story and we regularly tell them to `` stop messing around on the beds so they do n't fall off and bump their heads . '' It is a great introduction to counting for your little ones . Highly Recommended !	1
My daughter , ( who is now 8 years old ) , received this as a christmas gift when she was 2 . It has been ready many times , and since been passed along to my son who is now 4 . My children enjoy the tactile quality of the monkeys faces . It is helpful learning counting when there is something they can feel . I have always enjoyed reading the sing song story . It does n't take long to read , and after all these years I pretty much have it memorized . A great book , very fun .	1
My 14 month old son absolutely loves this book . My wife and I read it to him multiple times a day . He loves touching the monkey heads and the repetition . He book seeks out the book and has a motion to indicate that he wants this specific book !	1
My 1 year old son received this from his grandmother . He loved the song already so he loves reading this book . He enjoys touching all the monkey faces which are plastic . It is a cute little book with very bright illustrations . Repetition is good for little ones so we thoroughly like this book .	1
We got this for our son 's first Halloween in lieu of candy since he was only 10-months . It is cute , tactile , and made for a sweet story time on Halloween night and many nights thereafter . It is just about Monsters , not Halloween , so it is appropriate for anytime and certainly gender neutral .	1
Just to echo all the other reviews ... this is an amazing purchase . I got it on sale , but I would pretty much pay any price to replace it if i needed to . My daughter is 15-months old and has been obsessed with this book wince we bought it about two months ago . We read it every night at least once . I 'm not sure why Amazon calls the age range & # 34 ; 2 and up. & # 34 ; I imagine we 'll be done with it by that age .	1
We have 3 kids , and a ton of kids books , and this is definitely one of our favorites ! It 's especially great for the younger children ( under 2 ? ) . It combines touch & feel with peek a boo , how can you lose ? The text reads well , good rhythm and rhyme , and the monsters are cute and fun . I 'll definitely be giving this as a baby gift !	1
We got this book for my son when he was 6 months old . He was absolutely fascinated with the red hair on the cover monster and with the sparkly texture on one of the other monsters.He is 9 month now and loves the surprise of the monsters under the flaps . It been a great book that keeps his attention while I read it to him ! The pictures are cute and colorful and as an adult I find that it is fun to read this book to him .	1
This is THE favorite book at my house . Both my 4 year old , and my 2 year old still beg for it every night . It is by far the most-read book in our house . I highly recommend it !	1
This is a very cute book and my one year old grandson likes it but it could use a little more touch and feel surfaces .	1
I made up a little song to go with this book and my son LOVES it . The furry/spotted/rough/soft monsters hiding around the house never cease to amuse .	1
My son LOVES this book . It 's our fave . I should 've bought two as he likes it so much . Would recommend to a friend .	1
My one-year-old grandson loves tactile books with different surfaces to feel , so I was excited to find this book on Amazon . He loves sitting on my lap and rubbing his feet on the board book , which makes him giggle !	1
My son loved the little hands love book so when I saw this one I just had to get it . One of my sons favorite touch and feel books .	1
What can I say that other parents and grandparents have n't already said in their reviews ? This is a fantastic book ... Since it is fall/early winter now , my daughter 's tooties are covered up so we use our hands . She loves this book . She even starts to feel the grass on the front cover before we even get to the pages . Yes , it is a short book but at bed time we do a mixture of longer books ( Goodnight Moon-type ) and shorter books like this one ... so for us the length is perfect ! We 've had this since she was 4 months old and she is now 15 months . Very sturdy , high quality . I will be buying one for my twin nieces for Christmas . I 'm also buying Little Hands Love . I 'd picked up `` Feet '' on an Xmas shopping whim , I never thought that there were other books by the same people until today !	1
My daughter LOVES paging through this book and feeling all of the different textures ! It had held up wonderfully , and she looks at it often !	1
The variety of textures and colors in this book captured my nieces interst immediately and consistently . I ca n't tell you how many times she has brought this book to us to be read to her	1
This book is my 6 month old 's favorite touch and feel book . Each page shows a picture of baby feet touching some kind of textured surface on the left side and then a huge touch and feel piece of that material on the right . I have never seen a touch and feel book with such large areas to touch . It is really wonderful ! Also , the textures on each page a pretty different in feel and color so each page really feels like a new texture . My only complaint is that the book is not longer ! We are always sad when it is over !	1
This is one of my grandson 's favorite books . He goes to it over and over again . & # 34 ; Do it again & # 34 ; he 'll say .	1
I found this book at the store when my son was about a year old , and now , 6 months later , he still brings me this book to read to him all the time . The book has held up very well to his not so gentle style of playing with his books . In all , there are six textures for his hands ( or feet ) to touch : towel , sand , grass , rug , leaves , and blanket . Each texture is very large , at least a 3 '' x3 '' patch for all of them . The photographs that go along with each texture are also beautiful . The text is very simple and uses great descriptive words ... `` Little feet love..fresh , green , grass . `` After purchasing this book and discovering my son 's love of it , I ordered `` Little Hands Love '' . It is also a great book , but I think the `` Little Feet Love '' book is slightly nicer . I would love to see more books in this collection because I 'm sure they would be a hit .	1
Not only did my nephew enjoy receiving this for his first birthday , his older sisters , ages 2 and 4 , also loved it . While you can gently help baby feel the images with feet , you can also use hands . Babies enjoy a wide variety of sensory stimuli , and I think this book is a charming addition to any family 's touch and feel collection .	1
My son has liked this book since before he was one . Now , he really loves it . He 's always bringing it to me and asking me to feel the things in the book . The other book called 'Little Hands Love ' is great too !	1
This book is nice because the touch areas are very large , much larger than most touch books on the market . Two things I do n't like ... I wish it was longer and had more to touch . It is about the same length as most touch books out there , though . My one real complaint is the page with sand . It talks about the sand being silky on your feet , but the touch part is sandpaper ! How is THAT silky in any way ? ! I wish they would have put something else on that page instead . Overall , it 's cute and my 11 month old likes it , which is the most important thing .	1
I like how big the touch and feel sections are in this book . If you have very many of these books , however , they can get repetitive . This one has towels , sand , grass , blankets , and leaves . We have used our toddlers feet on the touch and feel sections , and she remembers and enjoys doing that with this book .	1
We 've become board-book experts ( snobs ? ! ) over the last ten months . This is by far one of the nicer `` touch and feel '' varities out there . The feeley spots are large and visible for young babies and there is a nice variety of textures : terry cloth towel , sand paper , faux grass , deep shaggy fleece , silk leaves that crinkle , short fuzzy fleece . The pages are stiff ad sturdy , the spine/binding is well made . Colors are bright and photos are pretty . Our 10-month-old daughter loves this book ! ( ... Now , if only it had `` lift and look '' flaps too , it would be perfect ! )	1
This is a bigger sized board book and it has patches on each page of different textures that baby can rub her toes on ! I love the concept and I am happy with this purchase .	1
I got this book for one of the kids I babysit . We do this among many others to get her ready for kindergarden next year . The book flows nicely and really helps them get ready . If you have a child prepping for school I would buy these books and get them ready . It is also fun for them to do at the same time as learning new things .	1
I 'm a mother , trainer , and in-home childcare provider , so I am careful about the educational books I buy for kids because I want to challenge and prepare them for school and life success . I bought this simply because the price was so low and I thought it would be fun for our kids to have another `` homework '' book to do . I was impressed by the coverage of important math concepts and the way with which they 're presented ; the price is great , too . For $ 2 , it 's worth it.For all of my kids , I purchase the Comprehensive Curriculum for Preschool ( or Kindergarten , 1st grade , etc. , depending on their age ) . It 's only $ 13 and is almost 600 pages of awesome activities that really prepare your child for the next level . I recommend that for the main curriculum and this as a fun activity for your own kids or your childcare 's Writing Center .	1
My 4 yr old son absolutely loves this book and finds it like an enjoyable game doing the assignments on each page . The instructions are simple and easy for my son to understand and read . I am really impressed with this book and I 'm confident this book and others will get him obviously ahead in school .	1
I 've found School Zone workbooks to be useful in introducing various subjects , and to review what my child already knows.After completingTransition Math K-1 , my son breezed through this workbook . Most of the pages contain counting exercises for numbers 0-12 ( they had a great way of explaining zero to little kids ! ) , and shape/pattern recognition . The intro to addition and subtraction used pictures to describe the concept.There was one page about clocks , and a few pages about sequencing and greater/less . At the end of the workbook is a review section of everything that was taught , along with an answer key , and a cute certificate.The School Zone workbook we are currently using isTime , Money and Fractions .	1
The mechanic of seeing through the cards to the cards below is cool to see in action , saves space on the game board , and causes you to have to think in a different way than usual . The game can be played without role-playing it but some people may find it entertaining ( to themselves , if not others ) to develop little mini-stories . Even without adding your own role-playing , just reading the stuff written on the cards can be entertaining ( at least until you 've seen all the cards multiple times ) . And who does n't want to play a game where they mercilessly torture and slaughter their own family ? *grin*	1
Played a 3 player game and everyone had a lot of fun . The best part of this game is creating the story about how things happen to the families .	1
Gloom is a wonderful card game with the unique ( and clever ) mechanic of using transparent plastic cards that `` stack '' upon each other as the game progresses . Game play is relatively straightforward : ( 1 ) play cards that subtract points on your own `` family '' members or that add points to other `` families '' , ( 2 ) `` kill '' family members ( yours or others ) , ( 3 ) attempt to accumulate the lowest score.Each card contains its own set of rules that affect game play , so each card contains ( often substantial ) text.The game is fairly flexible in terms of the number of players it can accommodate , but somewhere between 3-5 is probably best . If you stick to those numbers , a game will usually take around 30-45 minutes.This game can be played as a standalone set and is also compatible with any of the various Gloom expansions , so a player may consistently add new cards to the deck in order to breathe new life ( no pun intended ) into the game.Overall , the play is very fun , portable , fast-paced , and often amusing . As you may have surmised by the initial synopsis , the humor is dark and morbid ( albeit very tongue-in-cheek ) . If that is n't your cup of tea , this game wo n't entertain you . The art is suited perfectly to the theme.APPROPRIATE AUDIENCE : Hardcore gamers will enjoy this as a `` warm-up '' between their more complicated gaming sessions . It 's a useful tool for introducing newcomers to these kinds of games ( although Fluxx or Current Number of the Beast are maybe even better for this purpose ) .OVERALL SCORE : B+ Light-hearted , relatively fast-paced , and with solid replay value . Strategy is fairly one-dimensional , but there are enough variations of cards that every gaming experience is entertaining ) .	1
This game takes a little getting use to , but it 's been fun the few times we 've played . I think if we get into the 'story telling ' it will make it even more fun .	1
`` Gloom '' is one of those card games that people will either immediately love or hate , but fortunately it will be fairly easy to predict into which category most folks will fall . Those that will love this game are the natural story tellers who like interactive games . The folks that will hate it are the more serious players who like quick games with ridged rules and little talking ( Like my mother ) .Game Play : These very cool cards are mostly transparent and `` events '' are played on top of each other , with only the visible values and actions counting . Unlike most games , the goal is to make your characters as miserable as possible ( and to die in that sad state ) , while spreading joy and good fortune to your opponents ( and perhaps killing them off in that happy state ) . There are card with negative effects ( bad events ) that you will want to play on your own character cards , cards with positive effects that you will want to play on your opponents , cards that will kill a character ( use strategy to determine if you will use this on your own or an opponent 's character ) , and several different types of special cards that modify the game play . Ultimately , the winner will be player with the characters that lived ( and died ) with the most misery . However , the best part comes not from the mechanics of the game but rather from the story telling that goes along with the adding of the misfortunate\fortunate events as these are largely left up to the players to embellish using the brief description on the cards . I was amazed at the clever and involved story lines that developed during our games.This is a very fun and interactive game that does require strategy and some luck to win and also encourages creative storytelling to enhance the experience . There are also expansion packs that add extra event cards and allow for additional players . We used theGloom : Unfortunate Expeditionsas well.Highly Recommended !	1
Great game to play ! Play with friends who are creative and storytellers , cuz it 'll make the game much funner . Great concept but you need to buy expansion packs for include more players .	1
Game was recommended to me by a coworker . Love the player-reliant story-telling that keeps everyone in the game . Cards are much sturdier than expected and considering expansions to allow for more players- more chaos .	1
This game is awesome . It has a funny smell though because of the cards . : ) Love it all around though !	1
I first saw this game on the Geek & Sundry YouTube Channel , on Wil Wheaton 's show , Tabletop . It was hilarious watching them with their creative fun , so I had to buy it . It is just as hilarious when you 're playing it yourself . This is a storytelling game and works really well for people that are creative . Just hearing the different stories that everyone comes up with is funny in itself !	1
I purchased this game for my 19 year old son . He almost bought it himself a few weeks ago , so I know I made the right choice .	1
Like most parents I was a bit surprised to be paying so much for a card game , but now that we have played I realized it was well worth the investment . In this game the ultimate goal is to kill off your family while gaining the most negative points possible . This game is no darker then Clue , if your okay with that game then you should be okay with this one.You could call this game a Story Building Strategy Game , for the fact with each card you play your story changes as does the outcome of your family members . It 's different , and not for everyone I am sure , but it gets your kids creative skills going . You also learn several words that you get to explain to your kids and phrases.There are no guns , knives ect.. in this game , but instead plagues , consumption and more . When I think on it the deaths , are more geared towards issues from the 1800 's . I agree with the age rating on the game 13 and up , I do not recommend it for anyone younger . The cards themselves are beautiful I have never seen anything quite like it .	1
This is a really fun game . I love playing it with my brother because he is really bad at math and loves to tell stories . I like how it 's different from other games . But tons of fun .	1
You will have hours of fun with this game as you try to simultaneously make your family more miserable as you increase the happiness of other players'families . With characters like red-headed stepchild , what 's not to love ? Plus , the cards are made of a durable plastic , so no matter how much you play , they do not become worn . Overall , a very fun toy for adolescents and adults . The directions may be too complex for children .	1
hilarious text , fun game play , good card game all around . only issue is that youneed to buy expansions if you want more players . you get more cards with it that change the game play as well , which is both good and bad . just eh on the xpacs	1
This game is simple and twisted . After all who would deliberately try to make the people under their care miserable , but that 's the goal here.As others have posted and the game eve points out the premise is simple . You start with 5 members of a family and the goal is to have them die miserable and alone . You can do that by having them & # 34 ; Pursued by Poodles & # 34 ; or a host of other funny but twisted happenings until you finally play an & # 34 ; Untimely Death & # 34 ; and end their misery . The player who manages to have his family die the most miserable , wins.the mechanics are simple . The cards are see through , with scoring cards having up to three circles containing a value on the left side of the card . Cards are played by placing them over the poor unfortunate soul being afflicted or occasionally blessed ( giving a positive score to an opposing players family member . When there are no living members of any family , the visible scoring circles are added up to determine the victor.Its simple and fun , but you do need people who like to tell tales and will actually read the card titles . If you play with someone who is n't into that , the game can be a bit less fun .	1
I gave this game to my daughter 's family for Christmas , and they took it with them on their vacation and said they love it .	1
This game is so much fun and no matter how many times you play it it never gets old . As long as you enjoy story telling and fabricating crazy tales , this is a must have game !	1
Someone called this a mix of Edward Gorey meets Addams Family and that 's dead on for the presentation and art work . It 's a fun card game with not only a fantastically beautiful look and feel , but also a clever use of transparent cards and a great sense of humor on the cards ... leaving room for you and your friends to add your own darkly amusing plot points . Tons of fun , original , and great replay value as a card game .	1
I found this to be a quiet , simple game . I have nothing bad to say about it , but it is the type of game that if you like a stealing & trumping card game ... this is for you . The morbid theme gives it a spooky twist . I did n't find it a great party/ social game though . For that I would recommend `` No Thanks '' .	1
Gloom is a fun and goofy way to ... well , kill you family . Every game has been a ton of fun and it 's a good way to teach new words to younger players . It 's also a great way to get people out of their comfort zones and creating stories on the fly . Easy 5 stars and highly recommended .	1
The game 's mechanics compliment its morbidity . Killing off people 's family members is fun and the plastic transparent cards are visually interesting .	1
A real game of make believe , just the ideas that come up to play the game are creative . People have a blast making up the backgrounds and truths of each family . I does need a bit more time to play but well worth it .	1
Gloom is a great game night addition for anyone . The stories you can tell with this game are not only hilarious but often gruesome depending on the players . This is an easy game to play the directions are very simple . Being that it 's just cards you can easily take this anywhere . Nothing is more fun than making your family miserable and sending them to their demise in unique ways each time . The affordability of this card game makes it another great way to start off a game night !	1
I have always loved the feel of plastic cards like these . I have played another game that uses stacking plastic cards over each other ( some Cranium game I do n't remember the name of ) , but this one is a bit different . The artwork is cute . But , for some reason , I do not really get into the storytelling aspect of this game . I feel like the gameplay is just so-so . I feel like it is really easy for a person to get really ahead quickly . I never am really excited to play a game of Gloom with my friends , but it can be fun from time to time . I like that the games can be over fairly quickly ( within 1 hour ) .	1
In our home we 're big fans of Fluxx and Cards Against Humanity . I 'm always looking for new games . This game was a suggested product and after reading all the great reviews I decided to give it a try . We loved it ! The first game was a 2 player game and immediately after I wanted to play again . We played a second time with a third player and just loved it . I 'm going to be ordering the expansions as soon as possible .	1
The cool part about this game are the see thru cards . It 's a story telling game . You do n't have to do story telling but it makes it more fun . I saw Will Wheaton play it on youtube . I have bought 2 other expansions . You basically are trying to kill off your family but your opponents do n't want you to die first so they play cards to keep you happy . Easy to play . If you are not offended about death subjects it 's a great game . It 's kind of like the Addams Family meet the Munsters in a card game .	1

In addition to a new family , it adds a new `` home '' mechanic that features a place of residence for each family ( including families from the main Gloom set and the Unwelcome Guests expansion . This new feature is a lot of fun , and provides a welcome twist to the existing rules.Overall , the play is very fun , portable , fast-paced , and often amusing .

The new cards add great variation to the existing base set .	1
Gloom is an amazing game . Very good for a intellectual activity with that certain special nerdy girl you may like . Great also for groups of gamers for a nice relaxing party atmosphere card game . It requires a bit of imagination to really appreciate it . If you have a brain and a quirky sense of humor and you like games . Get Gloom !	1
Love this game . So different than more other board games . Great way to include more players through addition of expansions .	1
i love this game . it is so much fun . im all about new and different games . i love to play this with my brother because he is very bad at keeping score so i win most of the time . lol . and he loves to tell each characters story and to tell why each person got what fate . its a must buy if you want a fun and fast card game .	1
I love this game ! It 's a ton of fun and always brings out the ( friendly ) competitive sides between my husband and I . It 's easy to learn , funny , and there are lots of expansion packs if you like the game . Great for couples game night !	1

This game takes a few rounds of play to get use to . We have n't gotten into the & # 34 ; story telling & # 34 ; yet . I think that will help . It 's a lot of fun , and very different to say the least . I bought this because it was recommended if you wanted to have 4 or more players .	1
This expansion deck for the coreGloomcard game allows you to add an additional player , as it has a new `` family '' , and includes several new event and action cards to bring new twists into the game play . The new deck also adds an additional level of complexity to the game that can significantly increases the required playing time.Since this is an expansion deck , you must already have the original game for these cards to be used and , depending on how much time we have , we sometimes take out the `` special '' cards from this deck and play using the original rules.This is a great way to expand the number of players and to bring new life ( no pun intended ) to your Gloom game ! Highly Recommended ! CFH	1
This expansion is really enjoyable . It adds another family so that you can add another player but it also adds another element to the game . It plays like a universal rule that affects everyone playing and gives everyone special abilities for a short time . The rule changes several times during the game but is n't too distracting from the play of the game . I highly recommend it . If you like Gloom you wo n't be disappointed in this expansion .	1
I 'd recommend Unwelcome Guests before Unfortunate Expeditions but UE is still a great expansion . It adds another layer to the game mechanic with an ongoing Expedition that will change how everyone dooms their family . I just wish they 'd put a little marker somewhere on the face of the card so you know it belongs to a certain expansion to make it easier to separate out the cards when you do n't want to play with the expansion mixed in with your base deck .	1
I bought this game randomly because it has Cthulhu , and I 'll buy anything Cthulhu ... This game is a hoot when you `` screw your neighbor '' and seeing the look on their face . I found the instructions a little difficult to understand , so I looked on youtube and saw the game in motion . The game is fairly simple and with an experienced player , it is easy to teach others . Very fun game !	1
Gloom , in general , is a wonderful card game with the unique ( and clever ) mechanic of using transparent plastic cards that `` stack '' upon each other as the game progresses . Game play is relatively straightforward : ( 1 ) play cards that subtract points on your own `` family '' members or that add points to other `` families '' , ( 2 ) `` kill '' family members ( yours or others ) , ( 3 ) attempt to accumulate the lowest score.Cthulhu Gloom puts a fresh new coat on the base game , placing it squarely in the Lovecraftian/Cthulhu mythos.Each card contains its own set of rules that affect game play , so each card contains ( often substantial ) text.The game is fairly flexible in terms of the number of players it can accommodate , but somewhere between 3-5 is probably best . If you stick to those numbers , a game will usually take around 30-45 minutes.This game can be played as a standalone set and is also compatible with any of the various Gloom expansions ( and the base set ) , so a player may consistently add new cards to the deck in order to breathe new life ( no pun intended ) into the game . Having said that , the Unhappy Homes expansion pack does NOT include new residences for the families contained in the Cthulhu Gloom box.Overall , the play is very fun , portable , fast-paced , and often amusing . As you may have surmised by the initial synopsis , the humor is dark and morbid ( albeit very tongue-in-cheek ) and very Cthulhu-centric . If that is n't your cup of tea , this game wo n't entertain you . The art is suited perfectly to the theme.APPROPRIATE AUDIENCE : Hardcore gamers will enjoy this as a `` warm-up '' between their more complicated gaming sessions . It 's a useful tool for introducing newcomers to these kinds of games ( although Fluxx or Current Number of the Beast are maybe even better for this purpose ) .OVERALL SCORE : A- Light-hearted , relatively fast-paced , and with solid replay value . Strategy is fairly one-dimensional , but there are enough variations of cards that every gaming experience is entertaining ) . It 's also a real treat for Lovecraft fans , as almost all of the short stories are represented here .	1
Can I play this game with different types of people ? Is it easy to teach/learn ? Gloom is not a hard game to pick up and play , but it has a lot of shifting elements to keep track of , so it becomes quite intricate . I believe this poses as much or as little a problem as you choose to make of it . Some players are going to be better at keeping track of the layers of effects , both cancelled and persistent under stacks of cards . Others are going to feel like they are constantly losing track of what 's going on , even within their own family . My feeling is : live in the moment , build a story , toy with your opponents , and if a few things slip through the cracks , so much the better . It is the world of H.P . Lovecraft , after all . Some chaos , deception , and mislaid fragments are only fitting.Sometimes it 's confusing what the card wants you to do . It 's best to have a relaxed attitude about this , too . The longer you play , the less confused you will feel . But in the beginning , do n't get too hung up on playing flawlessly.Do you have to have to know who H.P . Lovecraft is to play this game ? No . Here 's how it is . If you do n't know anything about H.P . Lovecraft , not only will you not get the jokes , but some words will be complete gobbledegook . For instance , say you played the card & # 34 ; Said 'Hastur ' Thrice & # 34 ; or & # 34 ; Matriculated at Miskatonic. & # 34 ; What story would you make up about Hastur or Miskatonic , if you had no idea of their Lovecraftian significance ? Well , all kinds of things , really . If you have a high enough vocabulary to make some logical inferences* , the stories you come up with are going to be even more amusing than those of the H.P . Lovecraft fans , who might feel enslaved by a duty to be 'correct . ' If your knowledge of Lovecraft lore is very good , every card will make you grin , and it will be easier to invent stories than when playing regular Gloom , because you get to build upon a framework of stories that already exists . And the completely inappropriate improvised yarns of the non-Lovecraftian gamers , will make you giggle even more . So , it 's actually quite a lot of fun to play with a mix of people . Which , is presumably the way everyone plays , as I 'm sure the percentage of the population who only hangs out with others who worship Cthulhu is pretty rare . *If you do n't have sufficient vocabulary to infer or invent an appropriate meaning for the gobbledegook words , you will end up making up some pretty silly sounding story contributions . But you 're still going to be able to master gameplay , so it will be fine.Will boring people tolerate this super fun game ? Yes . You will be surprised by the creative sides of your non-heavy-gamer friends . There 's something about this game that makes people feel like they are on a fun adventure , loosening them up and inspiring them to be experimental . It 's a deck of cards , versus a complicated board , and there are so many intriguing words and cunning drawings , you just ca n't help but want to be a good sport . Maybe give them a beer , if necessary .	1
I bought this on a whim to play with my D & D ; friends when we do n't have enough players for our regular game . It is enjoyable and novel as a result of the clear card format . The art is interesting and the flavor text on teh cards is great . I recommend.The loss of the fifth star is largely the result of the cost and the quality of the cards . My set is a little bit cloudy and they have gotten moderately less clear with minimal use.I also bought the expansion and made identical comments there as well .	1
I saw the original Gloom being played on TableTop . When I discovered Cthulhu Gloom I just had to get it . Great fun and gets shy people to break out of their shell .	1
After playing Gloom , I thought to myself , you know what I need , this game . Then I heard that there was a Cthulhu skin of the game , and I changed my statement to say , & # 34 ; I need THAT game ! & # 34 ; In Cthulhu Gloom , just as in Gloom , players have a family . Their goal is to kill off their family while they are in the worst possible condition . They do this by playing negative pathos cards on them.Players draw 5 cards . Players play two cards on their turn . Players can only play unfortunate death ( not including action cards , or card effects ) on a family member during their first play of their turn.Players can play any card on any family member , including other player 's family members . Cards have effects that are instant ( effects the person who played the card ) , constant ( effects the person who the card was played on , as long as it is visible ) , of continuous ( like constant , but as long as the continuous logo is visible , it is in effect ) .Once a players entire family is dead , the game is over and all player 's add up their families pathos score . The player with the lowest pathos score is the winner.WHAT DID I LIKE ABOUT THE GAME : When we play the game , and while I ca n't force you to do it , we tell stories about how it happened . As if we were all old spinsters telling gossip about our friends / extended family.It 's also fun to try to cancel , or take death away from a character . The more you get into the game , the more you can take out of it.The theme of the elder gods really adds to the Gloom effect , I dare say even better then the original game.WHAT DID I DISLIKE ABOUT THE GAME : To be honest , the only thing I dislike is a necessary evil for balancing , so I will not sully the game by insulting their mechanics.WHO IS THIS GAME DESIGNED FOR ? Have you played Gloom ? Do you like Elder Gods ? Then this game is for you.RATING ! 6.8 out of 8 . It 's fun , but at times it can slow down if people lose their steam . If you can keep it up this game wont let you down .	1
This is a game of telling stories . Each person has a hand of plot points and an ending , and someone starts telling a story . Players can use their cards to take over the storytelling . The first to fluidly incorporate their plot points into the story , and then to get to their ending wins that particular story round . In the games I 've played , the stories are so entertaining that I sometimes ca n't break the flow with one of my cards , because I 'm more interested in how the story is going than in winning . That 's one of the keys to winning -- be a fantastic storyteller . If a story starts rambling , then people are more likely to take control.I 've reviewed previous versions of the game , so I 'll start with a comparison of versions . The art is very good in both versions : 2nd has bolder art , and the 3rd is softer with more emphasis on color than line , more storybookish . The card layout is much better in the 3rd edition , with the card type and name in the upper corners . These cards are easier to play with.Here are the changes to the main decks , listing the cards that were replaced or changed in the new edition . I approve of all of these changes . Some of them make the game more friendly . or more in tune to fairy tales.Character 2nd : Bird , Old man , Old woman , SheperdessCharacter 3rd : Dragon , Guard , Old personEvent 2nd : A trap , DreamEvent 3rd : Found , Imprisoned , Lost , Making mischief , Returned , Sleeping , This comes aliveItem 2nd : BoatItem 3rd : A trap , A well , Cauldron , Clothes , Stairs , WallPlace 2nd : At sea , Chapel , Island , Prison , Stairs , TownPlace 3rd : Church , City , Dungeon , Garden , In the sky , SwampAspect 2nd : Evil , Insane , Lost , Sleeping , Stupid , This animal can talk , This item can talkAspect 3rd : Brave , Crazy , Foolish , Healed , Sad , This can talk , WickedThe second edition had 23 ending cards , the 3rd edition has 51 ending cards ( such as & # 34 ; Which meant they would become king and queen in the course of time & # 34 ; ) . The box looks much nicer , but it 's also about three times larger than it needs to be , which makes the game less portable . If you have a previous edition , these are all factors to think about when considering whether to upgrade.I recommend all editions of this game . The cards are better in the 3rd edition , but the box is unnecessarily huge , and thus wo n't be brought to as many conventions .	1
like the idea of this game but not thrilled with the words on cards . is a very subjective game and can be difficult to play with super competitive people	1
I love board games and was skeptical about a card game until I saw it on Wil Wheaton 's Tabletop show on the Geek & Sundry YouTube Channel . The game was a blast ! ! ! The first one we played we rushed a bit too much , and the second was just a little slower , but the third time we played it ( all of these were back to back ) we were almost falling out of our seats , we were laughing so much !	1
We bought this card game last week and already I can tell that it is going to be a keeper . We played it with my 11 and 14 year olds , and they begged to play over and over again . On Easter we played 4 plus rounds with a wide mix of adults of all ages -- they loved it too , and it often became completely hilarious after someone tried to twist the story into fitting in with their ending.A couple notes:1 . The ideal game player for this is creative , reads for pleasure , enjoys strategy , thinks quickly on their feet , and has a great imagination . Others may enjoy it as well though - just depends on the group ! Also depends on whether they are board game people at all -- if you have never played anything besides UNO the learning curve would be harder , than if you are used to games such as Settler 's of Catan , and Carcassone this might be easier to play.2 . A great multi age game . Hard to find a game for kids and adults to play together -- this one works well for us ! 3 . Read the rules several times , and be sure everyone understands how to interrupt . . . you do n't have to wait until you can use an Interrupt card -- if they say a word on one of your other cards , interrupt is legal then too ! 4 . More than 8 players gets confusing / long / and it is hard to follow the story cards if you are not right at the table . We found that about 6 players are ideal.5 . Great game if you want to have a class / small group write a story -- you could do a group game and have everyone write their own take on the same plot line , or each person could draw cards and then be allowed to play a certain number and that would be their story idea.6 . Change the rules to help out the others playing . If some children are too young / not quick enough readers to play , then make them the judge of interruptions or challenges . It can be a fun game to watch as well ! 7 . There are several expansions - including one that allows you to write your own cards . . . that one we are looking forward to ! Like any card game , if you play it a lot the expansions will help vary the cards so you do n't feel like you are telling the same story over and over again . . .	1
I love this game ... but calling it a game might be the wrong way to describe it.It 's an experience that other games can not give . If you go into this expecting a card game in the line of Magic the Gathering or any other big name fantasy games you 'll either be sorely disappointed or pleasantly surprised.That said , I 've always loved the game where a group of people sits around and tells a story together and this is basically what this is , only with cards and some rather lenient rules that add to the experience.Because of the nature of the cards you have many ways to create your own games and rules as well.Quality : & # 9829 ; & # 9829 ; & # 9829 ; The cards are decent , nothing special and standard sized , about as big as playing cards.The art is nice and has a rather soft , fairy tale feel to it . It suits the mood very well and does n't force its own opinions into the story you tell.The box was a huge disappointment though . Paying for a premium card set like this I was expecting a decent housing for my collection . Instead what I got was a thin , basic card board box with heavy brown card board shoved inside to make the box sturdier . There was no where inside that the cards to be stored after opening . No compartments or anything of the sort . I was hoping for a chest design or at least something to keep the cards in place . This is one of the main reasons I ca n't give the game five stars.The box is pretty on the outside with its flap and all , but totally useless on the inside . ( think cereal box or old PC game box ) .The same applies to the expansion boxes . They are smaller but still not made to store cards in . I would give the cards a three out of four but the box is just bad as a storage unit.Fun : & # 9829 ; & # 9829 ; & # 9829 ; & # 9829 ; & # 9829 ; For me and my friends this game is a load of fun ! How fun it will be for you depends on your friends and their ability to use their imaginations.The game can get very long and sidetracked though , if you do n't have some rules laid out early on.We have so much fun that we laugh until we cry.Re-playability : & # 9829 ; & # 9829 ; & # 9829 ; & # 9829 ; & # 9829 ; With good story tellers ( or at least imaginative ones ) this game can last forever and I can see it being something a group can go back to many times over a life time . It 's even good for getting ideas for actual stories that will be written down.The fact that there are customizable cards in an expansion makes the amount of fun to be had limited only by your imagination.We 've already expanded ours to include other genres such as Arabian Nights lore , Classic Mythology and even horror ! Educational : & # 9829 ; & # 9829 ; & # 9829 ; & # 9829 ; It 's for fun ... who cares ! But no , really , this game is a good tool for learning about story structure and giving ideas . Even kids can get in on it with proper guidance and motivation . Just be gentle with their stories . ; ) Kids , after all , are the ones who will be telling stories next , so let their imaginations blossom and guide them when you need to .	1
My fiance saw Once Upon a Time : The Storytelling Card Game a while back , and fell in love with the idea before even playing.Do n't get me wrong , I love story telling , but a game that forces you to do so , that did n't seem like that much fun.In the beginning of game play you are dealt story cards , and a conclusion card.On your turn , you tell stories , playing down cards from your hand that match major plot items , or points . If you fumble your story , forget key points , or make up something to ridiculous , your turn ends.When your turn ends you have to take another story card.Play then proceeds to the next person in line , who takes the story , and picks up where you left off . You do n't have to retell the prior story , but you must consider the story the other person started , and not forget or confuse past details.If anyone during their story telling , states as a major plot point , an item that you have a matching card for , you can immediately play that card , and take over the story.Additionally there are interrupt cards that can be played when someone plays an item , aspect or character card , which also allows you to take over the story.Do n't hesitate to jump into the story though , because if you dally , you lose your turn too.The goal is to get rid of all of your story cards , and be able to play your conclusion card . The conclusion card will say things like & # 34 ; And the King returned to his thrown. & # 34 ; So if someone takes the story in a different direction , it could be hard go get your story back on track.WHAT DID I LIKE ABOUT THE GAME : I like the humor and fun of working together to tell a story , but at the same time trying to keep the story focused on your ending.Constantly thinking about how you can turn the plot points to your advantage is very hard sometimes , but if successful well worth it.WHAT DID I DISLIKE ABOUT THE GAME : You are at the mercy of the other players . One bad egg can ruin the bunch . It would n't be too hard to take the story on a long tangent , just to make it hard for anyone to complete their story.WHO IS THIS GAME DESIGNED FOR ? Creative people . Seriously , if you are n't creative , do not buy this game , and if a friend suggests it , then suggest something else . This is your only warning , because you wont have fun.RATING ! 5.4 out of 8 . The game is fun . I do n't like to play it too often because people accuse me of cheating . I 'm that good .	1
This is a very solid game , well worth having in your repertoire . As a card game , it 's very portable . The rules are mechanically simple and it 's easy to teach and learn , and fun and fluid enough to play repeatedly with the same group of people .	1
We love this game , especially considering the 1 ) great interaction , it changes every round 2 ) number of players ( 2-7 ) 3 ) fairly cheap cost compared to other games.Put the role cards into plastic card protectors and consider making a copy of the roles -- it takes about 2 games to start remembering the different roles .	1
My game playing group and I love this game . It is a mix of strategy , poker ( reading the other players ) , and diplomacy ( working with other players to stop those who are obviously in the lead ) . We have found numerous possible strategies that can be employed . Card drafting , playing with different numbers of people , and using some of the characters from the second set of characters ( also included ) make the game different and interesting .	1
This game is a lot of fun , specially when you have too many players for things like dominion , ticket to ride and catan . The game is a little complicated to play at first , as there are several roles and different buildings you need to understand properly to form a strategy . Yet with not too much time you will start understanding the patterns and the dynamics that form each player 's strategy.One particular thing that I enjoy in this game is its impression of unbalance ( which is fun , as it makes you feel like you are winning ) , but in the end , it turns out players have nearly the same score . The details are what count , not the majestic buildings .	1
This is one of the first strategy specialty card games I have ever bought . I wanted to find an easy one to set up and play , quick gamestyle , and fun . This is exactly what I was hoping for . I liked the idea of character roles and it works out great . The gameplay is easy to explain to someone , is fun , and will be fresh for awhile with the bonus expansion that comes with . Also , the box and cards it comes with are very nice . Would recommend this game to casual strategy gamers like me .	1
Members of our family enjoy Settlers of Cataan and other such games , but they do take a long time to play . Citadels takes about an hour and is n't nearly as complicated . I really like it . Other members of my family are not as enthusiastic . One thing I like about it is that it does n't completely depend on luck ( although that is a large part of it ) . It might seem a bit complicated , but it is n't . There are variations and it can be played by anywhere from 2-7 players .	1
This is a card-based game in which the objective is to `` buy '' properties to win the game.To do this , you have a range of characters you can chose from - characters like the Assassin , Thief , Magician , Bishop , King , Warlord , Merchant , etc . During the course of the game , you have the opportunity to change characters frequently . Each character has a special ability which can be used during your turn to get more gold , buy more properties , or harm other players.The overall strategy is simple - get gold and buy properties , but the range of characters allow for lots of strategy and tactics.PROS : I like this game for three reasons - 1 . ) The rules are easy enough that you can teach it to others in just a few minutes ( though teaching it to yourself will take half an hour or so ) , 2 . ) The box is small enough that you can take it with you almost anywhere , and 3 . ) It is fun enough to keep most people 's attention for at least a few games.CONS : The game can get repetitive - chose your character , take your action , buy a property . Even though there are plenty of characters , there just is n't a ton of variation after you 've played a dozen or so games . After playing for a few evenings , I have to put this game away for a few weeks so that the novelty comes back.Also , for the fun level and size of the game , the cost is high . For a few more dollars , you could buy Dominion , which is quite a bit more fun , even if it is more complex and the box is bigger.Overall , this game is fun , and is good if you 're looking for a change of pace or portability . I do n't find the gameplay long - maybe 45 mins if everyone knows how to play ( less with less players ) , and it is definitely different from the other games I own .	1
Replay value is one of my biggest concerns in buying new games , and Citdels has a great replay value as it is easy to teach to someone new and is a fun strategy game of being sneaky and finding out what everyone else is trying to do and stop them . Non stop action . Buy this game .	1
Citadels : 2-8 Players , Ages 14+ , Average Play Time = 20-60 MinutesHaving owned and played Puerto Rico ( review coming eventually ) , I was comfortable with how characters swapped out every round . As a newcomer to the game , however , I was unprepared by the amount of different strategies one could develop and did n't know which ones actually worked . My initial thought process was to acquire as much gold as possible by choosing to build the same colored district and then choosing a character that provided me with gold for having them . I quickly realized however that an observant player could utilize the thief and / or assassin and have their way with me every round as they 'd be able to guess which character card I had picked.I was also a bit confused at first as to why one card was placed face down and two face up , with the King mixed back into the deck should he show up . After a few turns as the King ( and thus , the crown marker ) , I felt reluctant to give it up mainly because I enjoyed the power of having the first pick . Then again , always choosing the King will leave you an easy target to be robbed or assassinated . I began to understand the benefits of being the King , but also why it was necessary to diversify when choosing characters . Needless to say , I still have a lot to learn.As for the cards themselves , they are simple and colorful . I enjoyed the art on the cards as well as their color tones ... I found them to be sharp and eye-catching . The bag that holds the gold pieces and the crown marker was small and resealable via the glue on it , but I would have prefered a zip baggie ... though that 's minor in the grand scheme of things.The game has a lot of replay value , especially since the expansion pack is included . Once we master ( or at least become competent with ) the main game , we 'll have a whole new array of characters to try out and new districts to build that will no doubt change the way we play . Even without the expansion pack , the way the cards are removed and chosen changes depending on how many people are playing , which may affect the strategies one might employ . Vinnie ( 11 ) and I , for example , played a two player game and we each got to choose two characters instead of one . This opened the door for different strategies that were n't possible with say , four players , as they only get to choose one character.Overall , Citadels was an enjoyable experience . There 's a lot to it that will keep me coming back for a good while . The kids enjoyed it too , mainly because they got to steal my gold and assassinate me from time to time ... guess who 's not getting ice cream after dinner tonight ?	1
First of all , this is 2 games in one because it comes with the expansion . That 's a win right there . The expansion pretty much doubles the variety and replayabililty of the game too , so that 's good.This game is good because if you pay attention you have a slight idea of what everyone is doing , but you ca n't know for sure . That leads you to syke yourself out because you plan your strategy based on what you think other people will do . Then you think to yourself , `` what if they do something else , i 'll be screwed . '' So you change your mind , but then you realize that maybe the original strategy was safer or better so you switch back . Then , you go insane and flip over the table when it does n't work out the way you wanted . If you find that experience enjoyable get this game.This game is good for 3 or 4 players . Anymore , and it becomes like waiting on line at Walmart . I know you do n't like to do that because I used my deductive sherlock holmes mind to find out you shop on Amazon . Plus with 4 or less players you get 2 turns per round . Double action = Double fun = Double strategy = Double Combos = Double Kill , Flawless victory . 2 players is good too ( because of less waiting ) , but imo the attack cards become a little overpowered and the target is , to put it simply , obvious . ( It 's the only other player , if you are confused ) .Also , you must get sleeves for the character cards . Even if you sleeve nothing else in your entire game shelf . Get 18 sleeves for the character cards in Citadels . They get handled a lot .	1
It has a really unique selection dynamic that is worth playing with if you play a lot of other style games . It is a pretty quick and fun game and works fine with two players .	1
This game is quite a lot of fun and far less intimidating than some other strategy games . I especially like how it adds an element of randomness and mystery on which roles each player chose .	1
we love playing this game , and have bought several copies to give to game-playing friends and relatives . We taught our 7 year old the basics , and play a modified version with him . It 's interesting to see the strategy he comes up with !	1
I 've owned this game for a couple years now and must say it is a great game with good strategy and re-playability . The graphics and card quality as usual with Fantasy Flight Games is excellent . The only drawback is that with the cards having a black boarder they are showing some wear and tear with color fading , but as i said I have owned it for a few years and has been in the rotation of the regular games we play that whole time . Overall definitely a card game I would recommend .	1
This is a game that I often get out when couples are over . It 's easy to play and understand , but tough to master the strategy . It 's a card game . You draw roles , and play according to the role you randomly pick . The strategy is to know how to use your card 's strength . Very fun , and fast game , that I would highly recommend .	1
I bought this on a whim at a local hobby shop and it has really been one of my favorites . The game is fun and quick and even comes with extra cards to sub in to make it that much better . The one thing I recommend is that you put the character cards in plastics as they take a beating being passed around so much .	1
It 's amazingly simple to learn . Fun for groups of two to seven . I only really have one recommendation . Get sleeves ! The character cards get passed around so much they quickly can get sticky and dirty . This can be a problem if you start using the built in expansion cards . It will be easier to tell which cards are which , which you do n't want . Half the strategy in this game is people not knowing your identity until your turn comes up .	1
My gaming group has a knack for playing the heck out of a game until there is nothing left but random chance ; This game solves that problem because aside from the deck you draw from there is no randomness . I love trying to deduce the role chosen by someone else , especially when trying to slow down the leader . There is always excitement and tension when I draw a big card and hope I survive to play it without getting robbed . This is a great game , unlike any other .	1
Admittedly , I have only entered the realm of card/board gaming within the past year . I grew up playing Monopoly , Risk , Stratego , Sorry ! , and other similar games that are easily found in everyday stores . I never realized how big of a gaming world there was outside of my little box ! Now that I know , I find myself constantly trying to find new and exciting games to add to my small collection . With that background info out of the way , here 's what I think of Citadels.Citadels is one of the first games I tried since my new craze started . It absolutely amazed me due to the unique and simple , yet surprisingly deep , game play . The goal in Citadels is to get the most points . Points are chiefly earned by building districts ( represented by cards ) with gold ( sturdy plastic tokens ) . Once one player builds their 8th district and the current round is completed , everybody scores their points to find the winner . Here 's how the game actually works . Players choose a role to play each round ( there are 8 roles in all , unless you play with the included expansion cards that include 9 ) . You choose your role secretly , and only reveal your choice when it is your turn . Turn order is decided by the role you choose . For example , the Assassin always goes first , and the Warlord always goes last . One role card is randomly dealt face down at the beginning of every round so that the second player to choose a role does n't know what the first player chose.The key to Citadels is choosing your roles wisely . Each character has their own unique skill that will help them in the game ( e.g . The Assassin can attempt to murder other players , the Warlord can demolish other players ' built districts , and the Merchant acquires extra gold ) . After everybody takes a turn , the current round is over and everybody chooses roles again . Therefore you will be able to use different characters throughout the game . Bluffing and using reverse psychology is one of the most important skills in this game . It 's often better to pass on the character that you really want to use in a given turn . Why ? Because if you consistently choose the optimum character for your current situation the Assassin is sure to assassinate that character . For example , if it would particularly benefit you to choose the Architect ( one of the most commonly assassinated characters in my experience ) then the player who chooses the Assassin could say `` I choose to assassinate the Architect '' in the hopes of making you lose your turn . However , if you anticipate this , you might choose a far less useful character to avoid being the target . The psychological mind play that goes on in this game makes for some hilarious moments . I 've accidentally killed players that were losing handily just because I guessed wrong ! Another strategy is to simply pick a character that you know would help another player just to keep them from gaining a huge advantage . The strategies in Citadels are what really excite me about this game . Strategy plays a larger part in this game than luck , which is a huge plus . Making sacrifices , taking chances , bluffing , and using reverse psychology are the name of the game in Citadels . If you do n't like being killed or stolen from , you probably wo n't like this game . But if you enjoy choosing secret roles and playing mind tricks , I highly recommend Citadels .	1
Did n't realize when I ordered this that it was entirely a card game , so when the smallish box arrived I was somewhat concerned . Have played several times and must admit to being extremely happy with this ! The game is so simple to learn , but so deep in its play that I foresee this hitting the game table many times . Every gamer should own this gem .	1
The basic rules of the game seem simple enough but things really get interesting once the players start to get a better feel for how each of the character roles work from a strategic perspective . For example , seeing a player build-up an increasing amount of gold may potentially be aiming to build more districts with the aid of the abilities of the Architect or destroy rival districts with the power of the Warlord . Thus you might want to take the role of the Assassin to kill either character role or use the Thief to steal the gold - provided you guess what the role of that player is going to be.Thus it becomes a game with a need to read your rival players well as you hope to determine what their chosen character roles are in order to gain some sort of a competitive advantage . Thus often times people will opt to switch over to being the King in order to choose his character first the next time around , however the King is a pretty high profile character that is often targeted for assassinations as well . And quirks of the possible strategies goes on and on.With the full expansions , you can play with about 2-7 players , but the game really starts to shine once you have at least 5 at the table . And the expansions let you have alternate character swap in to replace the original 8 . Or you can add in special district cards that do anything from requiring players to say & # 34 ; Thank you your Majesty & # 34 ; every time the King calls on your role or even change the end game condition to just 7 districts instead of 8.Citadels is n't your run-of-the-mill card game and it can quickly become a rather high-stakes game of strategy , especially among good friends . As always , the better you know other players , the more interesting the game as you may stand a better chance of reading them - but they can also better read you .	1
This game has great strategy , a great theme and is easy to learn . There are however two big drawbacks.1 . It is very extreme , the first two character cards that players can use are the thief and assassin . They are so devastating that if you get hit more than once by either , you 're pretty much done for.2 . Because of the aforementioned drawback , there is always 1 or 2 players who play more than half the game knowing they have absolutely no chance at winning . This is ok if you 're an experienced gamer but it 'll ruin the game for many of your friends and family if it 's their first time so be careful .	1
Citadels does not take too , too long to learn and it 's a pretty straight-forward game . The fun comes in trying to out-smart your opponent . I play with my husband and teenaged son . I think it 's easy enough for 7 and up to 'get ' .	1
Twilight Imperium 3rd Edition was Fantasy Flight 's flagship game . Twilight Imperium is a game where players vie for the imperial throne of the galaxy . Each player takes on the role of a race with its own special abilities and starting units . Starting out with one planetary system , players move out , conquering planets , negotiating trade agreements , and passing interstellar laws in their efforts to make themselves emperor.Each player selects , in turn order , a strategy card . The eight strategy cards cover the broad strategies any civilization would utilize to further its goals ( Initiative , Diplomacy , Political , Logistics , Trade , Warfare , Technology and Imperial ) . Each strategy card has an initiative number which dictates the player order for the coming game round . Thus , players must weigh the strategy which gives them the strategy bonus they need but also gives them the initiative value they want.During the action phase , players activate systems , move and build ships , buy technologies , pass interstellar laws and negotiate trade agreements . This is the meat of the game . What path to victory will you take ? Conquer your opponent ? Negotiate trades with your neighbors ? Force uncomfortable laws to the forum ? This game has it all.The most innovate aspect of this game is the supply system . Players have command counters . Using the Logistics strategy card gives you more . You use command counters to increase your supply , allowing you build larger fleets . You may also use command counters to activate systems , allowing you to build and/or move ships . Command counters also let you use the secondary abilities of your opponents ' strategy cards.Players accumulate victory points by meeting the requirements of objectives . These could be conquest , trade or technological related . A broad strategy is needed to have a competitive edge.The game ends when a player reaches 10 victory points or when the `` Imperium Rex '' objective is revealed . Whoever has the most points is declared the emperor.This game , while worthy of a 5***** rating is not without its baggage . The Imperial strategy card is quite bad . You should use the Imperial II card ( or play with the expansion ) . Also , the technology tree is overly convoluted . Some of the laws are not as spikey as they need to be . Due to the game 's adaptability , I can easily overlook these flaws.Twilight Imperium takes about 4 to 6 hours to play . This means you will spend the better part of a day playing this epic game . This is not a gateway game . Newbies will be overwhelmed by its depth and complexity . This game is strictly for the hardcore gamer . If you ever wanted to play a space game with awesome bits , epic theme and multiple paths to victory , Twilight Imperium is the game for you .	1
Fantasy Flight Games ' & # 34 ; Twilight Imperium 3rd Edition & # 34 ; is quite simply the greatest space opera game you will find on the market today . No other game comes close to matching its sheer scope and its ability to suck players into its grand narrative . Players take on the role of one of several alien races as they vie for control of a dying star empire . An asymmetrical game , each race has different abilities that they can use to their best advantage . The game itself is not simply a wargame , not simply a game of area control . Rather , & # 34 ; Twilight Imperium & # 34 ; encompasses many different mechanics and ideas , and importantly provides many avenues to victory : Will you win through outright military conquest ? Will you win through political domination of your opponents ? Will you win by successfully engaging in trade and economic warfare ? One of the things that makes & # 34 ; Twilight Imperium & # 34 ; so great is the many different choices you have throughout the game.A cool mechanic is the strategy cards , which allow the person who chooses them an important advantage in one area , but allows other plays to do something cool too . This is a great way to keep all players engaged every round and making sure no one gets board on someone else 's turn . This game does boast quite a few rules and concepts that you need to know , so it 's not a game that you can jump right into , but if you are willing to invest the time to learn it you will be richly rewarded.The thing that really makes & # 34 ; Twilight Imperium & # 34 ; come alive , however , is the epic stories that the game tells . You and your friends will love reliving the tension of each game during the post-mortem , and for years to come . It really is a game that comes alive each time you play , and great story telling is the hallmark of a great game .	1
This game is so massive it scares all of my lesser nerd friends away . C'mon guys it 's not that hard . Learn the difference between a round and a phase ...	1
This is a great Space Conquest game . The more players the better . It has nice plastic pieces . Gameplay is pretty cool as there are different phases per turn , such as Movement , Diplomacy , Economics and Technology , among others . These phases transpire in different orders each turn , keeping things fresh and unpredictable . There are a good number of races to choose from , each with their own special powers . There are several different ship classes to build . The board is large , with many planetary systems to conquer . The board also changes from game to game as the board consists of large cardboard hex pieces.Twilight Imperium 3rd Edition can , at times , be a long game , but overall it is a fun and cool game .	1
Twilight Imperium is an amazing experience . In this game , 3-6 players take on the roles of alien races in a crumbling space empire . It is the goal of all players to re-establish the empire and claim the throne . In order to do this , other players must be destroyed ( or at least put off ) . Of course , space combat plays a large role in this game , but this is not just a game of space combat . Diplomacy , trade , and politics are also portrayed in the mechanics of this game . The thing that I really like about this game is that there is a psychological side as well -- how well you succeed will sometimes depend on how well you can convince other players that what will benefit you will benefit them as well.I highly recommend this game . However , there is one thing to be aware of when you purchase this game . It takes a fairly long time to play , especially for new players of the game . I would recommend budgeting 6 hours at least for your first game . If spend that much time on a boardgame does n't appeal to you , then this might not be the game for you . However , every time I play this game , I have a blast . Also , unlike many other boardgames , you 'll be talking about the strategy of the games you play even weeks after the game is finished . This is where I think this game really succeeds -- every game creates a story that the players really get into . So , if you 'd like to take a chance on an epic game , you ca n't go wrong with Twilight Imperium .	1
First off , this game is a blast ! I 've played it a few times and every time is unique , challanging , fun , and most of all , it creates memorable moments . Word of warning , though , if you 're new to more complex board games , this one 's a doozy , but do n't let that scare you away from the game . When learning how to play , it helps to have the board set up and sort of mock play a few turns , reading ALL the directions and playing through the scenarios the rules cover . The first game you actually play might move a bit slow at first , but once all the players learn how the turns work , the game moves along at a good clip .	1
I love this game and it gets a fair amount of play time - considering the average game takes 3 to 4 hours . The rules are very complex , so it 's not really a great game if you 're new to board games . The biggest downside ( and the greatest attribute of the game ) is all the expansions that keep adding to the game . I love having them , but I have spent sooooo much money on this ... well worth it , though .	1
Arkham Horror can be best described as one thing : one of the best board games ever . That being said , not everyone will grow to appreciate Arkham Horror 's creative and comprehensive gameplay , but those who do are in for a fantastic adventure . The game basically puts you into the role of someone who is stuck in a town where the Cthulu mythos is just starting to set in . You take on the roll of a few different characters , each with their own positives and negatives , and work together in order to vanquish whatever elder god you are faced with defeating.This game feels like a more-structured version of D & D . ; You make skill checks , have random encounters , and you try to make your character armed to the teeth with stamina , sanity , weapons , spells , and skills in order to overcome whatever evil you might encounter . You also spend a majority of your time tackling forces that work against you , as well as work on closing gateways to other dimensions that can spawn monsters . Ultimately you will seal the evil away , or find yourself faced with the ancient god , who you must defeat.The game is n't as difficult to understand as some may have you think . Having a basic understanding of D & D ; rules helps quite a bit , so as long as you can figure out how many dice you get to roll for each task you want to accomplish , the rest of the game should be grasped fairly easily . My only gripe with this game is that the board game itself has broken already . Being a 6-pannel plane , I was n't sure how it folded back into itself , so when I tried folding it the wrong way , it broke at the slightest amount of force . It still works fine , but the durability of this product is quite poor . Regardless , I have immensely enjoyed this game after playing through it 3 times so far , and ca n't wait to get the two big expansions that add the two other towns to the map . Do yourself a favor and buy this . Not only can it be played with any amount of players , but no two games are ever the same .	1
This is an intense game which requires a lot of thinking . It takes quite a while to setup and during our first session took us two hours to go through all the rules since none of us had played it before . Also took us 4 hours to finish our first game . But we are gamers and enjoyed its complexity and story . Its definitely a must for a gamer 's collection but not a short game . Set aside time for this one .	1
Arkham Horror is loosely based off several stories of the famous HP Lovecrafts world , with some more contemporary figures thrown in as well . You play a team of investigators attempting to prevent the awakening of one of the great horrors of Lovecrafts universe , running around town , aquiring spells and equipment , fighting monsters and exploring otherworldly realms.The game is well paced , easy to figure out , though the learning curve is a bit steep , and is capable of near infinite replay . The characters and primary enemies are so varied and and so different to play that it would be almost impossible to play the same game twice . The `` encounters '' are entertaining and incredibly varied ( probably close to 300 different all told , though most are for the Other Worlds ) .The problems arise in a few ways . It is incredibly difficult to make money , it is very easy for monsters to quickly overwhelm the group , and the cusp of victory seems to get pushed back repeatedly , as the one gate you manage to clsoe but not seal is where the next gate appears . Dying in later portions of the game can easily spell doom , as you have to sit for the next several turns reaquiring health and sanity , and even then , theres a monster just outside that you ca n't sneak by and ca n't defeat , and never moves.Overall , the game is incredibly fun and entertaining , but can drag if you have a run of bad luck . Its very easy to start to rush , bypassing crucial steps that could 've saved you had you remembered to do them . The rules become second nature very easy , and with the addition of a few house rules , can easily become a household favorite , right up there with betrayal at the house on the hill .	1
This game is complex and could n't be less to be in the same level of Lovecraft 's writes ! ! ! If you are a hardcore board gamer this game it is for you ! ! ! !	1
Everyone should buy this super hard co-op game . Everyone against the board / elder god and it 's still hard to win . Go on , you know you want it .	1
Let me start by saying I do not own this game . I bought it for my nephew on his 17th Birthday . My purchase was based on extremely positive buzz about it at my local game store , and his request . I read the rules before I gave it to him and we played a session that night with some of his friends . Let me just say , that the buzz was not wrong . This is a very good Chtulhu inspired game ! This is an excellent game for serious gamers who are fans of HP Lovecraft and the Cthulhu Mythos . I say SERIOUS because the length of a single game can easily last more than 3 hours . Especially if everyone does n't read the rules beforehand.I found the game mechanics to be different , ( You roll 6 sided dice to complete a skill . A 5 or 6 is a success , and the number of successes you need is based on the difficulty of the task . The number of dice you roll is based on tools or weapons used and other factors ... ) You travel around the board finding clues/weapons/allies that can help you achieve your goal.PROS : GAMESTYLE : Cooperative gameplay , it is set up as players against the board . There is even a solo play variant . Bascally , the players team up to prevent one of Lovecraft 's Elder Gods from entering our reality and reaking havoc therin . They must close gates , and fight monsters alonfg the way . If it gets to the point where the Elder God has broken through , there are rules for that , but basically , you 've lost.DETAIL : THERE 'S TONS of IT ! This game was very well developed by people who definitely know the topic . HP Lovecraft and his Mythos/World are very well represented . There are scores of monsters straight out of Lovecraft stories ! REPEATABLY PLAYABLE : Enough variation for multiple plays without too much repitition.EXPANDABILITY : Plenty of expansions if you are into that sort of thing.QUALITY : The board and components are of very high quality as per most Fantasy Flight Games I have had the pleasure to play . I love this company ! SUPPORT : There are multiple sources for support on the web . It has its own Wiki , and is featured on the Fantasy Flight Games support site and others . Rules questions can be easily answered this way.CONS : INTIMIDATING : The rules seem a little daunting at first . This is illusary . Keep at it and you will find that they are actually quite straight forward . Still there are a few questions we had after only one play which we had to look up on the web . Post reading te rules after the game cleared up a lot of questions.HARD : It is not an easy win . Even though the gameplay is cooperative , it is very possible that EVERYONE DIES , and the board ends up winning . If you are looking for something simple to do , this game is not it . It is very easy in the game to be sent to the hospital or driven insane , although in truth these are only minor setbacks ... SPACE : This game requires a LARGE table to set up on . Think dining room table plus a leave , not a kitchen table.EXCLUSIVITY : This is NOT a game for everyone ! If you are unfamiliar with Lovecraft and Cthulhu , or are not a serious gamer , this may not be for you . This is the only reason I did not give this game 5 stars . I LOVE IT , but you might not.TIME : This is both a positive and negative . This is not a game you can finiish off in 30 minutes . It is a game you will probably spend the whole night playing ( 2 to 4 hours ) . Personally , I LIKE that . Others might not want to invest that much time.All in all I was very impressed by the game overall . I can not believe I never played it before . I am looking to buy a copy for myself pretty soon , as I am a huge gamer and Lovecraft fan . This game is right up my alley . For now I have been making myself content with reading the rules for all the different expansions which have been posted on line . Each has it 's own special flavor to add that I find very interesting and impressive . I see this as a very good game that I will probably spend a couple hundred dollars on before all is said and done .	1
Arkham Horror is a board game designed with a relatively unique concept in mind . Instead of pitting players against one another to decide the winner , Arkham Horror pits all the players against itself ( or the board ) in epic 1920 's style Lovecraftian horror setting . There are numerous reviews here on Amazon emphasizing the complexity and difficulty of understanding the rules . I purchased the revised edition and without knowing when these other reviews were written , I would have to say that it is much easier than it looks . Do not let the large amount of playing pieces , the number of card stacks or the sheer number of options available to you as a player intimidate you.The game consists of multiple ways for a team to win . But the ultimate goal is for players to work together to prevent one of the classic Lovecraftian evils from overwhelming Arkham . These Ancient Ones ( as they 're called ) hinder the players in many ways from spawning gates to Other Worlds to releasing monsters in the streets that terrorize Investigators ( player characters ) and the citizens of Arkham . It is the players ' job to protect Arkham and its citizens by discovering clues about the Ancient One and its evil minions before the town is completely destroyed and deserted . This can be a terrifying task for players but often times games come down to a last ditch final battle against the Ancient One himself after he has awakened ! After purchasing from Amazon , spending an hour or so watching YouTube totorials and giving the rules a good read through via .pdf file on the internet before the game arrived I was ready to get things started when the game showed up on my doorstep . As expected , the quality of any Fantasy Flight game is unsurpassed . The art is great and the game pieces are all very impressive . At the time of writing this , we have managed to win two of the four total games we have played with the original box and are already looking into expansions ( of which there are many ) to make the game more in depth.In closing , this game is simply incredible ! I could write more about it , but I 'm keeping this as short as possible in hopes that people who still read this feel influenced to purchase this game and delve into the world of Lovecraft and enjoy a night of gaming in the exciting world of Arkham Horror .	1
I am continously impressed with this game . I must state that I am a long time HP Lovecraft fan and as such give this game extra points because I can associate the theme with my favorite stories . This is one of my favorite games . I will give a detailed review.The Good -The artwork is excellent . Even if you do not know anything about HP Lovecrafts stories , the art work still looks pretty cool.The Game is 1 to 8 players . The part I think is cool is that you can play this game by yourself . This works out if you cant find anyone to play complex board games with or if you want to give the game some practice runs before trying to play with a group . I suggest giving the game a couple runs through by yourself to get rules down . The game is complex and your friends will be more likley yo enjoy the game if you can quickly explain how to play instead of poking through the rule book trying to figure out what it going onThe game constantly changes . The game has many components and at first glance this can put people off because it makes it appear more complex than it is . The game does have tons of cards of all sizes with diffirent colors which need to be seperated while you keep track of a sheer with moving stats and a pile of resources . A player will not use all the componets at once though . The large bulk of components such as cards are only used in certain situations and thus expand the games ablity to be more diverse . I am most impressed with this games ablity to constanly shift . The designers have come up with ways to make the game enviorment , situation , monster placement , stats , and movement and objectives and more subject to change based on random card interactions and players choices.The game grows . Expansions have come out and likely will keep coming out for this game . You do not need the expansions to enjoy Arkham Horror , but each expansion adds new elements to the game . Some can add new characters or bosses to use while other can add an interesting twist on game mechanics.The game can be dumb downed . Not to call anyone dumb , but complex rules can be a buzz kill to those just starting . Not every rule needs to be strictly followed and it does not hurt to drop extra rule to lesson the difficulty or complexity . Imagine it like a videogame where you change the difficulty . Ignore monster ablities or allow trading when not in the same location.The story telling . A plot unravels and you can choose to pay attention and get into it or just play it as board game . You have choose a character who has a story and this character is exposed to random circumstances which tell a story . My adivce is to enjoy the story as it unfolds.The Bad -The game take up allot of room to play . This is not too painful a negative point and overall I think it is worth it . The game may be more complex if it was smaller . But I usually end up playing it on the floor because my kitchen table is only a little round table and can not cotain the board and all the cards needed to lay this out.The complexity . This is not a game most people would be able to take out of the box , figure out after brushing through the rules and understand after one play through . For those with complex gaming experince the basics might be easier to figure out , but not simple . This being said , DO NOT LET THIS SCARE YOU AWAY ! The rules may take some time to figure out , but they are needed to keep the game the constantly shifting living atmosphere that it is . This is why I suggest a few play throughs by yourself before teaching others ( or learn with a friend and figure it out together ) Even if you are checking the rule book every round for the first couple of games you will still be having a blast . I have played through whole games with friend and after the game is over we noticed we had a rule backwards or ignored completly and laughed about it . ( maybe next time ) The most important rule in these games is to have fun . If rules get to complex than drop or dumb them down.The game length . This game can take a long while to play . If you play it alone expect around 3 hours , if you have 3 or 4 people expect 3 to 6 hours ( depending on attention span , boss , and random chance ) I got not idea how long a 8 person game would take . If you dont mind playing games for long hours than awesome . I do not see this as that big of a con because the type of game it is should take more than a half hour to play . The game has depth and content . Most great board games take time to play , even monopoly.Conclusion -I am likely forgetting something awesome to tell you all , but the bottom line is that if your a die hard Lovecraft junkie than this is a must have . If you are not a Lovecraft junkie , but like horror and games , this is for you as well . If you are a vetran gamer who needs a new game to conquer , you wont be let down . If you are not a vetran gamer but are looking for something net , you will also not be let down . If your a collecter and you like to have a bunch of cool looking neat stuff around , you will have fun with this . The only reason I see for not liking this game is a dislike of the genre ( horror or games ) or a dislike for taking the time to learn something new . I suggest you pick this up .	1
This game was a monster to learn . Do not try and get down all the rules first and then play . Just fill in missing rules with your best guess instead of digging through the manual to find that rule you ca n't recall on your first time round . Besides , you will probably come up with house rules anyway ( everyone takes their move simultaneously when we play ) .On the other hand , the time invested learning to play this game was well worth it . Members of our family that do n't like complex game enjoy playing this , which is clearly the most complex game we currently own . Once the rules are understood they are intuitive and easy to play with . They take on a sort of transparency and the scenario the game represents jumps to life . Then it is a lot of fun to play.The game feels oppressively difficult at times , but that adds to the feel of the scenario the game represents . If you want a cooperative game you will always win , look elsewhere . If you enjoy a challenge , then you may have come to the right place .	1
This game is a devastatingly brilliant example of a co-op game ( all the players team up in an attempt to beat the game itself ) where there is a near-perfect game balance . Unlike many other co-op games , this one feels like tactics can make a difference , and though it 's not easy , victory seems achievable . Even more important , losing the game is just about as fun as winning ( and very much in keeping with the Cthulhu Mythos genre ) .This game is very complex , however , and I highly recommend a rules- and detail-oriented person take the lead , facilitating the ability of other players to enjoy the game without getting bogged down in detail . In the case of this game , the complexity is enjoyable and well worth it , but it is notable because it may overwhelm new players and give them a bad first impression .	1
Arkham Horror is a hard game to win , but it is a lot of fun ! It can also be quite long . Adding expansions adds to the fun , especially more monsters , investigators , items and spells . Not all expansion rules and boards need to be used , however . This is a neat game , as you move around the board attempting to increase your investigator 's power , defeating monsters , and closing gates ( which spew forth more monsters if you do n't close them ) . Meanwhile , a slumbering Ancient One of great evil gets closer and closer to waking up - and then all investigators do battle with 'It ' ! This is a very cool game .	1
Just to clarify , there 's nothing really complicated about the rules , there are just a lot of them . The rulebook does a great job presenting them , but I wish the paper stock was sturdier since I have to refer to the rules so often , and it 's somewhat flimsy magazine grade . But each page is packed with lots of things to remember , and I 'm thankful for the guy who posted a 13-part series on youtube on how to play . Fantasy Flight should hire him to do other video tutes . Starting up your first game will feel a little sputtery because you will have to check the rules so often , but after around the 10th turn it 'll all come together and the fun of the game will take over . Lovecraft is popular in games right now because his works came out of copyright and into fair use , and board game companies have jumped all over that . This one however , seems to be the definitive one of them all ( with a nod to Elder Signs if you want a quicker fix ) . The theme shines through and really does a great job painting a picture of investigators running all over a town , closing gates , portals to another world , and trying to keep the number of monsters coming through at a minimum so the town 's not overrun with them . As the game progresses , the town 's fear is recorded on the Terror Track , and people ( allies you could have actually used ) will leave town , and businesses will close their doors ( so you ca n't go into them and reap their benefits ) , until finally , unless you 've sealed enough gates , you 'll have to face The Ancient One , the `` boss '' monster for the game . Depending on his difficulty and your strength level when the battle starts , you 'll either celebrate a hard fought victory or you 'll have your butts handed to you . Or in the case of one monster , when he awakens the world ends because humans are just too puny to even fight . If you like Lovecraft ( or Edgar Allan Poe or Stephen King or turn of the century-themed creepiness ) , you 'll absolutely love this game . Everything about it , like the prose on the location encounter cards , do a perfect job of making you feel like characters in a story of a supernatural struggle to save the world . Clear off your biggest table because it takes up a lot of space ( even with the helper iphone app ) and get ready for an exciting ride in Lovecraft 's world .	1
I bought this game because I like Lovecraft 's work . The game itself is very fun and addicting . It 's not hard to set up and the rules are not difficult . I do n't know about these people who have `` degrees '' who ca n't figure it out , but I 'm glad I did n't take their word for it . The idea for this game is very fun and It can be played solo .	1
This board game is a retread/rethink of an older game by the same name that attempted to capture the feel of the RPG Call of Cthulhu experience in a board game format.The good : The artwork is superb and the cardboard pieces are very sturdy . The replay value of this game will be high provided you can live with the `` almost always lose '' philosophy of the design . The mechanics are not difficult ( see explanation of why people think they are under `` the bad '' ) .The Bad : Losing all the time . This is really a matter of luck , but a few bad die rolls at the game start can make the game thoroughly uninteresting from the get-go as characters spiral uncontrollably into uselessness . More thought should have been given to breaking the game into initial , intermediate and end-game phases when it comes to the mythos threat.Need for high player-character count . Play with two and you 'll see what I mean . Solo play ? Fergeddaboutit ! Waste of time unless you field many characters . See `` footprint '' for why this is inconvenient.Rulebook : Horribly disorganized . In the post RPG world game companies have forgotten how to write rules so you can jump into the game and figure it out as you go ( like the old Avalon Hill games used to work ) . You 'll be clawing all over the bedsheet-sized rulebook ( about 2 square feet when open ) looking for that vital special case even if you have an indexed version of the rules since stuff can be in sidebars instead of the main text . Epic fail.Footprint : The game takes up acres of space what with cards decks and card displays and the board . I 've heard that some people have played with all the expansion boards too . I envision them using a banqueting table to do so ( though later expansions have smaller rulebooks ) .For the money it is n't a bad deal if the milieu floats your boat , but this is a `` dolls house '' game in which the temptation to keep adding expansions to see how it improves the play will be expensive and irresistible.If you are looking for a game that offers a more `` realistic '' Call of Cthulhu game feel and gives the players a chance to actually win ( losing to the mythos threat is something that can be judged to take place over geologic timescales , it does n't mean every encounter is fatal for Azathoth 's sake else Inspector Legrasse never gets out of the swamp with the statue and the story never gets told ) I 'd advise saving your money and buying `` Mansions of Madness '' , which has been much more popular with my gaming friends ( albeit costing about twice what Arkham Horror does ) .	1
Arkham Horror is one of my favorite board games of all time . Unlike the vast majority of games ever devised , the players are placed into a cooperative - not a competitive - environment , and with good reason : the horrors of H. P. Lovecraft 's imagination have sprung to life and the eve of the Apocalypse has come ! This rich setting , coupled with the quality and intricate detail of Fantasy Flight 's design , provides countless hours of enjoyment for fans of tabletop strategy games and mythical worlds . Also , numerousexpansionsets exist to inject new life into the base game , like adding additional neighborhoods to a Monopoly board.Each turn requires a good deal of maintenance and upkeep , as if you are in a role-playing game where everyone shares dungeon master duties , or playing a video game where the computer 's calculations must be done by hand . This level of complexity , as well as the subject matter , make it unsuitable for young children ; any teenager or adult comfortable with Magic : The Gathering or Axis & Allies will likely master the mechanics in two or three sittings.As others have noted , the rules are at times almost incomprehensible ; I sometimes wonder whether any two playgroups have ever played by the same interpretation of the rules , let alone the correct one ! It is completely understandable that some people dislike the game because of this fact , but for those of us who recognize that the point of the game ( from the monster 's perspective ) is to drive the players insane , that is to be expected !	1
No bones about it , this game can run long . But it does an excellent job of walking a group of players through a cooperative walk right through an HP Lovecraft horror story . And best of all , no two games will ever be the same.Definitely one of my favorite games .	1
I had ( and still have ) the original `` Arkham Horror '' board game published by Chaosium in 1987 which I bought around the same time . To be honest , it was never much more than a novelty , being the onlyH . P. Lovecraft-themed board game , and it seldom made its way from the closet to the gaming table.Imagine my surprise then , when I found this 2005 re-vamp of the game . This version of `` Arkham Horror , '' from production values to gameplay , is in an entirely different league . Unlike the Fantasy Flight edition ofTalisman : The Magical Quest Game , another classic boardgame which kept the original game play intact and only really upped the ante on production values , `` Akham Horror '' has been given a complete overhaul , keeping the fundamental tone and a few elements from the original but basically inventing a new game entirely.Like the 1987 version , the core game still revolves around a team of Investigators attempting to close a series of gates before the `` Doom of Arkham '' track advances too far and the big nasty awakes . This is a cooperative boardgame , meaning the players work together as a team and the enemy is the game itself . Everyone either wins or loses together . This is accomplished by splitting game play into separate turns , the `` Mythos Phase '' where the monsters ' movements are controlled by random dice rolls and game rules , and the `` Player Phase '' where the players are allowed to make decisions using their characters . Character attributes are borrowed from the role-playing gameCall of Cthulhu , and include things like Luck , Stamina , Sanity , etc ... I enjoyed the parts they kept from the 1987 version , including some of the cheesy character names like `` Joe Diamond '' and `` Monterey Jack . '' I am glad they ditched the original cheesy art though , as this 2005 release is vastly superior . There are sixteen characters here , up from the original eight , and far , far more monsters creeping out from between the pages of Lovecraft and his weird fiction circle . While the production values are nice all around , I do wish they had included plastic figures for the characters as they did with the release of `` Talisman . `` Be warned before picking this up though ; game play for `` Arkham Horror '' is INCREDIBLY complicated . There are a seemingly infinite set of variables affecting the game , and each must be dealt with in turn . Which Great Old One is drawn from the random pile at the start of the game means a variation in rules , creating an easier or more difficult game every time . Along with that , Events can be drawn that drastically effect the rules , and each player has Character specific conditions that need to be watched . I have played `` Arkham Horror '' several times now , and there are still certain rules I do not quite understand . A single game takes a long time , not because of the basic length of the game but because of the number of times you will be reaching for the rule book looking for clarification.Because this is a cooperative boardgame , you can even play it by yourself if you are a Johnny No-mates who ca n't find friends for a game . I played several games by myself to try and learn the rules before springing it on other players , and I recommend you do the same . It feels a bit strange at first , to be alone in the house rolling dice , but I suppose it is no different from the long hours spent playing video games alone ! The complicated system does mean that `` Arkham Horror '' is a game you will not soon become bored with . The game changes almost every time , which is a lot of fun but can be frustrated for casual players .	1
Owned this game for over a year and thoroughly enjoy this game.Players compete to outscore the other player by playing off their lines of colored shapes . However , there 's 6 different colors , and the lowest of the colors is the player 's score . So skillful balance in scoring the various colors is required.The game starts out easy enough and is quite pleasing to the eyes to watch as a white board becomes filled with all the pretty colored tiles , but as the tiles slowly come together , the game becomes much more tense as players get blocked out and options to score colors get less.The components for this game are great . Nice plastic tiles and a nice plastic rack designed to be quite durable with it 's own cloth bag . Stores away quite well.Recommended for those looking for an abstract tile placement game .	1
Ingenious is a very unique game that uses tiles kind of similar to dominoes . The rules are a little difficult to explain , but I 'll give it a shot . Each tile has a picture of two different shapes ( one at each end , similar to dominoes ) , and there are six different shapes in the game . On each turn , players place their tiles on the board and get points for the number of tiles adjacent to their 's that have the same shape . You keep track of how many points you get for each shape . The object of the game is to try to get 18 points for all six shapes . You need to pay attention to the shape that has the fewest points , because that 's the score that counts at the end of the game . The player whose lowest score is higher than everyone else 's lowest score is the winner . Also , each player has their own scorecard which sits right in front of them , so everyone can see and keep track of each other 's score . It might sound confusing at first , but it 's one of those games that 's easier to understand once you start playing.The game is beautifully designed and requires a lot of strategy in order to win . You ca n't just focus on getting a lot of points for one or two shapes , because it 's your lowest score among the six that counts in the end . One of the things I like about this game is that it has so many tiles that you never have to worry about running out of a certain shape . Also , if there 's a shape you do n't have in your tray and it 's also your lowest score , you can exchange all your tiles at the end of your turn for six new ones from the bag . Because of these things , you do n't need to rely too much on luck to win the game . If you play your tiles in the right places while following not only your score but also your opponents ' scores , you 're going to have a good chance to win the game.Overall , Ingenious is a great and somewhat unpredictable game that keeps you guessing and altering your strategy . Anyone who consistently makes smart decisions with where and when to play their tiles throughout the game is likely to win , but that can be a lot easier said than done . One bad decision can make a big difference in the overall outcome of the game , and you may find yourself thinking something like , `` Why did I play that tile there , '' or , `` Why did I wait so long to play that , '' or , `` Why did n't I wait a little longer to play that . '' I never get tired playing Ingenious . It 's a great mind game that requires more strategy than luck to win , and it really has become one of my favorite games .	1
The rules are about two sentences long and off you go . Terrific gateway game for people who have played Othello but maybe never played a `` euro game '' . Rules are along the lines of dominoes and the components are quite nice . Lots of room for improvement the more you play , but early plays are equally rewarding . GREAT GREAT game .	1
Ingenious , 2-4 Players , Ages 10+ , Average Play Time : 30-45 MinutesI honestly did n't think that matching colored shapes would be fun . I was genuinely surprised by how deep this game is while managing not to lose its simplistic innocence . You 'll notice right away that Ingenious is sharp and colorful . The game comes with a velvet bag of playing tiles , a set of racks , a playing board , and set of cardboard scoring sheets and pegs.Each player receives a rack and six tiles . The tiles are kept hidden from the other players . Players also receive a scoring table and one colored peg for each column , representing their score for each colored shape.The board itself is hexagonal in shape . You 'll also notice that the areas on the two outside `` rows '' are shaded two different colors and the majority of the board ( the inside ) is white . Two players will use the spaces in the white portion only , three players will include the spaces in the second to last shaded area , and four players will include ALL spaces.There are six different colored shapes in this game . As players lay their tiles on the board , taking turns , one at a time , they 'll be scoring ( moving ) the appropriate colored pegs on their scorecard . The amount of points you get is based on how many not only border the same colored shape you just placed , but how many are matched up in a row . Players do not count the colored shapes that they just placed as part of the score.For example , if there were four purple circles in a row and I placed a tile that added a fifth purple circle to that row , I 'd score four points plus whatever other colors bordered that tile that were of the same color . If any of those had a row of tiles of the same colored purple shape , I 'd score those too.You perform the same scoring procedure for the other hex on your tile , you score your points , and the turn ends . If you manage to get any one of your colors up to 18 , the highest on your scorecard , you get a free turn.Here 's the kicker ... your final score is NOT the combined total of all of your points from the six columns of colored shapes ... it is whatever the LOWEST score you have showing in one of the columns . If you had 15 red , 14 blue , 12 green , 18 orange , 15 yellow , and 2 purple ... your final score would be 2.This opens up a bit of strategy ... do you try to focus on one color and quickly build it up or focus on some or all of them at once and slowly build them up ? Also , if you see your opponent ( s ) has a low score of one color , you could try to place your tiles in such a way that cuts off everyone from connecting to it.The hardest part of this game is getting used to the scoring mechanic . Once you are onboard with it , it takes maybe five seconds to add everything up . Annoyingly , moving pegs on your scorecard can be a chore for fat fingers ... I personally do away with the pegs and keep track on paper . I simply write down the player 's name and assign one line of each color going down . As players score on a color , I 'd add the points to the existing number , write down the sum , and cross out the old number . One of these days I plan to create an Excel sheet anyone can print out and use.I highly recommend this game for its simplicity and strategy factor . It also happens to be one of the most requested in the house by the thirteen and ten-year old when we hold a game night . It may not appeal to hardcore gamers that prefer spending entire weekends playing Risk , but for families looking for an easy game to play on game night , you ca n't go wrong with Ingenious .	1
This is a fun game , and it scales really well from 2 - 4 players . My friends and family have really enjoyed playing this . The scoring rules are what really make this game great . Having the lowest number , no matter what the color , be the player that loses makes for some great `` take that '' blocking opportunities . Also , for parents of children , my 6 year old was able to play this with me with only minimal coaching . Also , the box is designed well to house all the components , which are also very well made .	1
This game is one that I often forget how much I like . It 's really a very nice game , which can be hard to express . The basic object of the game is to create long chains of the same symbol adjacent to one another . Six blues in a row , or three greens , for example.As you go , each other player is doing the same thing , and you 're all trying to get the most points in 6 colors . But the real trick that makes this game work so well , is that you 're scored on whichever color you have the least points in at the end of the game . If you score a full 18 ( the maximum amount ) for 5 of 6 colors , and only have 10 points in red , your final score is effectively 10 . It 's a little more complex than that in the full rules , but not much . Because you 're scored on the least of the 6 colors , you 're not just racing to the end , you 're balancing all of your colors as you go.This subtle challenge in this game is what drives everything else . Everyone needs everything , and obviously that ca n't happen . You have to block some chains , while scoring on others . You want to keep track of who needs which colors at what time in order to get your lowest score up while keeping others from getting past you.It 's a simple premise , and as a result , quite simple to teach , learn , setup and play through . There 's no story or atmosphere , but it does n't matter . This is a great game that can be played with the relatively young ( I 'd guess some ten year old kids with the interest and patience would be fine with this game ) through as old a player as you can interest in trying the game.There are adjustments for 2 , 3 , or 4 players , and the game plays equally well with any of those numbers . I 've played many 2-player rounds with my wife , and it 's a favorite of ours . No fantasy atmosphere , no complex rules with player reference sheets , just a well devised game that 's really a good time to play . The travel version is two-player only , but is also excellent . It 's exactly the same but smaller , excellent for two people .	1
I normally do my research on boardgames before I buy them . As such , I watched a couple of reviews on youtube and comparative `` best Board Games '' lists online.I bought this game for playing with my kids and for friends that do n't like to play complex games . It 's as I expected . Simple to learn and easy to play . A good one for one 's collection . Not so good for hardcore strategists .	1
This is a fun brain burner - on the lite side . We love the way the game plays ( 120 equally sized pieces , each consisting of two joined hexes , come with the game . There are symbols on each hex that make up the piece - some pieces have two identical symbols , some have two different symbols ( not unlike dominoes ) . The goal of the game is , through clever placement , to obtain points in the different symbol colors . Points are claimed by placing a piece such that the symbols on it lie next to already-placed pieces with the same symbol . ) This is a game that all the kids can play , though with adults , the strategies can become subtle and challenging . Loads of fun ! !	1
I play a lot of Board Games . I play so many that I have a collection of games that are very fun , but very hard to teach . Ingenious is the exception.Ingenious is a simple game of placing tiles on a board and then counting the number of matching symbols to score points . It 's easy to teach and easy to learn . And it 's immensely enjoyable.There is a deep game in this simple idea of placing tiles on a board and making the best chains of symbols . It 's so easy that kids can play and do well and that adults can play and try to use strategy and still come in second to the kids.Most of the games in my collection are hard to explain . There 's games with rules that change each round about who goes first , or there are games that have special rules about what you can and ca n't do on your turn . Ingenious is not one of these , it is a game that is Simple and Complex at the same time . It 's a lot of fun and it 's really easy to teach and still is one of the most enjoyable games I 've ever played.I would recommend this to anyone that is looking for a good board game that they can play over and over again . Something that is more fun than Monopoly and which wo n't always be won by the same person as you sometimes get in Scrabble.I know I sound like a snob writing this , but I kind of am , but even as a snob I think this is one of the Greatest Games I 've ever played . Heck , I even have fun playing the Single Player variant which I usually think feels tacked onto a game but for Ingenious it works perfectly and still feels like the regular game .	1
I really like `` themed '' board games , but I ca n't always get people to try and play those types of games with me . This one seems to have pretty universal appeal though . Six types of symbols are on 2-sided hex tiles ( like hexagonal dominoes ) . Play a tile and get a point for each matching symbol connected to the ones you laid down . You can teach anyone to play this game in 2 minutes , and finish a game in 20-30 minutes . Not for pure strategy buffs , due to the element of luck in drawing tiles . If you want a new twist on pure strategy where everyone starts with the same pieces , try Blokus . Even if you like pure strategy , give this one a chance . Simple rules and playable with 1 to 4 players ( including team play ) give Ingenious the potential to become a modern classic . Maybe not pertinent to the review , but I noticed that this was a `` Game of the Year Finalist '' in 2004 . The game that won that year was Ticket to Ride . Great year for board games !	1
This game deserves much more popularity in the US than it seems to have ! Simple to learn , very entertaining ! A must-have addition to any family board game collection !	1
After playing and enjoying Lost Cities by game designer Reiner Knizia , I decided to stop by our local game store and check out Ingenious . Last night my wife and I played it for the first time , and as with Lost Cities , we loved it.Immediately after playing we wanted to play again . There is no doubt in my mind that we will not tire of the game . The common quality that Lost Cities and Ingenious share are the `` addiction '' factor ; both games will have you saying `` let 's play again '' over and over again at the expense of sleep . I do n't believe a greater compliment can be said about a game than this.Ingenious is incredibly easy to learn , and takes less than 1 minute after setting the game up for you to begin playing . Game play consists of playing hexagonal chips of 6 different colors on a board in turn-based play . The chips are like hexagonal dominoes , have 2 hexes connected , and each hex containing a different color . Once no chips can be placed upon the board , the game is over . The player who has the lowest amount of points for any of the 6 colors loses . Game strategy requires that you score points for each color , and this requires concentration and strategy.Understand that Ingenious is not a strategy game that will leave you frustrated , overwhelmed and weary . No , ingenious is not like that . Ingenious has just enough strategy to have you scampering to win , and just enough random luck to make it unpredictable . And my favorite part of Ingenious ? All players know that when the board is full , the game is over . There is an end in sight , and just like Lost Cities , you play against yourself just as much as you play against your opponent . Your strategies can kill you , or leave you the victor . Spend too much time acquiring points for one color , and you might sacrifice your victory.Try it , you wo n't regret it . I paid over $ 35 at my local gaming store , and it was worth every dollar . The game is of sturdy components , as to assure you will be playing it in 10 years . For 1 to 4 players . Yes ! You can even play this addictively fun game solo !	1
great item I even play it and i am 58 it is a long game but fun so a great gift .	1
The Dunwich Horror is classified as a 'large box ' expansion for the original game , Arkham Horror . The Dunwich Horror is NOT a stand alone game and requires a copy of Arkham Horror to play . The 'large box ' refers to the fact that Dunwich Horror expands the original game board by an additional 1/3 size . In addition it adds to the number of cards in all the decks which contributes to the uniqueness of each game ! The Dunwich Horror is highly recommended as one of the first expansions for new Arkham Horror players to purchase after the original game for a few reasons which I will write about below.First and foremost , aside from broadening the game from investigator items to gate and mythos cards , the Dunwich Horror box adds a two new decks to the game that have a positive impact for overall gameplay . These specifically are called the Injury and Madness decks respectively . Both of these decks allow for investigators to go insane or be knocked unconcious without taking a huge loss in items and clue tokens . These cards are minor ( most of the time ) hinderances , but can end up killing an investigator or making life very difficult if the wrong cards come up.The new addition to the Arkham board features the outlying town of Dunwich . The board has the same principles as the Arkham board with one exception . There are vortexs located off of certain neighborhoods into which monsters will move ( provided the right mythos cards cause the monsters to move ) . If enough ( 3 ) monsters fall into vortexs , an incredibly powerful monster will spawn in the middle of the Dunwich board ( The Dunwich Horror ) and make life miserable for investigators . Aside from being very difficult ( or requiring a massive stroke of luck ) to defeat , the Dunwich Horror will not move , but instead have a chance to hasten the chosen ancient one 's awakening by adding doom tokens to the doom track . This essentially makes Dunwich games require an investigator ( sometimes two ) to occasionally visit Dunwich to close gates , and kill monsters before they enter vortexs . This helps keep the game stable and provides Dunwich investigators an opportunity to help close and seal gates to win the game.The Dunwich Horror includes a variety of new monster tokens and some familiar ones to add to your collection of monsters . Most are not overly threatening , but there are some that have new and unique methods of movement . On the flip side of the coin , this expansion adds a nice chunk of investigator cards ranging from new common items , unique items , spells and skills that help boost your investigators fighting prowress and offer new strategic wrinkles that were n't originally possible in the base game.Not only are there new investigator cards , a new board , new monsters and brand new investigators but there are new mythos cards that introduce a new game mechanic which has profound effects on game play . These mythos cards are called Gate Burst cards and they have the ability to destroy an elder sign ( gate seal ) at a location and spawn a new gate there . These of course can provide a significant set back to investigator teams , but also help combat positive 'momentum ' encountered in the base game after 2-3 busy locations have been sealed in the base game . It helps to keeps the game exciting until the very end because sealed locations are never truely safe from a new opening gate ! Last but definitely not least , The Dunwich Horror provides four new ancient ones with which to do battle . All of these provide rather unique experiences and offer their own specific mechanics that affect game play in various ways . Overall , the most fun ancient ones we 've encountered have been from Dunwich ! In closing , The Dunwich Horror is a great addition to Arkham Horror and provides a wide variety of new options to explore to make your Arkham experience more rich . You will want to incorporate many if not all of the features from this expansion into your Arkham games on a permanent basis . A final note about this expansion ; adding it helps significantly to lower the total play time required for a game . Our base Arkham games average anywhere from 3-5 hours . We have yet to have a Dunwich game go over 3 hours . This , of course , can be attributed to our growing familiarity with the game itself but also in the increased difficulty brought by most of the Dunwich components ! All in all , I highly recommend !	1
Arkham 's first big box expansion . It 's a solid add and goes nicely with the game , though future expansions integrate better and add more . It 's a great expansion to get if you 're a newer Arkham player and are ready to ramp up your games , but not quite ready to make it as intense as future expansions make it .	1
The creepy village of Dunwich ! This is a fun big box expansion ! I have n't yet had the Dunwich Horror arise yet , thankfully ! Adds quite a bit to the game . It 's really fun and I 'm glad I have it . The injury cards you can use anytime so that was fun to acquire from this . I would recommend this to anyone who like Arkham Horror !	1
First released in 2006 , theDunwich Horror Expansionis an essential add-on to theArkham Horrorboard game . Players of the base game wondering which ( if any ) expansions they should purchase would do well to begin here ... in addition to giving the most bangs for the buck in terms of new cards and game mechanics , later sets incorporate or build on the Dunwich changes , so you might as well start at the beginning.Pages could be filled outlining how every new addition changes the feel and flow of the game , from major effects including gates bursting open , permanent madness and injuries , and monsters actively stalking you , to more subtle strategy alterations like exhaustible allies and skills with penalties ( imagine the look on my face when my 3 / 7 character drew Mythos Lore , - 1 max sanity ) . Suffice it to say that every change makes the game less predictable , more challenging , and more suspenseful ... and we have n't even talked about the new Ancient Ones or facing the Dunwich Horror itself ! There is very little to criticize with this set , its only flaw perhaps being that it is far too difficult for one or two characters to play with any hope of victory . Players willing to manage more than one investigator each will find the challenge enjoyable , though ... at least until the monsters eat them.Bottom line : hardcore fans own this expansion already . Every casual player should .	1
Great strategy game as we 're blown away after getting the game as its much more fun than expected . I watched a video review on youtube about it before buying and it looked promising . I think what first comes to mind is think Settlers of Catan but instead you set the dice where you want for what resources you need ... so its sorta similar to that game in that way . You build stuff and then battle monsters as well so it has a little more to it . Settlers is a fantastic game as is this .	1
This game is very easy and a lot of fun to play . I got it because I like playing dice games but there is also a good amount of strategy .	1
Kingsburg is a worker placement board game designed by Andrea Chiarvesio and Luca Iennaco . The game is published in the United States by Fantasy Flight Games . For its price , quality and game play : Kingsburg is the best gateway game on the market.Players strive to score the most victory points . You score victory points mostly by building . In order to make buildings , players must have resources : gold , ore and wood . Buildings give players several benefits such as bonuses to battle , extra resources , and manipulation of dice rolls.Players have a town mat in front of them . This shows which buildings they have built . The buildings on the far left are entry level . To make buildings , you must have both the appropriate resources and have built all the other buildings to left of the desired building . Thus , long term strategy is required when deciding which building paths a player will take.Players acquire resources during the productive seasons ( spring , summer and fall ) . There are 8 phases in the game of which 3 are productive seasons . Players roll three dice ( 6-sided dice ) . Players play one or more dice onto the game board . The game board has 18 spaces numbered from 1 to 18 -- representing all the advisors from the Jester ( 1 ) to the King ( 18 ) . To influence an advisor ( and receive the bonus thereto ) , a player must place dice with the correct total onto that advisor 's space . Thus , to influence the Jester , a player must place a die with a `` 1 '' onto that space . If you did n't roll a `` 1 '' , you can not influence the Jester . Players can place multiple dice onto an advisor in order to influence the more powerful advisors ; again the total of the dice must equal the advisor 's value.Some advisors give victory points ( the Jester and the Queen ) ; some give soldiers ( the Sergeant , Captain and King ) and most give resources . If a player influences an advisor , no other player may influence that advisor during that season . So there is an important strategy to where to place your dice.There are 5 years ( 8 phases each ) in the game . During the 8th phase of each year , there is a battle . Players must defend the kingdom from the kingdom 's enemies ( goblins , orcs , barbarians , etc ) . If the player 's battle total from soldiers , buildings and the king 's aid is greater than the enemy 's total , the player is successful , else the enemy wins . It is possible ( and quite probable ) that some players will be successful while others will be unsuccessful . Those who are unsuccessful are sacked by the enemy , losing the appropriate buildings or resouces listed on the enemy card . Those who are successful gain the booty listed on the enemy card . After 5 years , the game ends and the player with the highest victory point wins.Kingsburg is easy to learn for non-gamers . The iconography is intuitive which aids to its gateway nature . There is a great deal of replayability in Kingsburg also . There are plenty of ways to win.The only problem with Kingsburg is the way the battles are handled . The king 's aid is a die roll . This eliminates so much strategy that it renders this aspect of the game meaningless . The expansion solves this problem luckily.If you want a fairly cheap game with great replayability and that 's also the best gateway game on the market , I highly recommend Kingsburg . If you like Kingsburg but think something is missing , I also suggest picking up the expansion .	1
Relatively simple compared to other games in the genre , it is a great introduction to worker placement games for players who like dice components and do n't mind that random aspect to the game . Plays relatively quick , about one hour , after the first learning game . An expansion is available if you enjoy it and want to add more options to your game.This game works well with 3-4 if you do n't like being blocked by the worker-placement mechanism in board games , but as the number of players goes up the more likely you will not get to select everything you want.Colorful art and a large board brings the game to life .	1
I got a chance to play the game at a Board Game Meetup and it was a great game . A lot of thinking and lot of dice rolling help you build medieval buildings that allow you to win via a victory point system . I was overwhelmed by the simplicity of the game and the wealth of strategic decisions demanded in every turn . It was the first game for all 3 players , but we got done in about 2 hours . I figure you can get through the game in 90 minutes with a little bit of replay . The other great thing about the game is that it has so many various ways to victory that it demands to be played again and again . I do n't own it yet , but I will buy it .	1
As noted in my other relevant game reviews , I 'm I am always looking for games I can play with my fiance . She is what some would call a `` reluctant gamer '' whereas I am an avid gamer , so I have be careful about what games I introduce her to . She prefers games that rely at least a little on luck ( i.e. , not all strategy ) and are n't too complex ( i.e. , where you can learn/remember the mechanic after a game or two ) , whereas I love strategy and complexity but do n't mind a little luck . We also like games you can finish in a single session ( or games you can play multiple times in a single session ) . This game fit the bill perfectly.You roll lots of dice in this game , which is not only fun but adds the luck component she likes . Yet , there is also some meaningful strategy choices in terms of what advisers you select ( and when you select them ) , what buildings you build ( and when to build them ) , and how much of an army to build up each year . Even without the expansion we found this to be a great game , but the expansion adds tons of re-playability and makes it even better in many ways ( I also review the expansion on its product page ) . I should also note that the game rules include a specific two player variant to make it work with two players ( you include an extra set of `` dummy '' dice that randomly take up spots first ) ... definitely makes the two player version more fun and interesting ) .	1
Easy to learn game . Has a lot of replay ability . You can win multiple ways . My wife and I love this game . I bought the expansion and I love that too . Solid game that I am glad I have in my collection . I think you will love it as well .	1
There are a few really good reviews that review the game play so I 'll just tell you about how everyone loves this game . We came across this game while staying with my Uncle . My cousin pulled it out to play and my husband and I were immediately hooked . I ordered it as soon as we got home and waited and waited for it to be delivered . As soon as it got to our house we took it out , had some friends over and played it with them . They also loved it and have since gone out and bought it . We play this game at least once a week . We pull it out when family comes into town and play it with them and we have n't had anyone who has n't liked it yet .	1
In Kingsburg , each player is responsible for developing and defending a piece of the king 's realm . Players receive assistance from a number of advisors who provide the resources for success . At first glance , success or failure appears to be luck of the dice . In reality , there 's a lot of strategy going on here , and a well thought-out plan can minimize a bad dice roll . It all comes down to the buildings , which are grouped into five categories that each have their strengths and weaknesses . In each category , buildings must be built in order , with each successive building giving you greater benefit but at a greater cost . At the end of each round , all players must defend their land from some sort of aggressor . Points are awarded by buildings , by advisors , and by winning battles . There are also some mechanics built in for helping the last place player catch up to the rest of the pack.Kingsburg works well for two to five players , though the game experience is different with two than it is with five . Games usually take about 90 minutes , and possibly a little longer with inexperienced players . Kingsburg strikes a good balance of luck and strategy and is easy to teach to new players . I have two minor complaints on aesthetics . First , the yellow dice are difficult to count up because they use white dots instead of black . Second , the advisors would feel more real and less like a game mechanic if their names were printed on the board . These are minor problems , but they do detract from the playing experience . Overall , Kingsburg is a great `` light strategy '' game .	1
We 've only played this once since buying it , but so far so good . It does take much longer than most games to play . And your first game will take almost 2 hours because you need to figure out all the rounds and what to do on each round . Definitely huge potential in being one of our favourite games .	1
My wife and I are starting to get into more advanced board games as we age . We have always loved games such as monopoly , clue and other such games . We decided that we wanted to spread our wings and try a little more complex game . This was a fantastic choice ! When I say it is advanced it is by no means hard to play . It has smooth gameplay that I believe all ages could learn . The entire game revolves around your decisions as governor which buildings you will build to ward off invading armies . This leads to the decision of prestigue building or defense . Everyone in our family loves this game and it has given us hours of enjoyment !	1
Kingsburg , for me , ranks up there with Ticket To Ride , Settlers of Catan , and Carcassonne as a game that will make people remember how much fun board games can be . Other reviews have spent much time on the mechanics and strategy . I just wanted to add another positive review , because I think Kingsburg is a good `` gateway '' game for people who are used to rolling dice , but are new to `` turn phases , '' resource management , and worker placement . Simple enough to teach and play a game in about 90 minutes , but enough strategy to appeal to experienced board game fans . If you play these types of games often , and do n't like the random element of rolling dice to determine which resources you can acquire , I can recommend Puerto Rico , Lords of Waterdeep , or Olympus.Only 4 stars due to the tendency for a few strategies that seem to work more consistently than others , as well as lack of challenge with the winter battles , but there is an expansion you can purchase separately if you play often and want greater challenge and variety . If you do n't plan to own very many board games of this type , Kingsburg should certainly get high consideration , especially if you enjoyed any of the other games mentioned above .	1
For a fantasy game fan , just browsing Fantasy Flight Games ' catalog can be comparable to an alcoholic strolling around a liquor store : Too many choices , intriguing all . As I 've been using what spare time I can muster to methodically sample various treats from said catalog , Kingsburg has been on my `` to do '' list for quite some time . In a recent `` free-shipping induced '' online ordering binge , I finally slapped ol Kingsburg into the virtual cart with high , if somewhat hazy , expectations.Low and behold , after several close rounds of play , I am pleased to report that Fantasy Flight has managed to put out another winner in the fantasy board game genre , this one a combination of resource management , basic combat , and opponent-oriented strategy.If , like me , you find yourself attempting to make some sort of logical game play assessment based exclusively on the back of the box 's description paired to photos of the ( seemingly insanely complex ) game in play , let me begin by putting your mind at ease . The game is deceptively intuitive after only a full 90-minute play , perhaps even earlier than that but by the second full game , you 'll find yourself referring to the 8-page rulebook less and less.True to the teasers , you assume the role of one of the king 's governors in a land with apparently very invade-able borders . The idea of the game is to come out furthest on the board 's outermost scoring track at the conclusion . Pacing the flow of things is both a seasonal and annual counter ( 4 seasons per year/ 5 years total game time ) . Not to worry if five years sounds like an awful big commitment , a table of experienced players will enjoy complete game times between a little over an hour to an hour and a half maximum.I mentioned resource management and indeed , that element represents the core of the game play mechanic as dice rolls determine which of the king 's royal court will toss a few goodies in your direction ( these goods range from gold to building supplies to soldiers ) . Each turn ( season ) , players allocate their resources to constructing buildings , building up their army , or just stockpiling materials for later use . The catch is each year come wintertime ; the malevolent forces from outside the land 's borders come a knocking . Players who neglected to prep their armies during spring , summer and autumn will pay severe consequences should they falter to the invading orcs , barbarians , zombies , and dragon forces.This all sounds terribly complex , I 'm sure and photos of the game board with its depicted hierarchy of characters , dozens of in-play dice , markers , chips , and player sheets does little to dissuade the notion . However , after a few minutes of actual playtime , it becomes very clear that whoever designed the board initially had an outstanding perception of the game 's intricacies as nothing , and I mean nothing , on it is without purpose . Markers keep track of everything from the given season and year ( remember there 's only 5 total ) , to which player gets to roll first in a given season , to the precise payouts each advisor provides , to how many soldiers you 've got recruited into your army . All of the building construction is kept separate from the board on the player 's individual province sheets . Hard commodities such as gold bars , wood , and stone are represented by appropriately painted wooden blocks . The more familiar with the game one becomes , the more he comes to appreciate the detail and amount of information the game board contains on every square inch throughout.The rules themselves are pretty clearly presented so long as you do n't make the mistake of attempting to comprehend them without the actual game components set up before you . I found that the quickest and easiest method to get underway was to actually follow the setup section precisely and to actually go through all of the motions on the board for a full year ( 4 seasons ) along with the step by steps of the instructions . After which , starting over for an official game begins to feel quite intuitive . Fortunately the rules are presented in a very orderly fashion , complete with full color examples for nearly any situation , making quick reference to iron out the rough spots very convenient.The pieces and bits are typical Fantasy Flight Games which is to say beautifully illustrated , constructed of unprecedented quality , and come within a box loaded with plastic storage compartments to insure that everything fits neatly within . Setup is quite minimal and in this case limited to a bit of card sorting , stacking up some wooden blocks , and retrieving the tokens , wooden markers , and wooden dice to correspond with your chosen color.The game 's greatest strength perhaps is its practice of not pitting players directly against one another but rather as individuals against the rigors of the kingdom . Decision making and resource allocation factor heavily upon the game 's outcome over luck of the draw elements or random card flipping . In the end it 's basically a player versus other player ( s ) situation even though it rarely feels like it during the course of play . I 'm pleased to report that there 's very little in the way of punishment or trickery to opponents . Again , players will find themselves quite involved in managing their own affairs , which is appropriate since it is their own decisions throughout that ultimately determine the game 's winner.In all , Kingsburg is a fantastic entry in a saturated market and further proof that Fantasy Flight Games is quite serious about their craft . Highly recommended entertainment !	1
This is an amazing GoT themed card game that is VERY well balanced for each house represented . There is a lot of good replay-ability and my gaming group chooses this to play a lot . We liked it so much we got several of the other expansion boxes , but this added so many cards it kind of detracted from the fun . I had to get 2 binders to hold all the cards ! This made deck making a bit cumbersome . I would recommend sticking with just this base game unless you really want to go all out and take a lot of time making decks with the expansions .	1
I only have the this stand alone set and no other expansions . I have had a chance to play around and get a good feel for it . I wont go into depth of how the game mechanics work , thier is a how to play video here on amazon that pretty much covers all of that . I have played a bunch of other card games such as magic , call of cthulhu , WWE Raw and others . I mention this because I think this game is easier to learn than many other card games . I am sure many people enjoy complex games that take a long time to figure out the rules and the long discussions on how the rules exactly work . This is pretty cut and dry and that makes it easier for other people to pick up on . I would call it a good gateway game.I have read the books and love the show and this conveys the theme and feel very well . The people who make this game ( Fantasy Flight ) Always make beautifully crafted and illustrated componets . One thing I was concerned about was that the cards might contain accidental spoilers to the story . ( I am avidly against any spoilers ) But I was pleased to see that it does not do so.The bad part is that the 4 pre-made decks are not exactly balanced . The Lannister is a beast for acumilating gold . The Starks are almost unable to participate in intrigue challanges . ( I understand that the intrigue challanges are meant to be such as shady under the table kind of actions , yet not being able to attack or defend in one of these challanges makes you discard cards from your hand and your opponet get more power tokens . ) While this may be realistic to the story , it is not balanced . You can view it as a challange or a negative . If you buy expansions you may be able to level the playing field . Though it may add more depth to the game and add the enjoyable possibilty of custumization this stand alone set is really all you need.Overall the game is worth the money and is allot of fun . It takes about an hour to play and can get intense with how fast the scales of victory can be tipped . Unlike in games like magic where if you have the correct cards you can build a nearly impenetrable defense this game pushes you to try and win while forcing you to become paranoid if you are making the right move .	1
I used to be a big Magic : The Gathering fan years ago , and am a fan of the books and TV series which inspired this game as well . I purchased this to play with friends who were also familiar with the source material , but not so much with LCGs ( Living Card Games , for those not in the know ) in general.So far , I 've found the game to be far more enjoyable than Magic if there are 3 or more people playing . The play waters down a bit with only 2 people but is still enjoyable , just not as deep or potentially intricate . The learning curve is a little steep for someone not familiar with LCGs , so if you 've never played one , be prepared to grind through one or two 'rough drafts ' of game play before you actually fall into its rhythm . GoT features a very cool , ever-shifting ( in my opinion ) political sub-mechanism which layers the game play well , and there are rules variants included to broaden that depth even further ( note : the political aspect is unworkable for and is not used in 2 player games ) . The physical design of the game is above-par , and much of its artwork is beautiful if not heavily stylized . The box is not so sturdy , though . Mine lost a corner on day 2 , but honestly , that 's NOT a big deal , and so far is my only complaint.This core set includes a full deck for 4 of the 6 houses ( Lannister , Baratheon , Stark , and Targaryen ) as well as House Cards ( Which admittedly do n't do much for this set ) for Martell and Greyjoy . If you wish to play the latter 2 houses , you will need to buy the appropriate expansion packs for them . The decks come 'pre-tuned ' and ready to play . Also included are a game 'board ' ( more like a placeholder for game data and a reference sheet as no game play occurs on a board ) , a cardboard sheet with gold and power token knockout pieces , and 6 plastic multiplayer tile pieces ( the aforementioned political aspect ) representing 6 positions of power in the kingdoms . Each tile piece conveys its own special bonus ( es ) to its holder , and creates ( or denies ) opportunities for cooperation among players . Players work to be the first person to accumulate 15 power tokens among their House and characters , while preventing others from doing the same.Perhaps my favorite aspect of this game is the ability to launch up to 3 different types of challenges per turn . These challenges are designed to either kill enemy characters , steal their power tokens , or remove cards from their hands . Some houses are better at one type of challenge than others , so it 's up to the player to maximize the potential of their deck contents.If this sounds fun to you , you 're going to enjoy it . If it does n't , you probably wo n't dig it much . If you want to get into the GoT card game , THIS is the starter set and is all you need to get a taste of it . This is not the strategy board game associated with Game of Thrones . **** What is an LCG ? ****for those of you who do n't know , these games are played using cards and without a traditional board or game pieces . Players use cards which represent Characters , locations , events , plots , and agendas . Each card has specific values and meaning , some of which can be shaped by the context in which they are played with other cards . I liken it to playing chess without a board , with only the pieces in play visible to your opponents . You do n't struggle to make pairs , or three of a kind , or to collect cards from other players to make a hand that 'wins , ' or anything like a traditional card game typically attempts . There are no absolutes to the rules as many of the cards have their own traits , identities and functions listed on them which tend to frame the basic rules around it . These games are somewhat abstract and require abstract visualization and a solid capacity for strategy to be enjoyed . They also , while somewhat quick to learn , take a good amount of play to become an adept . They are , therefore , not great choices for younger children ( 13 and under I probably would n't recommend , but just because of that ) or casual game night unless everyone 's played an LCG before.Hope this helps ! -Jason	1
This is a fun board game , that can handle up to eight people . It is not hard to pick up , and a quick explanation can allow new players to understand the basics enough to play in a few minutes . It would be best if at least one person had a detailed understanding of the rules , as there are a few things that come up that do n't happen often . It has a unique way of handling turns , which ends up rotating who goes next in a fashion that is unlike most games -- it is based off of how many & # 34 ; turns & # 34 ; ( or minutes ) an individual takes at any given time -- the more they take , the longer they wait for their next turn -- based off of how many turns other players take as well.It is amusing , and challenging . But with a lot of new players , can drag on a bit , if people do n't fully understand the strategy . A full game can take two hours if you have 8 people , many of whom have never played it before . This can cause the game to get a little ... tiresome , and is best if enough people know what to do and can plan ahead of time ( This is true for all board games of this type ) .	1
I absolutely love this game . It 's a great co-op game that leaves you struggling to the very end . While the small board and box add to it thematically , I think the second printing came in a bigger box , and would likely be better .	1
I received this game as a Christmas gift , and somehow did not play it for a whole nine months . I 'm glad I did , though ; it 's a riot ! The theme is quirky and fun ( drunk gnomes on a submarine ! ) , and the gameplay is pretty quick , once you get the hang of how to use the time counters . There is a significant amount of randomness in the events ( Eurogamers , beware ! ) , but this is fitting with the theme . The fact that it is a cooperative game that scales up to eight players is great.So , the story is that you are a bunch of Gnomes on a doomed submarine , the Red November . You are being pursued by the Kraken and everything is failing . The crew will be rescued when 60 minutes passes , but you have to work together to survive that long . Each player tries to avert disasters by attempting repairs or other actions , which take time . Gameplay passes , not in a typical clockwise fashion , but to the player whose gnome 's time counter is furthest back on the time track . The designers really do an excellent job of making you feel you are working against the clock.In short , the game is great . I highly recommend this if you are in the mood for a light , fast and chaotic good time .	1
I bought Red November based on the only other review here.We have family game night 2x a week with 2 adults and a 13yo . I was looking for a cooperative game to play . The only other true cooperative we have isCastle Panic , which is also a great game.Let me point out that this game takes place aboard a gnome submarine therefore everything about the game is small - including the board , the cards , and the pieces.At first the game was so boring , my eyes were glazing over while I listened to the rules being read aloud as we tried to play . However after a few rounds the rules just clicked.The game play was fairly quick . It took us about 30-40 minutes to play , including trying to learn the rules.We laughed so hard that we could barely draw new cards . Several parts of our submarine caught on fire , we dealt with a few floods , and one of our players became a drunken , staggering gnome as we desperately tried to find him a cup of coffee as an antidote . Some people might be offended at the fact that the gnomes drink beer , but it is n't really the focus of the game . The gnomes have 4 hit-points ( lives/health points ) and each beer they drink takes 1 away from their points . If he has a beer , drinking it gives the gnome an advantage to repair certain `` problems '' that arise throughout the game . Besides , it made the storyline very funny.We did escape the submarine and win , but only barely.We 'll definitely pull this one out again next time . Thank you Mitchell in VA for reviewing the game !	1
Red November is a cooperative game in which the players win or lose as a team.The conceit is that the players are the crew on a Gnome Submarine ( do n't sweat the gnome bit - it plays only a `` color '' role in the game ) . This submarine is the worst maintained craft to ever set sail and the crew spend all their time fighting fires , pumping floods , fixing the engines or the oxygen pumps or the reactor or the eager to self-launch missile armament . And if that is n't bad enough , *someone* really should go out with an aqualung and a spear and kill the Kraken before it cracks the hull like an eggshell.The game features an innovative time-line movement scheme in which everything a player does costs time , the player can decide how much in most cases , and after the player has fixed the engines or put out a fire or pumped a flooded room out ( etc ) the time is accounted for and Bad Stuff happens - like more fires breaking out , rooms flooding , hatches jamming , engines quitting , reactors overheating or missiles announcing their intention to launch in ten minutes unless someone does something about it . This means that players precipitate trouble for everyone but mostly whoever comes after them in the move scheme ( though in my first game someone managed to re-flood a room they 'd just pumped out and drowned as a result ) . The last person on the timeline is always the first to move , so everyone sort of keeps up with each other on the clock as it were . It looks strange but works well and there 's a tactical element to using one 's move intelligently.Each time someone gets a turn they can move as far as they want ( or are able to given the jammed hatch/flooded compartment/blazing inferno situation ) , then they take one of a limited set of actions , check for getting killed and do bookkeeping ( which is where the events happen ) .Events and gear that help players out are presented as cards and are easy to understand.Gnomes get the courage to go into burning rooms by drinking grog , which makes them tipsy , which can make them faint . This is bad ( because fires and floods can happen while you are in a dead faint , and that can kill you ) . Gnomes can drink coffee to counter their drunkenness.I had the misfortune in my first game to open the action by setting fire to the two rooms in which one could pick up gear , and every effort to address this state of affairs was stymied by the deplorable failure of just about everything else between the crew and these rooms . Half the crew survived , but only one room in the sub was dry and not on fire by then , and the reactor was halfway and more to cooking off . Do n't get me started on those wretched engines that almost took us to Davy Jones 's Locker every third turn or so . It was the most fun I 've had in ages.The physical make-up of the game is impressive . Pawns ( gnomes ) and movement markers are plastic , reactor , engine and oxygen status markers are wooden blocks color-coded for their respective tracks , the cards and counters are sturdy & well-printed , the board harkens back to `` The Awful Green Things from Outer Space '' and presents the playing surface and various status tracks clearly . The artwork is amusing and entirely in keeping with the theme , which is inspired in it 's humor.The rulebook is clearer than the usual FFG affair , but there are some ambiguities in the first half that are clarified only in the detailed second half . For example , the first description of the situations arising from adjacent rooms with different levels of water in them will have your players drowning unless you go to the second , more detailed description . The wording is just wrong in the first attempt.That notwithstanding this game harkens back to an age when boardgames were popular and ubiquitous , and so were easy to learn.Highly recommended .	1
This is a great strategy and action game that is highly thematic . Essentially this is a cooperative game where the players are supposed to be working together , except that at least one player will end up being a traitor and nobody knows if it will be when the game starts or if it will come halfway through the game . The traitor tries not to be detected while subtly sabotaging the efforts of the human players to win the game . If the Cylon gets discovered then they can be even more deadly be directly throwing obstacles into the path of the human players who are trying to survive . There is a lot of tension as accusations fly and bids for power are made between the Admiral , President , and other characters in the game . What happens if the President or Admiral are secretly Cylons ? What if they are both Cylons ? Run through this game to find out for yourself . Every play feels like an episode of this great sci-fi adventure .	1
Fantasy Flight Games 's Battlestar Galactica is the board game representation of the cult hit television series . And when I say , `` representation '' , I mean it . This game is the perfect marriage of theme with board game . Those who are aspiring board game designer who need inspiration for who to make their games more thematic : look no further than BSG.Battlestar Galactica was designed by some of the usual suspects at FFG : Corey Konieczka , Eric M. Lang , Jeff Tidball and Mark O'Connor . The game accomodates between three to five players and takes about 2 to 3.5 hours to play.The goal of BSG is different depending upon which side you are on : human or cylon . The humans must make one faster-than-light ( FTL ) jump after they have travelled 8 parsecs ; the cylons must prevent this from happening by either destroying the Galactica or eroding the Galactica 's resources.At game set-up , players secretly receive a loyalty card.There are two types of loyalty cards : human and cylon . These cards remain secret throughout the game . Players may never willingly reveal secret information . After the Galactica has jumped a sum of 4 or more parsecs , a second ( and last ) set of loyalty cards are dealt out . If you have a cylon card , you are a cylon . Thus , players who start the game as humans could quite likely end the game as a cylon ! The humans need to negotiate crises after each turn . Failure to negotiate a crisis usually costs the Galactica some resources . Should a resource fall to 0 , the game is over and all cylons are winners.The resource dial is turned to show the new value when a crisis is failed.In order to negotiate a crisis , all players will secretly skill play cards from their hands . All crisis cards and all skill cards are color coded . If the skill cards match the crisis ' color , the skill card aids in the negotiation of that crisis ; if the color , however , does not match , the skill card makes the crisis that much more difficult.Two random cards are also added to the crisis resolution so that no one knows for sure if the crisis was sabotaged by the cylons ! Players assume the role of one of the main characters on board the Galactica.Each character has a skill set appropriate to their character . This is the amount of skill cards they will draw during their turns . The characters also have some special abilities and a special weakness that really rounds out who the character is.Players will move around the board during their turns in order to obtain more skill cards or to `` put out fires '' . Parts of Galactica may have been damaged which requires a player to repair . Cylon raiders or basestars may be in the vicinity requiring the Galactica to make a military response.Colonial One gives the President some quorum cards which are quite powerful.The game continues until the Galactica has made jumped after reaching the 8 parsec marker , when the Galactica is destroyed or when any resource reachs zero.Battlestar Galactica is a gamer 's game . It 's rich in theme . The game is one of bluffing , intuitition and some deduction . There are ample opportunities for resource management . This is a competitive AND cooperative game . The game is enjoyable to those who are not familiar with the television -- although if you like the show , you will almost certainly love this game ! The quality of the components is high . The box is high quality cardboard with linen . The bits are thick cardboard or durable plastic . The cards are high gloss with full color pictures on them . The only complaint I have with the nuts and bolts of the game is the storage compartments : there are none ! You will have to find some creative way of storing your BSG game if you want your bits to be organized.I recommend this game to anyone who likes RPG 's and is reluctant to try board games . I recommend it to anyone who likes the TV show and likes board games in general . Also , if you like mind games , BSG is a game you ought to try !	1
As the headline suggests , I love Fantasy Flight Games ' & # 34 ; Battlestar Galactica : The Board Game. & # 34 ; Simply put it is just a lot of fun . One one level , it is a cooperative game that constantly forces you and your friends to make tough choices . This is a hallmark of a great game when it is done right , and & # 34 ; BSG & # 34 ; is absolutely done right . Secondly , this is a game of personalities , where you and your friends ' ability to bluff and counter-bluff will be tested to the limit . While the crises inherent in the game make for a tense , tough experience that is wonderful all on its own , the hidden traitor mechanic and the way in which agendas are constantly evolving makes a stellar game absolutely sublime.I 'm not discussing deep rules or even basic concepts here . I simply want to communicate what this game makes you feel . In a word : Paranoid . And you and your friends will have an amazing time wading into an abyss of suspicion and accusations , and you will all laugh a lot , if only to relieve the tension . Great for fans of the TV series and easily playable and understandable by those who 've never seen it , & # 34 ; BSG & # 34 ; is simply an amazing game that you will fall in love with. & # 34 ; So say we all. & # 34 ;	1
The game pieces are good quality . I was impressed.The game is thematically true to the series , and captures the atmosphere well . Though the rule book looks intimidating at first , once you start to play , it all comes together in a very real way . The game is incredibly exciting . I highly recommend .	1
I do n't think I have ever played a board game that so perfectly captured the feel of the source story . Lies . Betrayal . Paranoia . Enemies in every corner and the universe stacked against you . As the human player , you know full well that if you win it is only going to be by the skin of your teeth , and certainly not with all of your crew intact . In fact , after several games we finally had our first `` win '' last night after a hard fought battle . It was a brilliant , suspenseful game with the power balance of the Cylon players and the human players coming down to a single flipped card.The game play is complex , and takes an investment of time to learn the rules . LikeArkham Horror , this is a game that highly benefits from having a resident rules lawyer who can guide less-experienced players through the phases and their options . We found 4-5 players to be just about right . A typical games lasts about 3-4 hours , and it can be a long wait in-between turns with too many players . We have one of thePegasus Expansion , that adds to the complexity and game length.The element I love the most about Battlestar Galactica Game is the secret Cylons . That single piece adds so much tension and enjoyment to the game . Until the final reveal , you never know who is on whose side , and it all comes down to the finest of wires . A single flip can change everything when one of your allies reveals himself as the enemy . That was a brilliant bit of game design , and keeps the game fresh every time you play .	1
Feels like a real adventure game . I really enjoyed playing with my friend and family . Really good buy . Prepare for a very long game if you are playing with a lot of people .	1
Great game for the fantasy and rpg buffs . May seem imbalanced , but there are many ways for the different characters to succeed . Best with 3-6 players .	1
This was one of the games that started it all ! I played it twenty years ago and longed to own it when it went out of print . Kudos to Fantasy Flight Games for reprinting it ! I am sure they made lots of old school gamers very happy with this re-release.This is a simple game of roll the dice , travel the board , beat the monster , and gather the treasure . It is not a game so complicated that only hard core gamers can enjoy it . There is little head to head conflict between characters unless you go out of your way to make it so . That does not take away from the fun to be had.Luck may be more important than strategy with this game , but that is half the fun ! Newbies may have just as much of a chance to win as experienced players do . So if you are looking for a game with hard thought , long term strategy , this is NOT it . This is a fun family style game of simple adventure.This Edition is excellent . The board is VERY high quality and should last a lifetime . The cards are of a decent stock and do not seem to be the type that will fray at the edges after repeated shuffles and handling . This makes the game worth the price they ask.I have only 2 problems with this game : First , after repeated playings , you may find there may not be enough variation in the adventure card deck . It gets to be old hat . This is easily solved by buying one or more of the expansions to add a greater variety . I bought the Reaper , Dungeon , Frost March and Highlands expansions and love them all ! They are ALL Quality products ! My second problem is the game time listed in the rules says 60-90 minutes . 90 Minutes is possible , but this game can take several hours to complete depending on luck and the aggressiveness of the players . I have never seen a game go only 60 minutes . This is not an issue to me as when I set down with my friends to play Talisman , I plan to make an evening of it .	1
For players who like a meaty game , Talisman will give you hours of fun time . A typical game can last over two hours and the rules are more complicated than Monopoly but it is n't hard to master . For a modest investment in learning the game , you can have many afternoons and evenings of fun with kids age 10 and up , great for adults getting together for a game night as well . We play with all adults , mixed kids and adults , and all games are fun.The large number of cards and races make for varied reply and the available expansions are well worth addeding for new races , cards and regions . There is a random component to the game but the focus is more on steady advancement of your character which favors good play over luck.For those who play RPGs , this game could be considered `` D & D ; lite '' , a good way to get a fantasy gaming fix in when you ca n't get your regular group together.Materials are sturdy and the game holds up to lots of use .	1
The Talisman 4th edition update adds a few features and some minor tweaks to a first rate game in preparation for a series of updates based on the newly released version ofTalismanthis will make your older ( 2007 version ) compatible with all new releases from this point on.Minor aesthetic changes including the design on the back of the cards , some card art , ( my constantly drawing son gives it a thumbs up ) and the cardboard figures are replaced by plastic figures which if painted can be kinda cool . There is nothing that prevents the use of the plastic standups if they are preferred and should be retained in your set in case you lose any of the figures.The biggest change is the concept of `` fate '' as an attribute . Each character gets a Fate value along with his others . These are basically re-rolls that can be used to re-roll a single die OF YOUR OWN . It adds a twist to the game and will speed it up.There are also modifications to the board , On the Desert squares you still lose a life but you also draw a card . Other minor modification allow you to acquire fate tokens.If these are a prelude to a new release of Talisman City then this will be worth your while . Note that this update is only required if you ownTalisman The Magical Quest Game ( Newest Version 2007 ) however if you like the game the way it is and do n't plan on using any future updates then you can live without it . The game seems just as good either way .	1
Beatiful and very fun fantasy adventure . A lot of luck plays into this game but strategy is important . Most fun our gaming group has had in a long time . I 'm already buying expansions . Must buy .	1
The board game `` Talisman '' has a well-deserved reputation as one of the best fantasy board games ever made . I have been a die hard fan ever since picking up the Second Edition boxset back in the late 1980s , and I could n't even imagine how many hours I have spent vying for the Crown of Command . I still have all of the Second Edition expansions , from the Dungeon and City up to the Timescape and Dragons , including the cut-out special characters from Games Workshop 's `` White Dwarf '' magazine.Because I love the original so much , ( I ignored the Third Edition , which tried to updated things to make the game more in-line with RPGs including things like `` Experience Points '' and connecting Talisman even further to the Games Workshop `` Warhammer Universe . '' ) it took me awhile to give this Fourth Edition of `` Talisman '' a try . I finally gave it a chance at a local gaming convention and was hooked again.This Fourth Edition takes a basic `` If it ai n't broke , do n't fix it '' approach to this classic boardgame , keeping the Second Edition essentially intact but introducing some of the better fixes from the Third Edition . The board itself is identical , although enlarged and with updated artwork . The card text is almost unchanged ( including characters who `` plod off to the discard pile '' ) although none of the original art was retained.Probably the most notable change was making `` Life '' a variable starting number , just like Strength and Craft . Some of the characters start with five ( Warrior ) or even six ( Troll ) life instead of the standard four . The Prophetess , one of the most powerful characters in the Second Edition , has been de-powered a bit . She can now draw one card , and then chose to either keep that card or discard it and draw another , which she must encounter . That was a nice edition as in the old version The Prophetess was so powerful she was boring to play . An additional element called `` fate counters '' has been added which allow for the re-rolling of a single die if you pay a counter . Craft-defeated monsters can also be cashed-in now in the same way as Strength-defeated monsters.Fantasy Flight games has done a tremendous job with the production values of this version of `` Talisman . '' Aside from the updated artwork , the counters are all hard-plastic with the Strength , Craft and Life counters being colored cones that come in 1-count and 5-count versions . The cards are on laminated cardstock which will last through repeated shuffling and drink-spilling . Really , everything has gone through a major upgrade.If I had any disappointments with this Fourth Edition they are minor . The game board itself is too huge , taking up my entire kitchen table , which means that when I pick up any future expansions ( of which I hope there will be many afterReaper , The DungeonandFrostmarch ) I will have to move to the floor in order to have a space large enough to play.I also would have appreciated it if Fantasy Flight had balanced out the gender ration of characters when commissioning the new artwork . This was something I would n't have noticed except when I was playing with my wife she wanted to play a female character and all that was available was The Sorceress and The Prophetess . Several characters , like the Assassin , the Thief , the Warrior , the Elf , etc ... could have easily been made female in the artwork without changing the game-play in any way.I have great hopes for this new Fourth Edition of `` Talisman , '' and hope that great things are forth coming . I would love to see some old favorites appear , like the `` Champion of Chaos '' and the `` Horrible Black Void , '' along with some new ideas and expansions .	1
Cosmic Encounter : 3-5 Players , Ages 10+ , Average Play Time = 60-90 MinutesThe first thing I noticed about this game was the art style and the visuals ... I do n't have enough thumbs to clearly express how pleased I am by the components . The color schemes are very sharp and the overall feel of the game fits nicely with a sci-fiesque theme.This game is chaotic , but refreshing all at the same time . I appreciate the functionality of the destiny deck , which prevents bully like behavior and from players being singled out . I played this game with three other kids , all between eleven and sixteen years of age ... and you parents out there know how tough it can be to play a competitive game with kids who are constantly seeking to team up against someone else . I felt that the addition of the destiny deck helped to eliminate this tendency well . Sure , the kids could regularly ally themselves with a particular attacker or defender , but their four ships often were n't enough to turn the tides of battle.I have to admit that I did n't play as strategically as I could have , now that I think about it . More often than not , I was out of attack/defense numbered cards and sometimes had two or three negotiate cards in my hand . When the kids saw me only attacking with one ship , they caught on that I was playing a negotiate card . Next time , I think I 'll try attacking with a number card but only use one or two ships , just to keep the kids guessing.The game has a lot of replayability , seeing as how there are fifty races available . Since each one has its own unique power ( s ) , and since two flare cards are randomly dealt to each player in the beginning , the result is often a combination of aliens that players have never seen before . They might have played the zombie alien before , but have they played it against , say , the anti-matter alien ? Each alien you come up against requires a little bit of strategy in terms of how you approach them.Social interaction is also a big factor , and ends up being a positive one . I say that because players will each be trying to psych the other out in regards to what attack / defense card they are going to play , as well as take into account the allies that may or may not be helping them . To be funny ( and it was ) , the kids ' cousin asked for help defending a planet that I was attacking , to which Vinnie Jr and Anthony Jr came to his aid . He ended up playing a negotiate card , which wiped out his own ships and those of his allies for compensation . We all had a laugh , but needless to say , no one came to his aid again.In regards to a learning curve , I see myself needing a few playthrus to get used to how the rules come together . There 's a possibility that other , new players may have the same experience . Do n't be discouraged ... just do your best and have fun . The high replayability factor will help keep the game fresh while you work out the rules and the perfect system . After a few more playthrus , I intend to add the yellow race cards and technology to the game , just to see how that all works out . There are also other variants included in the manual to try out ... the short game variant , for example , looks appealing for a number of reasons.I admit that we did n't exactly play perfectly our first time through . We were all still learning the rules and getting used to where and when to use our specific alien powers that we often forgot to allow a successful attacker the chance to attack again . When the defender negotiated , we forgot that the loser can pick a card from the attacker 's hand rather than the deck , as we were doing . To be fair , we were playing to have fun , so I just chalked it up to a learning experience and moved on . That 's the beauty of playing games ... they are meant to be fun ... and rules can be forgotten or adjusted as need be so as long as the play experience is overall positive.Overall , I highly recommend `` Cosmic Encounter . '' It 's a game that I 'm glad I added to my collection .	1
Cosmic Encounter is one of those games that you can sit and play 4 or 5 games in a couple hours . It 's fairly random so it 's unlikely that you 'll see the same aliens or things happen each game . It 's fun to play and a good game to introduce to people new to board games . It has a couple issues that keep it from being great.Basic Play - Each player gets 20 ships , 5 home planets , a starting hand of 8 cards and gets to pick from one of two random aliens . A player draws a card from the destiny deck ( this tells you who you will be attacking . ) He attacks with 1-4 ships . The attacking player and defending player choose who they would like to invite to be their allies for the battle . The other players then choose to ally with the attacking player , defending player or neither . Players who ally with the attacker get to land on the planet if they win . Players who ally with the defender get to take ships back from the warp ( where destroyed ships go ) or take cards from the deck if their side wins . After alliances are made , the attacker and defender place an encounter card face down . The encounter card will be either an attack value ( which adds to their total of ships ) or a negotiate . If both players play an attack card , whichever side has the highest total of ships wins . If one person plays an attack card and the other a negotiate , whoever played the attack card automatically wins . The player who played the negotiate gets to steal cards from the other player . If both of them play a negotiate , the two players can choose to swap planets or cards . If they fail to reach a deal , they both lose three ships . That 's pretty much it . The first player ( s ) to get their ships on 5 enemy planets win the game . It is possible for every player but one to win the game simultaneously.Components - You get a lot of nice components with the game . The ships are solid and stack-able . There is no board for the game . The planets look alright and hold your ships well enough . The warp has enough room to hold all destroyed ships and has a score tracker so you can see how close each player is to victory . The aliens are printed on large cards and look really good . The actual playing cards are somewhat below par , they 'll get beat up pretty quick and sometimes stick together . With that said , they are durable enough that they wo n't become unusable . The rulebook is generally well written and easy to get through . The insert for the game is the terrible Fantasy Flight standard one that is just awful . It will not hold everything properly so you 're better off just trashing it.Length - The game usually only takes 25 - 45 minutes with 5 players once you know how to play.Re-playability - There is a lot of re-playability in the game due to the large number of aliens . There are 60 total aliens in the base game , each divided into different colors , green for newbies , yellow for players who have played a couple times and red for more advanced powers . Each alien breaks the rules in some way which makes the game interesting , especially seeing aliens who counteract one another . The Mind is an alien who is able to look at other players hands . The Parasite is an alien who can ally himself with any player at any time no matter what they want . The Dictator goes through the destiny deck and chooses who other players will attack.Luck - The main luck in this game will come from the cards you draw . The destiny deck will determine who you will attack . There are not a lot of powerful cards in the main deck . If you get a bad starting hand with a bunch of low attack cards or a bunch of negotiates , you could be in for a rough game.Interaction - The game is about attacking each other to get planets . Players will constantly be inviting you to help them attack or defend . There are cards you can play when it is not your turn that can affect the other players . You will almost always be interacting in some way throughout the game on everyone 's turn.Thoughts Pro - A lot of good things . The game is fast , very little down time , it 's usually fun , it 's easy to learn , there is plenty of strategy and a lot of choices in aliens to keep things interesting . The alien flare cards ( which offer a super power if you have your own alien flare card or a wild power if you 're some other alien ) offer a lot of variety in things you can do . Artifact cards allow you to do things like cancel a player 's alien power for a turn or to cancel a used flare card.Thoughts Con - There are 2 large issues that keep this game from being considered great or perfect to me . The largest and most annoying issue is that the beginning and the end game are often lackluster . This is disappointing since the endgame should be the best part . The problem that causes this is that there are a lot of negotiate cards in the deck . Each player will probably start off with about 2 on average and there have been plenty of games where I 've started with 3-5 . The start game usually begins with players just negotiating with each other for planets . You 'll often see players boosting each other to the top of the score sheet just negotiating . There have been several games where one of the victors never even won a planet in battle . The game often ends like this as well , with both players playing a negotiate and sharing a joint win . The worst part is that there is almost no way to stop players from doing this . There is only one card in the 100+ card deck that stops a successful negotiation . If one of the two players negotiating has that card or it was played earlier in the game , than there 's no stopping it . The game desperately needs at least 5 more of these cards , that would fix this awful issue . It is incredibly boring to sit back and watch two players negotiate for a victory.The second issue I have is really more of an issue for me . There will often be 3-4 players tied at 4 planets each . These players will usually ally together to get a joint 3-4 player victory and that just is n't really fun to me . It 's not interesting to watch 12-16 ships attack a planet with 1 or 0 ships on it ( not to mention all those alien abilities , artifacts , flares , and re-enforcement cards they can use ) . The only chance the other player has is having some obscene power or one of the 30 or 40 attack value cards . It 's gotten to the point where joint victories are so boring that I absolutely refuse to win with another player . I will ally with the defender even if I 'm at 4 planets and I was invited to help attack . If I happen to get stuck in a negotiation with another player while tied at 4 planets , I 'll refuse to make a deal that involves anything other than card swapping . I rarely win because alliances ( and negotiation victories ) are so powerful in this game but it 's much more satisfying when I do actually pull it out.Final Thoughts - I really like this game . The 60 aliens make it unlikely that you 'll play the same alien more than once within 10 games . Your strategy will often revolve around whichever alien you chose at the start . It 's quick , so you can usually get 3-4 games in within a 2 hour span . It 's easy to teach new players . It 's a game that I 'll sit down and play anytime it comes out but I 'm usually satisfied with just 1 or 2 games because of the the tediousness of how most games end . It can sometimes be awful to play if you got a terrible starting hand . I wish there were a lot less negotiate cards or way more quash cards to stop successful negotiations . I think they should also reduce the number of players who can win at once down to 2 . If it were n't for those two issues , I 'd easily rate this game a 9 or a 10 . As it is , I 'd rate it an 8/10 .	1
I got this game and tried it out on my family . They immediately loved it , even the family members who I 'm usually hard-pressed to get to play . I bought most of the expansions that go with it that increase it from a max of 6 to 8 players . The game mechanics are very simple to teach . You will never play the same game twice with all the alien races you can be in the game and each of their own skills and abilities really change the strategy and game play of each game you play . I ca n't say enough good things about this game and I highly recommend it to anyone ! This game has been around a long time and its gotten better with age seems like .	1
Great Game . If you like bluffing , like poker , or confrontation games like Risk or Axis and Allies , this game is at the top of the class . The main rule is that your alien character somehow circumvents and or otherwise breaks a rule or rules in the game . The rules and the way the game plays allows for interesting player interaction.If you are looking for a game to get for someone that likes the bluffing and ante aspect of Poker then you will like this game . Give it a try it 's a classic and it 's worth every penny .	1
I 've been playing Cosmic since my teenage years . I 'm now in my 40s and have introduced my own teenage children to the game . There are many version of the game of varying quality and with slightly different rules . This version is one of the best , probably second only to the long out of print and incredibly expensive Eon version.This is the game that inspired Magic the Gathering . The goal of the game is to establish colonies in other players ' star systems . It is very easy to learn how to play , one practice game lasting 15 minutes is usually all it takes . What makes the game brilliant is the alien powers , each of which allows you to break one of the rules of the game . The result is a game that is different every time you play . This is a social game that requires lots of interaction between players . Social skills are just as important as strategy . Rarely can a player bully his way to a win . Teens can play with other teens . Parents can play with their children . Most amazingly , parents can play with their teenage children and their children 's teenage friends . There are not many games where that can happen.This version is scaleable . Players may chose to play one of the basic rule sets or add some or all of the various expansion sets that are included . These add to the complexity of the game.I often buy this game as a gift for others in an attempt to spread the word about this most amazing game .	1
So many player powers in the base game that you could play a different alien each time . It would take you a long time before you played the same alien twice . A good serious board game that anyone can like .	1
I 've only been into board/card games for the past 3 years or so . I got started with Citadels , Castle Panic , and A Game of Thrones 2nd Edition . My expanding library of games now includes Cosmic Encounter . Tom Vasel gets the credit for this purchase because his annual Youtube Top 100 Bordgames of All Time lists consistently feature this as his number one game.WOW ! ! ! I am so glad I followed his advise . I ca n't say it 's for everybody , but these are the reasons that I have fallen in love with it.1 ) It supports 3 - 5 players out of the box , and it features 3 - 8 players with the first three expansions . That 's a good range in my book.2 ) Without the four current expansions ( a fifth is on the way ) , there are 50 alien races , each with their own unique power , available for each player to choose from . There are so many different combinations that each game will be different from the last . ( if you have all four current expansions , there are 135 aliens to choose from for a truly immense variety of combinations ) .3 ) The gameplay is amazing ! Long story short . . . each person 's turn is an attack against another player . During each battle , both sides can ask for allies from the other players . Anybody involved in the & # 34 ; encounter & # 34 ; sends up to four of their 20 ships ( 4 start out on each of your 5 planets at the beginning of the game ) into the battle . The main players in the battle then reveal an encounter card and you see who wins . Negotiate cards or attack cards can be played , both offering different effects on the outcome of the battle . Once somebody attains their 5th foreign colony outside of their home system , that ( those ) player ( s ) win ( s ) the game . Those are the basics , but the variety of powers , extra cards ( artifacts , flares , etc . ) , and other variants ( Tech , Secret Powers ) keep the game interesting at all times . I have never played a game that has so many epic moments ! 4 ) Quality of the pieces and cards ? Exceptional . The alien sheets are large and sturdy with excellent artwork . Your ships ( UFO 's ) are easily stacked on each other to save space , and are made of quality plastic . The cards are great quality , and the cardboard pieces are very sturdy like any other Fantasy Flight Games Production.5 ) Expansions add even more to the game as you want more complexity . You get new game variants/options , more player colors , and more aliens.All I can say is that if you like games that cut to the chase , put you in the heat of moment , have almost no downtime between turns ( since everybody can participate in EVERY encounter ) , with unique powers for each player , featuring epic moments that you ca n't even imagine until you see them for yourself , with a play time of around 1 - 2 hours , then this game is for you . It 's the only game I 've ever played where somebody won ( tied with 3 other players ) without it ever getting around to his turn . And yet I 've played games where it drags on for a very long time and power shifts regularly . You never know what to expect when playing a game of Cosmic Encounter , but you can be assured that it will be a blast !	1
These are the perfect size for Love Letter and Resistance . I like how slick they are and make shuffling very easy . I had several left over so I decided to sleeve Saboteur role and goal cards . These are a bit too big for Saboteur , but I wanted to protect the goal cards asap before the gold card got any kind of marking to spot easily .	1
These are the first sleeves I 've ever used . I wanted to protect the cards in Love Letter , and these worked perfectly .	1
I needed to sleeve my expansion cards for a board game . These are thicker and clearer than the Mayfair games sleeves I got with my base game . The cards slide in easily . The size is perfect .	1
Kingsburg is a worker placement board game designed by Andrea Chiarvesio and Luca Iennaco . The game is published in the United States by Fantasy Flight Games . For its price , quality and game play : Kingsburg is the best gateway game on the market.Players strive to score the most victory points . You score victory points mostly by building . In order to make buildings , players must have resources : gold , ore and wood . Buildings give players several benefits such as bonuses to battle , extra resources , and manipulation of dice rolls.Players have a town mat in front of them . This shows which buildings they have built . The buildings on the far left are entry level . To make buildings , you must have both the appropriate resources and have built all the other buildings to left of the desired building . Thus , long term strategy is required when deciding which building paths a player will take.Players acquire resources during the productive seasons ( spring , summer and fall ) . There are 8 phases in the game of which 3 are productive seasons . Players roll three dice ( 6-sided dice ) . Players play one or more dice onto the game board . The game board has 18 spaces numbered from 1 to 18 -- representing all the advisors from the Jester ( 1 ) to the King ( 18 ) . To influence an advisor ( and receive the bonus thereto ) , a player must place dice with the correct total onto that advisor 's space . Thus , to influence the Jester , a player must place a die with a `` 1 '' onto that space . If you did n't roll a `` 1 '' , you can not influence the Jester . Players can place multiple dice onto an advisor in order to influence the more powerful advisors ; again the total of the dice must equal the advisor 's value.Some advisors give victory points ( the Jester and the Queen ) ; some give soldiers ( the Sergeant , Captain and King ) and most give resources . If a player influences an advisor , no other player may influence that advisor during that season . So there is an important strategy to where to place your dice.There are 5 years ( 8 phases each ) in the game . During the 8th phase of each year , there is a battle . Players must defend the kingdom from the kingdom 's enemies ( goblins , orcs , barbarians , etc ) . If the player 's battle total from soldiers , buildings and the king 's aid is greater than the enemy 's total , the player is successful , else the enemy wins . It is possible ( and quite probable ) that some players will be successful while others will be unsuccessful . Those who are unsuccessful are sacked by the enemy , losing the appropriate buildings or resouces listed on the enemy card . Those who are successful gain the booty listed on the enemy card . After 5 years , the game ends and the player with the highest victory point wins.Kingsburg is easy to learn for non-gamers . The iconography is intuitive which aids to its gateway nature . There is a great deal of replayability in Kingsburg also . There are plenty of ways to win.The only problem with Kingsburg is the way the battles are handled . The king 's aid is a die roll . This eliminates so much strategy that it renders this aspect of the game meaningless . The expansion solves this problem luckily.If you want a fairly cheap game with great replayability and that 's also the best gateway game on the market , I highly recommend Kingsburg . If you like Kingsburg but think something is missing , I also suggest picking up the expansion.The expansion includes 7 rows of buildings instead of 5 in the base game . Also , there are overlays for these buildings which means there is even more variety . The expansion also solves the issues with the winter battle . Instead of rolling a die for the king 's aid , players have tiles numbered from 0 to 4 . They play a tile with the appropriate amount of aid from the king that they want . This elegantly solves the only real issue I have with the game . The expansion includes governor cards which give players benefits throughout the game . And there are random event cards . The expansion additives can be included in your games a la carte so you can sweeten the game to your gaming taste . This expansion is a nice addition to an already fine game .	1
If you enjoyed this dice-infused worker placement game , this expansion adds five new & # 34 ; modules & # 34 ; to mix in to your base game . Larger building boards , alternate building rows , unique roles , yearly condition cards , and non-random winter army chips make this game customizable and ensures a varied game each time . The new buildings and cards especially help keep the game fresh once you find all the different strategies in the base game . Notably there is no board extension , no more dice , and no more monster cards but that does n't hurt the expansion at all .	1
In a game already full of decisions this expansion just adds more , but I love it ! There is a Dice Tower review on YouTube about Kingsburg and and this expansion that helped me to make the decision to buy the game and later the expansion.I agree with most of the reviews I have seen . All of the added components are great except the military tokens . I guess if everyone playing agrees to use them then it 's ok , but you are trading 1-6 every year to 0-4 and you can only have each number once . This means that if you happen to chose the one 4 you have on the first year then you are probably going to loose the battle in the 4th and 5th year . How is that fun ? I also disagree with the people that say that this expansion is essential . I like it , but I licked the game just fine without it . Also I think it would have been cool if they had added some monsters , but they didn't.Get this after you have played the base game at least 5 or 6 times .	1
`` To Forge A Realm '' is pretty typical of other expansions , in that it gives you new tokens and cards that you can either swap out or mix in with the original game components . Sometimes this does n't really make for a new gaming experience or strategy , but does bring some novelty to a game you 've already played several times ( and probably enjoy , otherwise there 's no sense in buying an expansion ) .There 's a little of both with this one : -Soldier Tokens definitely make the winter battles more significant , so you have to alter strategy a bit from the normal rules to avoid losing buildings or victory points . I think this is good , and I really like the addition.-New building sheets offer more variety , but do n't really change the strategy if everyone is using the same sheets.-New building layover strips are GREAT , with or without the new building sheets , because now players have options for buildings not available to other players , which provides different ways to win.-Governor Cards offer a great deal of variety to many facets of the game , and they seem well balanced after several plays . In one game , I took a Noble to start the game with 6 victory points , but still ended up losing to a player whose Miner gave an extra gold at the end of each productive season.-Event Cards affect everyone the same way , so I did n't find these as enjoyable as other elements of this expansion that are unique to individual players.Since each of these additions are modular , you can use only the ones you like . Even though I really only like 3 of the 5 , Kingsburg is one of my favorite games , and if you enjoy it too , then I recommend you pick up `` To Forge A Realm '' as well .	1
I might as well come right out with it- reviewing expansion sets is rough ! Of course this is n't to suggest it 's any harder to tell if an expansion is fun to play , easy to grasp , or any other factor used to rate a game , but where things get a little fuzzy is in the specific area of determining how much of an expansion 's value stems from the base game it expands upon or whether or not it adds to or takes away from the charm of the original . In the case of Kingsburg , it was quite a risk going in simply because the base game is a staple among my collection and I am , apparently , a subscriber to the theory that things unbroken need not be fixed.Fortunately such concerns for `` To Forge a Realm '' proved unfounded after only a few moments of play . While packaged and labeled an expansion set , To Forge a Realm is in fact five individual modules that can be used separately or in conjunction to alter some of the strengths and weaknesses of the base game , while tossing in a healthy dose of variety for good measure.Consisting of 5 new province sheets , 14 alternative building rows , 24 new governor cards , 29 destiny cards , and 30 soldier tokens , the set appears fairly modest upon initial inspection . However , as anyone who has played the base game can attest , it 's what is done with these components that determines the level of impact.In this case the first module involves simply kicking the original player-province sheets to the curb ( or leaving them in the box as the case may be ) in favor of using the new sheets , which include two entirely new rows of building options to tempt you out of your supplies . The new sheets still go four-across ( one for each season + the fifth and final let 's you build from any of them ) , the new sheets run seven structures deep and include all sorts of cool structures from a quarry that allows you to trade a stone for 3 gold pieces to a recruiting center that let 's you treat the +2 dice tokens as if they were resources.The second module actually works in conjunction with the first one ( if you choose to use it ) and adds a bit of randomness to the mix . Here we have 14 single-row strips of buildings different from those on the new player province sheet . The rules tell you to lay them out face down and have players pick either one or two with which to slide over their province sheet before playing . What this does is arranges it so that not everyone 's building options are the same . Just like with the first module , this one presents some really cool buildings that grant all sorts of new abilities and bonuses/punishments.The third module comes in the form of the newly added governor cards . These babies are chosen at random and one goes into the player 's inventory . The governor he ends up with can be used throughout the game for all sorts of new twists . Since there are 24 of them in total , I can not possibly highlight them all here but a few examples include the sculptor who grants his player a stone piece at the end of each year and the ability to spend stones as if they were gold pieces . The schemer gives his player a victory point every time he influences an advisor on the game board # 14 or higher . The thief lets you start the game with 4 gold pieces but at the cost of 3 victory points and the Mercenary automatically adds +2 to your battle ranking . This addition is a great idea and good fun in action.The fourth module is the all-new feature of destiny cards . A card is drawn from this deck at the beginning of each in-game year and everyone playing has to adhere to its effect . It can reward everyone like in the following example : `` A new forest is grown , each player rolls a die at the beginning of each productive season , roll a 4 or higher and you earn a wood piece '' . Or they could punish everyone : `` The King is sick , players can no longer influence the king ( # 18 ) on the board this year . Pull the card twice and the king dies- Game Over . `` Again , this module represents a fantastic little addition that adds a nice bit of randomness to the game.The fifth and final module addresses those players who felt it was a bit too easy to win the battles at the end of winter what with the king 's aid coming in the form of a roll of the white die and all . Rather than getting that roll to determine how many reinforcements can be added to your battle rating , this module introduces soldier tokens . Each player gets a 0 , 1 , 1 , 2 , 3 , & 4 token at the beginning of the game . Each one can only be used once and it is this token 's value that determines how many reinforcements they earn per given battle . I protested this one early on when , for the first time , I lost a battle to the orcs and had to destroy one of my precious buildings but my tendency to be a sore loser aside , this is a much more balanced system that forces players into taking the annual battles more seriously.In all , To Forge a Realm does what I would have thought impossible right up until the moments prior to playing it : It improves upon the already outstanding formula that is Kingsburg . The fact that it is broken down into 5 separate modules works very well in allowing players the ability to integrate the new features into play at their own pace . Plus mixing and matching modules only extends the game 's replay value exponentially . I may even be so bold as to say that it 's the first two modules that really cover the cost of admission as introducing dozens of new buildings to purchase just pumps the in-game possibilities through the roof.This expansion succeeds because it wisely does not tamper with any of the fundamental elements that make Kingsburg such a joy to play but rather simply enhances the aspects that do work by providing players with more options.I would like to say that Fantasy Flight should include this kit in future editions of Kingsburg but fear that it may actually overload beginner players with too many options and variations . As it stands , Kingsburg is a very enjoyable experience on its own and players should go in with the confidence in knowing that the moment things start to get a little stale , To Forge a Realm is there to completely refresh the excitement .	1
To Forge a Realm has the unenviable task of taking a mediocre game and turning it into something great . The bad news is that it falls short of achieving greatness . The GOOD news is that it does transform the game from a two-dimensional , uninvolving exercise in unexceptionalism and breathes much needed life into it , making it a lot more palatable.I had played ( and enjoyed ) Kingsburg once before buying the base game . What I did n't realize was that the version I played included many of the items in `` To Forge a Realm '' . Needless to say , I was quite disappointed that the base game did not include these components . A nice feature is that each of the facets of this expansion are independent , and can be included ( or left out ) as you see fit.Enlarged player sheets - The original sheets had 20 buildings , these contain an extra two rows , so they have 28 buildings . The bottom line is that instead of only having 5 possible buildings to choose to build , there are now 7 possibilities . That 's a big step in the right direction.Replacement Rows - Used in conjunction with the enlarged sheets , you may blindly take one or two of these rows and place them over the rows on your sheet . Not only does this vary the buildings that are available , but each player 's sheet is no longer identical to all the others.Deck of Governor cards - Allows each player to play as a different character , each with different benefits . Some people also call this their ` personal advisor ' . Either way , this once again gives individuality to each player ( which was sorely needed ) ! Event Deck - This deck of cards is shuffled and at the beginning of each year a new card is turned over with instructions that pertain only to the coming year . These cards affect all players . Some cards are pleasant , some are not , but it adds another small dimension to the game.Reinforcement tokens ( one set per player ) , each year , instead of the King 's reinforcements being determined by a die roll , players can choose one of six tokens requesting a number of reinforcements , Each token may be used only once . One token will remain at the end of the game , which gets added to the players score.Of these components , I ALWAYS use the enlarged sheets , USUALLY use the two decks and the replacement rows ( I wo n't use them when teaching new players ) , and JUST STARTED using the reinforcement tokens ( for some reason I did n't think the reinforcements would help the game very much , but I actually enjoy them a lot ) .My advice is that if you have Kingsburg already , this expansion is a must-have . I do n't think Kingsburg would ever hit my table these days if I did n't have this . If you have n't gotten Kingsburg yet , realize that it 's possible that at some point , you 'll be faced with the decision to either buy the `` To Forge a Realm '' expansion or let the base game gather dust on your game shelf .	1
As has been mentioned by several reviewers the game is extremely difficult to win . I have only played it solo , but my win/loss percentage seems to be as low as it is for most players . Also , many have stated the rule book simply does n't explain the rules very well . It would have helped a lot if they went thru an example of the initial game play . I recommend the add on set that includes additional Space Marines , because some of their special abilities are better than those of the Space Marines in the base pack . For instance , Chaplain Raziel in the addition pack has this as an Attack card - `` When Chaplain Raziel attacks a swarm in his position , the defending swarm may not attack this turn . '' Very powerful card to play . Another nice Attack card - `` Instead of attacking with Brother Adron , you may roll a combat die . Slay up to 3 Genestealers from a single swarm up to this number of positions away ( regardless of facing ) . If you roll a '0 , ' there is no effect . '' As I recall both of these cards came from the add on pack . With this game you need all the help you can get . And , I must say , for those few times that you win it is very rewarding .	1
For those of you who are not familiar with the Warhammer 40K universe , this light tactical card game is still a lot of fun . It has a unique mechanic in that each card in the layout has a facing and a position which impacts combat . A large amount of luck is required ( 1 die comes with the game for combat resolution ) to win this game but you can mitigate it with some tactical card playing decisions.Good quality to the cards and does n't require sleeves . Scales well from 1-6 players and has a quick setup and tear down time . Expansions can be bought online or directly from FFG but having a varied amount of players and playing different squads helps with the replay value .	1
Anyone who knows warhammer 40k universe , is bound to agree that it 's a very grime future . It 's about the Adeptus Astartes and their fellow legions of Imperial troops , countless planetary defense forces and the Inquisition fighting against the ever present aliens , tyranids , and the chaos forces . This card game captures that future with it 's almost impossible to win game mechanics . But sometimes you do beat the enemy , but at a heavy cost ... ... Well about the game itself , the cards are of good quality and the tokens too . Rule book is ok . But there are some gaps ... . Certain card details are difficult to interpret , so had to check out the fantasy flight games ' website for its board game forums . Now all seems to be good.But I love this game , since I am a big fan of the warhammer 40k universe . Wish they will make a card game for the Horus Heresy era too . Sorry I am not a miniature game fan .	1
This is a pretty good game . Randomization keeps things interesting and sometimes makes the game harder . The strategy is to shoot the enemy while moving through the ship . Utilizing the various terrain can help a lot . I bought a few expansion packs for this game and they make it even more fun.Overall , it is a decent game to play . Wear and tear on the cards can get old , though . Luckily , most of the cards sit on the table as you play . Only a few cards are in your 'hand'.This is a challenging yet fun game to play .	1
Nice addition to an already excellent remake of Talisman . Definitely suggested buy.Only con is the price vs what you get . $ 15 would be a good price point for this product , not $ 23 .	1
Ok. if you have seen my other reviews then you know I have a soft spot in my heart ( head ? ) for Talisman . This Expansion is a step in the right direction . There are numeorus new Adventure , Warlock Quest , and Spell cards . As usual the card stock is high quality with a high durability and they feature very nice artwork.There is a great idea explored here that was first done in the 80 's version of Talisman . The Alternate ending card . Only , my problem is , there are only three included in this expansion . One of them is the 'Warlock 's Quest ' option , which is not a `` hidden '' ending at all , it must be agreed upon by all players in advance . So that means if you are going to try a hidden Alternate ending there are really only 2 it could be ; the 'Frost Queen ' , and the Crown and 'Scepter of Command ' . Not a lot of variety there . They should have included the basic 'Crown of Command ' card , or the old 'Sucked into the Void ' at least ! There are two alternate ending cards available on the Fantasy Flight web site , but the players will know when the home made cards are being used . Ugh . This is a disappointment , and the reason I gave the expansion ony 4 stars . Such a great idea that does not live up to it 's potential . If there were say 5 alternate endings ( 6 with Warlock quest ) this expansion would have been perfect ! Other than that my only complaint is the cost of this expansion . For an expansion of cards and characters only , even with new rules for the end game , I would expect a maximum price of $ 20 . Not the case here . Still the expansion does add variety to the basic Talisman game , and for that I give it a thumbs up .	1
This is one of the small expansions to Talisman but a very nice one.The expansion introduces : * the necromancer , an evil master of spirits who can make them fight on his side* the warlock a strong caster with a minor advantage on warlock quests* the ogre chieftan , a brute who can avoid fighting monster and make defeated ones fight on his side* the leprechaun who does n't look like much but his ability to get gold in woods and teleport to any space in a region on a move roll of `` 6 '' is quite powerfulAll four of these races are some of the popular races in our game group.The warlock quest cards make warlock quests much more interesting . It 's a very colorful and entertaining new dimension to the game.The two new victory conditions are decent . The Ice Queen one is similar to several others in the various expansions . The warlock quest one is quite fun and makes for a very different type of game.And , of course , there are many more spells and adventure cards . It 's an excellent addition to the game and well worth adding .	1
The Lord of the Rings board game is , amongst my group of friends , something of a classic . It 's a difficult , engaging , and fun board game for a group , though it is not without its flaws . It carries the art style of the classis Tolkien books and is not related to the movies ( though of course the plot is the same ) .Gameplay : Each of the players ( up to 5 ) plays one of the hobbits from the books ( including Fatty Bolger , who is included in the game even though he was left out of the recent movies ) . The goal is for the hobbits to trek the one ring to Mt . Doom before Sauron can claim it as his own . To do so , players will need to work together to draw and play cards allowing them to move through each section of the story successfully . While doing so , they will often draw cards or run into scenarios in which Sauron will draw closer to victory . There is a bit of luck and a good deal of strategy involved.Difficulty : This is one of those games that is going to take a while to fully learn . After a round or two , most people will have gotten the rules for the most part , and wo n't have to consult the rulebook as often . It will , however , still require some attention to detail to master . Also , the game ( Sauron ) usually seems to win . In my book , that 's a plus since it makes the rare wins all the more meaningful.Time : I would say that a game usually takes about an hour , though this can vary a bit depending on the number of players and their level of familiarty with the game.The Game itself : The game itself has some really lovely boards with full-color drawings of Middle Earth . The cards are also quite nice . The pieces for the hobbits themselves are a bit lackluster , but everything is pretty sturdy , and you should n't have any problem keeping this game for quite a while.In conclusion , I think this game is a great buy for LOTR fans who enjoy a boardgame experience a little more invovled than the LOTR branded Monopoly and Stratego . In my experience , people tend to really enjoy the game once they pick it up .	1
My husband and I have only played a couple times , but it is definitely harder than Pandemic or House on the Hill ( sic ) .This edition contains slightly different rules than the original release . It is helpful to have both . The other rules can be found at Boardgamegeek .	1
The negative reviews this game has been getting for not being compatible with expansions are not deserved . This game is great and the best co-op board game available 2nd toDays of Wonder Shadows Over Camelot . This game is a remake by Fantasy Flight and is an improvement on the original . If you have to have the old expansions then sure buy the original game but this new verion stands on its own ( I think Fantasy Flight might be working on revised expanions anyway ) . The artwork and design is beautiful ! You really need to strategize , especially before heading into Mordor or you will lose ! Non-gamers and gamers alike will both love this game ! Makes a great companion toThe Hobbit Boardgame . Same artist and game designer on both .	1
Like the novels , this game can come across as quite the endeavour if you plan to finish it.Do not start this game with people who are not ready to play a long game that can be sometimes tedious but also at times very exciting ! When Sauron starts to move , you 'll see why this game is such a challenge to beat.If you 've got time , patience and determination to see it through , you 'll have fun .	1
At first a little overwhelming but my friends and I were able to pick it up pretty easily after the first game . Lots of pvp and replayability it is a must for any fan of GoT and Board games .	1
Good mix of diplomacy and risk . It 's a long game . Players should definitely allow extra time to play their first game as the game is super complex , but really good says my 20-something son for whom I bought the game . Very solid build quality - all of the pieces and components are high quality . For serious gamers - there are no spoilers though if you have n't watched Seasons 2+ , or read the second book , you will meet some new characters .	1
I ca n't say enough good things about this board game . It is the best & # 34 ; war and strategy & # 34 ; board game I have played up to this point . It really feels like the game that Risk should have been , but the Game of Thrones theme tops the cake on this board game . I love how great all the artwork is and how easy it is to make allies and back stab each other in the game . The hidden action mechanic is the best and I have n't seen anything like it before I played this game . Very very very fun and I hope to get in more game time with this one .	1
I got this as a birthday gift for my husband who loves the series and is also a fan of rpg 's . It 's a very involved game that requires a lot of time and participation . But it is fun and my husband absolutely LOVES it .	1
This is fun , especially if you are familiar with the series . Certain gameplay aspects are very creative , and really emulate the backstabbing diplomacy of the series . But it is complicated , and does n't work well with fewer players . Gameplay gets slow and repetitive after a few games .	1
When my 17 y/o asked for this game , I was taken aback by the price and hesitant to place the order . However , he is a huge fan of the Game of Thrones , having read the books and watched the show . So I placed the order and he is THRILLED.This is the highest quality board game I have EVER purchased . That being said , know what you 're getting into before you buy it . This game is not for those with a limited attention span . It comes with a 32-page instruction manual . Several pages are dedicated to identifying the pieces as well as the initial set-up . It is easily the most complicated game our family has ever played . It took nearly 45 minutes to set up the first go round , and takes 3-4 hours to play.If you are an avid fan and have a solid knowledge of the series , you will love it . For the rest of us , it can be quite confusing . But , my son is happy . My husband enjoys it , and my two younger children ( ages 10 1/2 and 12 ) are able to play along with a little help.Do n't let the price tag sway you . If you 're a fan of the series , it 's well worth the price . You wo n't be disappointed .	1
George R. R. Martin 's `` A Song of Ice and Fire '' book series is absolutely wonderful . It succeeds largely by presenting a grand , epic scope of wars and conflict , dragons , and wraiths , but also manages to create interesting characters and tell intimate stories . Other key factors in the books are treachery , intrigue , and betrayal . Fantasy Flight Games ' `` A Game of Thrones : The Board Game '' manages to recreate all of the thrilling adventure of the books , but most importantly offers that same great sense of back-stabbing and double-crossing.Up to six players take on the roles of the book 's great houses , each with their own geographic starting lands on the board . Each player commands units which can then attack other players in an attempt to be the first to capture the most castles . The problem is that with supply caps no one house can become powerful enough to conquer the needed objectives on his own , and so must rely on the help of others to succeed . This is dangerous , however , as someone who appears to be winning can easily face the treason of his friends.Game play resembles that of another great game , Avalon Hill 's classic `` Diplomacy . '' Players place action tokens near their units face down , then reveal them more or less simultaneously . This allows one player to promise another player the support of his military units , only to reveal that he has betrayed him at the critical moment . It is an absolutely wonderful game mechanic that will will either cause the object of your treachery to hate you until the day you die or howl with laughter . ( Seriously , you do n't want to play this game with people who take things like this far too seriously- you will lose friends ) . Other mechanics involve auctions to gain coveted positions in the kingdom , each with their own abilities , and the threat of Wildling attacks from north of the wall . Various other cards allow you to take certain actions each turn in a really interesting manner.All told , `` A Game of Thrones : The Board Game '' is just a thrilling adventure that will provide hours of entertainment with each game . Check it out- after all , `` Winter is Coming ! ''	1
A Game of Throne : The Board Game First Edition has been my favorite game for a couple of years . This game has the best war strategy mechanics out of all the games I have played . The Second Edition just improved upon an already loved game . I wo n't go into depth of how it is played , but I would definitely recommend playing with someone that knows how to play your first time if possible . The rules can be a lot to take in at once , but is definitely worth the learning curve . A highly recommend this game to anyone that enjoys long strategy games . Along with the additions of ports and siege engines , there are a couple minor rule changes with the second edition . So if you are going from first edition to second edition I recommend you do a thorough read through of the rules before playing . Having knowledge of the book is n't needed but definitely adds to gaming experience . I actually decided to read the books after enjoying first edition game so much.The only problem I had was my copy has a warped board , but after contacting Fantasy Flight I found out there was a cutting issues with some of the first prints . They were quick and responsive and are sending me out a new board .	1
A Game of Thrones is an amazing game . . . if you like war/area control board games that require lots of strategy and involve almost 0 luck . It 's a challenging game to play , the rule book is extensive , but the rewards are worth it . You need at least 3-6 players , so it wo n't work as a couple 's game . However , if you have some friends to play with this will be the perfect addition to your game collection.Without going into too many details , here is the basic play of the game:1 ) Turn up event cards that affect the game/round immediately.2 ) Place `` order tokens '' face down next to your armies . All players reveal their orders simultaneously , and based upon turn order each player executes their actions.3 ) Clean up and prepare for the next round.One of my favorite parts of the game is the ability to forge alliances with other players . You can agree to support each other in battle , or plan strategies to outmaneuver players that are in a better position to win the game . Blind bidding is another aspect of this game that I absolutely love . There are three `` Influence Tracks '' that you can bid on at certain points throughout the game that can vastly affect how you play the game . there is also bidding against neutral `` Wildlings '' that can cause some tense situations.One issue I do have with this game is that the six different families do n't seem very balanced . Starting positions and their particular cards ( which influence battle ) seem to favor certain families over others . However , this is where the alliances come in . You have to make sacrifices and work with others if you want to make it through this game . At any given point you never know who 's actually trying to help you.Having never read the books or watched the HBO series , I 'm coming to this game from a purely game loving background . As such , I find this game simply amazing . If you are playing with the right group of people you will be very pleased with the intensity this game offers.Update : 2/6/13 Unfortunately , I have n't had any chances to play with more than 3 players since I got this game . IMO , 4 is the minimum to really make the game interesting , but 6 is definitely the optimum . However , I have played a `` 6 player '' game with my brother where each of us controlled 3 armies each . Although not the perfect way to play , it demonstrated how amazing this game can be . If only I had 5 others who wanted to play with me . . . .Also , there is an available expansion to this game ( A Dance with Dragons is the title ) . It REQUIRES 6 people to play , and it shifts the power greatly . The expansion includes new character cards for each family ( some of these cards have very interesting effects ) , and the army layout is completely different , leaving some armies spread thin with others relatively consolidated . It 's definitely worth a look if you have 6 players that enjoy this game .	1
A Game of Thrones : The Board Game Second Edition is my absolute favorite strategy/war/intrigue board game . It 's combat system relies not at all on luck ( unless you use the optional Tides of War cards ) and focuses more on troop placement and sheer strategy . We played with six houses and had an amazing time.Intrigue : Playing against your friends can be fun , and dangerous . Especially when you start backstabbing everyone in order to climb their bodies to get to that Iron Throne ! Forging alliances , and betraying them will seem commonplace , afterall : When you play the Game of Thrones , you win or you die . We facilitated added secrecy by using cellphones to text each other during the game.Story : I get asked this question a lot : Do you have to read the books to enjoy the game ? Absolutely not . Nor are there an abundance of spoilers built in . It does feel good to do battle over a specific area when you know the significance of it , like King 's Landing ! Material : Solidly constructed , heavy cardboard gameboard . Unit figures are made from plastic . All tokens are made from thick cardboard , and very unlikely to bend . The artwork is beautiful . The only complaint I have is the size/thickness of the game cards . They are a little small and very thin , making them hard to shuffle at times , but I got over this easily.Rules : Is it hard to learn ? Yes and no . These rules are complicated at first , and the book is a beast ; I do n't find it very well organized but I 'm sure some people would disagree . I tried to explain the rules from the book to five other players , but did n't have adequate prep time to figure out the best way to do it . If you are struggling with the rules make everyone in your group search youtube for this video : `` A Game of Thrones : The Board Game ( 2nd Edition ) Complete Tutorial '' yes it 's 20+ minutes , so we ordered a pizza and watched while we ate . At the end of the video , we had a good enough grasp to play and grab the rulebook sparingly for clarification.Play Time : If you know all of the rules , plan on a few hours . I was sure that only having 10 rounds that the game could n't possibly take more than an hour and a half . I was incorrect.Overall : I 'd gladly play this game every weekend , and will absolutely introduce it to many more friends !	1
`` Winter is Coming '' - House StarkWith the Game of Thrones TV show at an all time high , I thought this would be a great time to introduce the A Game of Thrones The Board Game 2nd Ed . to those fans who many not know about it or who or not savvy with the latest rage of board games . A Game of Thrones The Board Game 2nd Ed . is put out by the board game publishing juggernaut Fantasy Flight Games located in Roseville , MN and is based on George R.R . Martins bestselling book series `` A Song of Ice and Fire . `` A Game of Thrones The Board Game 2nd Ed . is set up to play three to six players . With rules to adjust for the amount of players in the game . The game itself is not for the casual gamer per sey . It 's a long game of strategy that can easily go over four hours but oh what a four hours it is ! All the theme and feel you could ever want in a strategy game is locked in this incarnation . All the houses : Stark , Lannister , Baratheon , Tyrell , Greyjoy and Martell , are in this game as you battle for territory in Westeros with political intrigue , back stabbing and hard fought war campaigns.First off let me tell you about the quality of the game itself . The components are outstanding . The board and artwork are top notch and to me really provide a rich , warm gaming experience which I love . I think it 's important to feel like you are a `` part '' of the game in the sense of actually being their and the new version does this a bit better than the original version released 10 years ago . The map is large and easy to grasp and gorgeous in imagery and laid out so no matter where you sit , everything is easy to reach and understand.The rule book is pretty well laid out so that even though there is a lot in it , it is not real hard to understand . If you read it a couple times you should be able to get a good handle on the basic operation of the game and only need to refer for special situations hopefully . Also included in the game are two quick reference sheets help shorten the game by not needing to dig in the rule book . Each player gets a screen to hide their tokens with more quick reference tidbits which is another great help to keep gameplay time down.You vie for control of the Iron Throne while trying to be the first to acquire a total of seven castles and strongholds before the 10th round ends . If no one has acquired seven castles by the end of the 10th round , then whomever has the most wins.During the game you have phases that you go through that the player order is determined by who controls the Iron Throne and the order of players that follow down the influence track ( which is bid upon during `` The Clash of Kings '' . ) You have the Westeros Phase '' ( skipped in round one ) , the Planning Phase and the Action Phase.The Westeros Phase concludes advancing the game round maker , drawing Westeros cards which may have to be resolved and advancing the Wildlings track . You may have to deal with the Wildlings in which the players secretly bid an amount of power tokens to stop them . There is a consequence to the players who bid the least if the threat is not beaten.The Planning Phase is where you assign orders ( in secret by placing them upside down on the board ) such as raids , marches , defense , consolidate power or support tokens . Raid tokens allow you to possibly interrupt another players token , hence messing up their plans and causing a bit of frustration . Always a fun tactic in a game like this . March tokens allow to advance on another players position or empty position for combat and taking over that territory if successful . Defense tokens are self-explanatory and help bolster your defense from attack from opposing players . Consolidate Power tokens allow you to gain power tokens for bidding later in the game or to muster units ( armies ) into an assigned area.The Action Phase begins with resolving raid orders based on the order of players on the Iron Throne Track . All moves in this phase are based on this order . Note this means that if you have a five player game , then the first player resolves one order , then the second player etc ... in order and comes back around to the first player if any tokens are left to be resolved . March orders are next , again one battle at a time per player and finally Consolidate Power tokens . Then you clean up the board making sure armies and tokens are removed from the board.Combat is resolved by first a call for support . Here you may ask for a players support and they may or may not help you . They may decide to help the other player instead . This gives said player a bonus based on the support played . You then calculate strength of both sides and include the `` Valyrian Steel Blade '' token ( explained later ) . Then you choose a `` House Card '' from your hand to help you with a strength bonus and hopefully a text that will hurt the opponent . This is then calculated as the Final Combat Strength . Combat resolution is : Determine the victor , casualties , retreating and routing and clean up.During the game you will have the opportunity to silent bid on the three tracks when the `` Clash of Kings '' card appears during the Westeros phase . The first track is the Iron Throne Track which determines the order players go in and allows who ever holds this token the ability to break ties outside of combat . The Fiefdoms Track allows whomever holds the `` Valyrian Steel Blade '' to win all combat times and add +1 to their combat strength . This may only be used once per turn . The King 's Court Track determines the amount of special order tokens available to each player . It also allows the holder of the `` Messenger Raven '' token to change on of his or her orders that was placed before the action phase begins and the order tokens are revealed.You also have ports and ships in the game . This allow for unit movements over large areas and ship to ship battles as well . An extremely important part of the game and critical to winning in my opinion if done right . Obviously House Greyjoy starts off strong in this type of unit.The units in this game are Footman ( 1 unit each ) , Knights ( 2 units each ) , Ships ( 1 unit each ) and Seige Engines ( 2 points each . ) Based on your Supply Track on the board determines how many units and the size of each army allowed per house . Taking over territories with barrels in them and holding them when a `` Mustering '' card comes up will allow you to increase your army of force you to decrease in the case of having more units than you can support with food.Strongholds are the larger castles that allow of two points of mustering and castles allow for 1 point of mustering . Again this happens when the `` Mustering '' card appears during the Westeros Phase . If you control enough territories with barrels then new units will appear at these places.The alliances you form in this game are a major part of the game play . You can try and align with a player but beware as there are no rules to the players actually doing what is agreed to . They may be secretly plotting with someone else at the same time . While you may align with someone , you are never allowed to show hidden order tokens or silent bids . You also may not bribe anyone with power tokens , dominance tokens , cards or any other type of piece of the game . This part is all about trust and not for the weak of heat . `` I did warn you not to trust me . '' - LittlefingerThere are other parts of the game that come into play such as Neutral Force or Garrison tokens . This stops you from just walking in someplace to take it over . You have to actually commit units to a battle to grab that territory.In my opinion this is my favorite game of all time . The amount of political backstabbing , tension from the placing of orders and whether or not you just made a mistake based on alliances with other players provides so much atmosphere and incredible game play that is hard not to love . You do n't find that a lot in games these days.Although there is a lot to it , the game is pretty easy to grasp after a couple of rounds . Do n't let the length of time dissuade you from trying it . It is well worth the time and money it costs ( $ 49.95 retail ) . The theme is excellent , the game itself is well done in terms of art , components and rules.I give it a 10 out 10 stars and highly recommend it to any board game fan and especially to Game of Thrones fans.This game is Geek Approved !

This is an excellent cooperative card game for those that play the likes of Magic : The Gathering or L5R . This game has everything you need to play for 2 players ( with a few 10 sided dice to get up to 4 players ) and is expandable via expansions ( as opposed to randomized boosters of a customizable card game ) The game is quite immersive and difficult . Players work together commanding a few heroes and a deck as they try to overcome monsters and keep their threat down to avoid the nasty Eye of Mordor , as they journey through quests to win the game . A great sense of teamwork exists as players help each other as they pilot their deck and grasp their strengths and weaknesses and support each other.There 's a moderate learning curve to playing this game and the internet is full of nice sources to help you learn how to play , but once you get the ruleset , it 's quite fun.It 's important to note this is a gamers ' game . The game is quite text heavy with fiddly texts , and those that are n't really into board games might not get a kick out of it .	1
So I have n't played many LCGs so far ( the only other ones being Game of Thrones and Cthulhu ) , but this is by far the most difficult to understand and play . I think it probably took me three of four tries after going through the rulebook before I got everything down , and I 'm still not even sure if I understand everything . I 'm not sure if I 'm just making it harder than it needs to be , or if the game really IS that difficult.Either way , this is easily my favorite LCG so far . I do n't have many people I play games with , so Game of Thrones does n't work well . Those I do play with prefer co-op games whenever possible , so Cthulhu is n't as popular ( though I would say it is the best of the three I have played just based on the core set ) . So LoTR is really where it 's at for me . It just takes a lot of trial and error to understand everything , and I 'm still having a hard time doing a play-through where I make it through the first quest without losing . I think I may be in the minority though , since most people seem to enjoy this game a lot . Just do yourselves a favor if you purchase this and watch some guides online , because the rule book can be a little vague on certain things . Fantastic game though . One of the best co-op board/card games out there .	1
To start off with , I am not much into LOTR.That said , I really enjoy the game . I bought it after reading some of the reviews about how great of a co-op game this is . After I bought this we opened it up , and started playing . The rules are easy and straight forward . The box itself is decent shape and the quality is well . The ability to customize your deck if you so choose is extremely nice.Playing through the first time , you will learn it all . We always plan on the first time being the `` learning '' curve , where we critique and learn from the mistakes . After that its great.The only complaint we could really find was the 3 quests and that is it . Granted there is a little variety on some of the quests , but still ... . Wish there was some more . There is however several expansions planned , and I can only imagine they will continue to improve upon the quest count.So for 30 bucks , this is an excellent game , and each expansion being 16 , I have paid much more for less .	1
Really love this game . The game can be a little slow at first as there is a lot of steps to learn but once you have 2-3 games under your belt you start to get into the groove . Each player chooses 3 main heroes from LOTR and a great variety of units , weapons , spells , etc which help you kill monsters and complete the quest/scenario which is the main objective . Making progress on each quest can be challenging as you have to prioritize what characters will attempt to gain progress points , defend the party from monsters , and attack monsters . Not to mention each scenario has a different setup and victory condition ; plus it 's all on a timer.On top of the fun mechanics there is also a deep deck building feature which allows you to customize your own deck from the variety of cards that are included the set . Of course there are lot of expansions available . The set comes with 3 scenarios which is okay but I feel there should have been 4-5.My only real gripe is that even though the game says it 's for 1-2 players some of the scenarios seem impossible to beat with just one player so if you 're playing solo you end up having to play two hands which I personally find burdensome but lots of people okay with that as well .	1
So I 'm a LoTR fan and also a card game fan . I 've played CCGs like MtG for 15+ years . This was my first intro to LCGs , however , which meant learning a new set of rules and understanding the structure of LCGs vs. CCGs.This core set contains 4 30-card mini-decks that can be used to play the game . Though they are not tournament legal , players can combine the decks if desired . There are also scenario cards that players use . I 've only played the simplest scenario since from what I 've read the more difficult ones are too much for the basic decks to handle . I 've played this game solo and with another player.Overall I 've really enjoyed playing this , particularly with two people . Being able to discuss strategies and how to initiate combat in a collaborative way reminds me a lot of MtG Two-Headed Giant or EDH formats , where users can partner up to beat opponents.The one complaint that I have is that the game has a steep learning curve in my opinion . The seven phases of a turn are a little complicated and it 's easy to forget one in the beginning . Still , if you like strategic card games , LoTR , and are willing to watch a few videos on YouTube like the one on the Watch It Played channel then you 'll really like this game . Highly recommend .	1
In this box you get the core set which contains 3 quests and enough cards to build roughly 2 decks if you are not picky about which cards each one gets . If you are a single player , your options are much better but you will still be limited.The 3 quests come in different difficulties , easy , medium , and Bullshit . The later is doable solo with the core set , slightly easier with 2 people , but also leads into my next point . This game is fun , and I love it , but you really want to get some expansions for it to reach its full potential . The harder quests get easier with the different cards , and with the core set the actual deck building aspect does not get much love . You usually want to make a 50 card 2 sphere deck , and they give you a 60 card pool to do that with . Not much variety there , however with the 6 or so expansion packs for the core set . Then the big box sets and expansions for those give you even more.This game is a addiction , I have bought hundreds of cards after this . Then you need sleeves for them ... and dividers ... and a custom box inlay . Then you are building decks for different quests , and keeping written lists of the cards for each one in the boxes . It turns into a full on hobby and not just a random game you play from time to time.The card art is good , and the different card effects are varied . The rules are easy enough , but you will want the book on hand for the first few games . I read the rules once , tried to play and reference it a lot my first few turns . Once you figure it out though , the game flows nicely . And I love that it works well for a solo game . Sometimes you want to play and nobody is around , hell it happens a lot it seems.There is also a computer version of this you can grab for free , you could always check that out first and see if the game is something you are into before buying .	1
i picked up this game because i always like the option to play solitaire if possible . i 'm interested in the hobbit expansions , though after playing a few games of this , i will probably wait and get other expansions before that one . i also picked this game up instead of game of thrones LCG because i heard that AGoT was more fun with more people , and this one scales well ( making it fun with two , or even solo ) . read up on any of these games on boardgamegeek for lots more info . happy gaming !	1
I bought this card game for my 20something son . He worked for a board game company and now works for a video game company . He only asks for games he has researched and/or played . He likes this game very much . I like Tolkien 's books and am always happy to buy anything associated with them as they seem to incorporate the same quality .	1
Let me start by saying , the art to this game is completely phenomenal . Simply put , the art is some of the best in all of gaming ... bar none ! Also , the cards are of nice stock and have a nice texture to them.The game play is solid . Although most people complain about how hard the rules are , my house rules give me a chance to win . Yeah , the rules are THAT difficult , so beware , the core rules could frustrate you.LotR-CCG is not a deck building game or a collectible card game either , instead it uses cards like a Dungeon Master and events and enemies pop up and how your heroes deal with ... that is up to you . It feels like a dungeon crawler to me sometimes or a 1-2 man massively simplified D & D ; game ( without the character customization ) . I have now owned this game almost two years now , and it is a bit stale for me . Not because it 's a bad game , simply I have played it to death . I can now say after solid multiple plays , there are a few things missing ( or should I say , some things that could be better ) .1 . It needs more character customization . There needs to be more getting rings , new swords or `` loot '' ( like in the World of Warcraft video game ) . Also every kill , successful action or successful mission should give your character ( s ) benefits . There really are n't any significant rewards for success ( other than the `` end game '' win ) and no `` in-game-development '' .2 . I would like a actual board to put the cards on as well , and with this game being a bit more expensive than it needs to be , ( especially with the majority of components being cards ) they should of included other components like a board.3 . I do n't always feel like I am `` in a location '' as the cards suggest , and characters do odd things sometimes . Keep in mind , the Lord of the Rings world is a very real one to many of it 's literary audiences , and I do n't FEEL that often in the game . Like so many games , you sometimes ask yourself , `` would Frodo do this ? '' or ... `` Legolas is doing what ? '' 4 . The eye timer component is meant to speed up the game so the scenario does n't last all day , but this is a bit frustrating and you can lose a scenario due to that component . I would of preferred the scenario telling the player , `` you have to hurry and in two rounds you must free the Hobbits before they die '' ... some other way of speeding things up and limiting you that make more sense . I simply do not care for the game 's `` Threat level '' .5 . Some scenarios like `` The Lurker in the Water '' is too short ( and like two pages in the LotR novels ) . These scenarios need to be double the length much like Pathfinder 's Adventure Card Game . The scenarios do n't seem to have as much depth , richness or flavor as there should be . For example , when you get to a location , why could you not `` get information from a town 's farmer '' ? ( or other NPC 's that would give more depth and theme ) . With the rich and deep world that Tolkien has created , you 'd think the creators of this game would of delved into it a bit more.6 . Like other reviewers have eluded to , the very nature of Fantasy Flight 's Living Card System is different than a collectible card game . It is NOT like Magic the Gathering , but you can sink lots of money into it 's many many expansion packs . But it does feel like they are milking your pocket book dry . So buyer beware of the many dollars you can and probably will sink into this game ( even though the base game is very playable `` as-is '' ... and without expansions ) .With all these criticisms , Lord of the Rings Living Card game is fun and it 's a solid game with amazing illustrations and quality components . Just keep in mind , like any game , it has short-comings and ultimately you 'll probably be buying more than the base game and much poorer than you expected to be.Have a great day and happy gaming !	1
LOTR LCG is a great game . Artwork and mechanics are incredible . I have only played solo and it is brutal . Looking forward to trying co-op .	1
My son could not wait to get this book . He has been playing with it non-stop , creating new contraptions with the Legos it comes with . It is so fun to watch build and experiment with the Legos , rather than just building a set that makes a specific design ( although he loves those , too ) .Plus , it 's a fun book to read - definitely a must-have if your child loves Legos , as much as mine does .	1
Ca n't wait to give this to my son ! It comes with few lego pieces , but the BOOK is great ! It is very detailed ! He wanted this so bad !	1
one of our favorite toys for budding engineer	1
My 12 year old son loves bulding Legos and this kit adds a new challenge . A high quaility kit that is very reasonably priced . I would highly recommend it .	1
My grandson and I spent hours playing with this . He is now impressed with my ability to construct things with Lego blocks	1
My son has n't used it yet and I gave one for a birthday present . I like the fact that there are n't tons of pieces and it 's very compact with the small box and a manual . The contraptions all do something , which I think appeals to kids . This set is also great because , unlike other lego sets , once you make something you can take it apart and make many other things . I actually think this will become my go to gift for little boys .	1
My 7 year old received this for Christmas ; we 've made several of the `` contraptions '' and they have all turned out pretty neat . There are detailed instructions to build 16 projects ( not all at the same time ) , all of which move in some way . The lastest we built was a gear-driven , rubberband powered car . You build it , crank it up ( which winds a rubberband ) , and set it on the floor . The unwinding rubberband turns gears which turn the wheels . Very neat to see and the car goes and goes . Lego says this car will go 50 feet and they are not exaggerating . The kit has a lot of the `` Technic '' type parts that normal Lego sets do not have . This is a great way to check out the Technic parts capabilities without investing in a pricey Technic set that makes a single item . Lego/Klutz says this set is for ages 7+ ; that 's about right as some of the designs could be a little tricky for my 7 yo to do , not from a `` I do n't understand what to do '' standpoint but just a `` I ca n't get this part on while holding these parts in place '' standpoint .	1
My 5 years old daughter with my help could create various gadgets and machines . This set allows you to create variety of machines and each machine has moving parts that include rubber bands and wheels .	1
This item is made well , which means that I will likely be able ot use it for several years . The pockets are large enough that my two and four year old can get out the items and return them without tearing the pockets . Additionally , each item has a number on the back , so my daughters can return each item to the correct spot . I did n't want to spend a lot of money , but this proved to be worth it as my daugthers played with this almost every day and it is showing no wear .	1
I fell in love with this Advent calendar when I was looking for one to give my grandson as a first birthday gift . His parents are active in their church and would not have appreciated one of the many secular Advent calendars which are available . This colorful Advent calendar allows your little one to learn the true meaning of Christmas as he or she places a figure onto the Bethlehem scene each day . Further , the calendar does play a Christmas hymn when pressed at the appropriate point ; this is particularly fascinating for younger children.This calendar is made reasonably well . The figurines are finished with a top stitch rather than blind stitch ; while I appreciate the fact that blind stitching might have added to the price , I would have preferred the figures to be finished with a blind stitch . The calendar does `` droop '' somewhat since there is no support along the top edge . I solved this problem by hand sewing loops of bias tape onto the back and inserting a thin wood strip that my husband cut in his shop.Fisher-Price still has this calendar on their web site for $ 30 . If you sign up for their notices and catalogs , you may be able to get free shipping on this item.If you are looking for an Advent calendar which will help you teach your little one the true meaning of Christmas , then you should consider the Little People Nativity Advent Calendar . You will not be disappointed .	1
This calendar is exactly what I wanted with three little kids in the house . they ca n't ruin this one ! and they love playing with it . great thing for them to do all month to keep reminding them what Christmas is really about . I just wish I 'd read the comments about overpaying -- apparently you can get it cheaper elsewhere . ah , well . I 'm still glad I purchased it .	1
This advent calendar is on sale right now at the fisher price website . I just ordered mine for $ 24 ! Save some money !	1
... and she is only 15 months old ! Great way to count down to Christmas . Well made and will keep your child 's interest . We put ours up in the dining room and add the day 's character after dinner .	1
The fabric calendar comes with 25 bundle-figures with the traditional figures of a Nativity and a few contemporary characters sure to make your little ones laugh ( a cat and a dog ) . Each figure comes with the corresponding number on the back , thus , no need to guess where each goes . However , although they are rated by degree of importance , you can not see the numbers thus , if you wanted to place them in a different order , it is completely possible . Each figure can be attached to the nativity scene through rounds of velcro that held very well the whole 25 days . The images are charming ( just like traditional Little People toys ) and the colors are beautiful . The numbers are lined by color so as you can see , other than teaching about the nativity , the calendar can be used to reach about numbers , colors and dates . Good investment .	1
Beautiful Advent calendar , but the pictures show the kid pressing a button to play sound/music . The actual product does n't have any sound . $ 45 was way too much for this product , but it 's one of the few Advent calendars that show the true meaning of Christmas , so I 'm keeping it . It loses a star because of the pictures showing a different version of the product you get . I can see it being a beautiful Christmas tradition in my house for years to come ( too bad about the lack of sound , though ! My two-year old would have loved that . )	1
Bought as a gift . Probably ideal for a 9-12 year old girl -- they 're old enough to appreciate the writing prompts , but not yet too grown-up for this . It has a lock and key to keep her secrets and it 's just a sweet , innocent starter diary to keep her young as long as you can .	1
I purchased this for my little grand daughter and she loves it . Very personal and very private to keep her little brother and sister out	1
My grand daughter really liked this . She writes all about her family , friends and her gymnastics that she does in here . She writes down everything she does , school field trips , bicycle rides etc .	1
The best gift to give a `` tween '' is a tool in which they can express themselves without limitations ... My 11 year old niece LOVES her diary . She locks and unlocks it all the time . She carries it with her wherever she goes and she writes in it throughout the day.I 'm so happy !	1
She remembered this specifically . Super age appropriate for 10 yr. old . I always buy stuff I had as a kid.. its a classic .	1
The first thing I will say is what the owner of the game store told me to convince me to buy Thunderstone . It plays like Dominion . If you are a fan of Dominion , chances are you will like this game . In fact I think it is better for a couple of reasons . First , remember how Dominion games tend to end quickly in 2 player or with certain card setups ? Everyone grabs 2 or 3 Provinces and it is over . The game ending card in this game , the Thunderstone , is guaranteed to be in the bottom 10 cards of the 31 card monster deck . That means everyone will have a chance to build their deck to work well . Also the victory point cards ( monsters ) are worth gold when they end up in your hand . In Dominion the victory cards are generally dead cards during the game . So often people ignore the lower point cards and rush straight for the big ones . There are times when you will kill the monster worth 0 or 1 victory points just because it is worth 3 or 4 gold when it is in your hand.If you have never played Dominion I will try to explain . You can find actual game rules at AEG 's ( the producer ) website or on Board Game Geek . It is a deck building game . That is , you building a deck as you play the game . You can either go to the Village and improve your deck or go the dungeon and kill monsters . Generally monsters are the only source of victory points . There are a few exceptions but you can not win without killing some monsters.You start each game with a set hand of 12 cards and start each turn with 6 cards . As you kill monsters , buy cards , or level up heroes you put those new cards into your discard pile . At the end of your turn , discard your hand and draw 6 new cards . When you have no more cards left to draw you shuffle your discard pile and it becomes your deck . So as the game progresses you are adding cards to your deck which will eventually end up as part of your hand.The goal is to have as many victory points as possible when the game ends . The game ends when a player either gets the Thunderstone ( by killing the monster carrying it ) or when the Thunderstone makes it to the end of the dungeon . There are 31 monster cards in the monster deck and the Thunderstone is shuffled into the bottom 10 . At any given point , only 3 monsters are revealed . So it does take time to play a full game ( 30 minutes to an hour for most games depending on what cards are in play and how many players ) .When building your deck throughout the game remember that your ultimate goal is to get victory points , which means you have to be able to kill monsters , which means you need to have a high attack score when you go to the dungeon and some cards that produce light . You can read how exactly the combat works in the rules but I wanted to explain that to someone that was new to deck building card games.Every game has 3 random monster types , 4 random heroes , and 8 random village cards . So chances are you will never play the exact same game twice . A strategy that works great one game may not work at all the next . Maybe one game you have a lot of fighter heroes but not much magic . Maybe next game you play with a lot of monsters that are hard to kill without magic . One game you may have heroes that produce light by themselves . Next game you may have to buy cards whose only job is to produce light.All of this makes the game have great replay value . Since the setups constantly change , your strategies will change , meaning it will not feel like the same exact game over and over again.The rules that come with the game are a bit of a mess but fortunately AEG produced a new set of rules that lay out turn orders and answer a lot of questions . Find the new rules online . Also there are rules for solo play either at AEG or BoardGame Geek . The solo format is a great way to learn how to build faster decks . and unlike many games that are meant for 2+ but have solo rules , the solo variant plays very well.The game is for 2-5 players . Unfortunately there is no way to have more than 5 players now . The 12 card decks everyone starts with are the same every game and there are only enough Militia cards for 5 players . If you want to try 6-8 players the game may work , though you might need to tweak some things , but you will need more than one copy of the game.The cards fit perfectly into standard card sleeves . I have all of my cards in Dragonshield sleeves.Overall it is a fun game with a lot of variety and is right up there with any other card game . I 've played about 30-40 multiplayer games and 10 solo games and still enjoy the challenge every time I pull it out . I would recommend it to anyone that liked Dominion or other deck building games . For someone that never tried a similar game but liked CCGs like Magic , I 'd say give it a chance . The style may be different but it is easy to understand for anyone that has played CCGs . It will probably take anywhere from a few turns all the way to a full game or two to realize what is going on . But once you learn the basics you can get fairly good at the game after just a couple of playthroughs .	1
This is an excellent deck-building game , and I 'd go so far to say that for me it is better than the game which clearly inspired it , Dominion . I love Dominion , but there 's just inherently something more satisfying about gathering a party of heroes and journeying into a dungeon to kill monsters . The wide variety of different heroes , monsters , and village items ensures that no two games are ever identical.It takes a fair amount of strategy to build an effective deck , and there are many ways to go about it depending on which cards are in the game . I have found that it is ideal to play with 3-4 players . 5 seems a few too many ( even adding extra heroes/items , the balance still seems off ) , and even though you can play with just 2 players ( or even solo , really ) it cuts down on the overall strategy when you do so . The amount of luck in this game is not all that big ; yes , what you draw does determine what you can do but that is one reason you have to be very , very careful about what cards go into your deck and the overall balance.One of the things that I think makes this game better than Dominion is that there are a lot of ways to destroy cards ( remove them from the game ) and keep your deck down to a manageable size . In Dominion there 's a lot of discard effects but not really a huge number of ways to remove cards and reduce your deck size , and the deck can get unwieldy in longer games . In Thunderstone , your deck at the end of the game is generally around 30-40 cards max if you are careful and keep your deck balanced.I also like that when released , the game itself and its expansions ( one so far , but more in the works ) are only $ 30 , which is $ 15 cheaper than a Dominion expansion when it is first released . If you like Dominion , you will likely really love this game . It 's very well balanced , unique , and a lot of fun to play overall . It moves along at a good clip too and usually plays in about 30-45 minutes depending on the number of players and their familiarity with the rules , which are n't all that complicated.In terms of downsides , the cards are a little bit on the flimsy side , and I have noticed that some of the more common ones that are in use every game are starting to come apart a bit after just a few games of play . It 's not a huge problem though , and you can always place proctors around your cards if that sort of thing really bugs you . Also , when playing with new players , it 's easy for a more experienced player to really run up the score , which can get discouraging . Although , the rules and strategy are fairly easy to pick up and after a couple of games the experience playing field is a bit more even , so that 's nice.Overall , Thunderstone is a well-designed , well-balanced game that is a lot of fun to play and I highly recommend it .	1
I was just introduced to Dominion a few weeks ago and thoroughly enjoyed the innovative `` deck-building '' mechanic of that game . I went to a local board game store to look at some games and maybe to buy Dominion when the guy told me I might like Thunderstone . I usually do n't buy games unless I 've played them before so I know what to expect , but I decided to take a chance on this one . I 'm glad I did ! Thunderstone really takes the deck-building game up a notch and adds in an awesome fantasy theme . The art is top-notch and the overall production values are excellent . The game is slightly more complicated than Dominion , but it makes for a more involved experience . I really like that you can play it solo and it actually works really well in that regard . Recommended !	1
Game is well designed and good for 3-4 players , but better with the more players you have as games with fewer players will often end quickly.Cards are humorous and everything is colorful . Game time is about 30-45 minutes . The rules are easy to pick up , especially for kids that love board games and understand the basics of this kind of game-play .	1
This is one of the best games I have ever played . The game seems a little complex at first , but once you play for a few minutes you 'll learn the rules and get comfortable playing . I had the chance to play this game with a group of fellow writers . In addition to the normal rules , we had a rule where every kill attempt had to be made with a story appropriate to the room and weapon type , and every save attempt had to go along with that story and the type of save . It was a ton of fun , and I 'd suggest this rule addition to anyone else who enjoys creative improv.In addition to having this nice board game version , this game is also available as a printout on the Cheapass Games website.Happy killing !	1
This is one of my favorite games . Definitely worth getting , kinda resembles clue , so if your not into these games then rethink purchasing this game . But if you and your company enjoy those games then this one is for you ! ! ! Love it , so much fun .	1
It was originally published by one of my favorite game companies `` Cheapass Games '' . It has been produced by two different companies . First one is the Original Version from Cheapass Games . It retails for $ 7.50 and is just a basic black and white no frills version of the game . The other version is released by Titan Games . It retails for $ 34.95 . It is a color version of the game on a nice glossy board with tokens and game cards with beautiful artwork.Think of the game as Clue in Reverse . The object is quite simply to Kill Doctor Lucky . It helps to find a weapon , then track the old man down , and do him in . But it 's not as easy as it sounds because all of your fellow players would rather do it first and Doctor Lucky is aptly named . You would think that after being stabbed , hung , poisoned , and poked in the eye , the Old Doctor would just lie down and accept his fate . But he 's got more lives than Rasputin , and an uncanny knack for dodging your best traps . Then there 's the dog , but we 'll talk more about him later.Game Synopsis : Everyone starts in the Drawing room , and everyone wants to kill Doctor Lucky . Players move around the mansion looking for weapons and trying to catch the old man alone . Trying to kill the Doctor is pretty easy , but every other player can play Failure cards to stop you . Doctor Lucky 's luck runs out eventually , though , and you just hope you can catch him when it does .	1
I bought this version of the game because it included the `` ... And His Little Dog , Too '' expansion , and was disappointed to find that the wooden pawns and spite tokens from the previous edition ( from Titanic Games ) had been replaced with illustrated cardboard punch-outs for this Paizo edition . The illustrations are good and the cardboard is sturdy to be sure , but I think I preferred those wooden pieces . Also , the cards in this edition are not textured like they were with the Titanic edition , and therefore do n't shuffle as well . I assume that 's why the price for this Paizo edition is a little cheaper even with the expansion included.You win by killing Dr. Lucky , who moves around his mansion in a generally predictable pattern . You can only kill him when you are in the same room with him , and no other player can see you . Go for it with your bare hands , or play a weapon card to increase your chances . Move yourself OR the Doctor by playing a room card when the timing is right . Other players will try to foil your attempts by playing `` failure '' cards that do n't have to be , but probably should be read aloud , because most of them range from absurd to hilarious.As someone who plays this game often , I unfortunately do n't find the Dog expansion or its rule variants to offer that much more interest . However , the basic game is so good , that I will still continue to play it with friends and even my kids , now that they 're old enough to appreciate the humor . Finishing him off in the kitchen with a Civil War cannon , or in the armory with a monkey hand always makes for a good laugh around the table.I own 4 versions of this game , going back over 10 years to when it came in a skinny little black-and-white box with board sections made of laminated card stock , and you had to use the pawns from monopoly or some other game you never play . It cost about 6 bucks . The humor and the simple game mechanics made it one of my favorites then , and made me realize that a great design is the most important feature of a game . If it is n't fun or interesting , nobody will want to play no matter what it looks like . The original design with the finely illustrated board and cards make this a winner all around , and highly recommended even without the wooden pieces .	1
Great , twisted family game for older kids . It 's basically like Clue in reverse ! Instead of trying to find out who killed your host , you and all of the other players set out to kill him ( and , in an additional version , his little dog too ) ! Very fun game , but can go a little long .	1
This is a great game . It is pretty much reverse Clue . Instead of trying to find out who killed someone , you are trying to kill . Very well thought out game .	1
Being relatively new to the board gaming community , I have been dabbling here and there trying to find a good game that scales from solo play all the way up to multiple players . Upon receiving my copy of Pathfinder ACG , I immediately dug into the first scenarios and found that this is a very clever card game that I have since developed a bit of an addiction to . This game plays great solo ! Plays even better with 2 or more players ! The thing that I like best about the game is that there is player progression between multiple scenarios which comprise several adventures . There is nothing like getting that new weapon in your hand that allows you to roll more just one more die to fight or acquire goodies . I highly recommend this game and I think if you are on the fence , you should definitely give it a shot as it 's well worth your time .	1
Tabletop RPGs were this big scary world to me . I did n't know what to expect . I thought it was going to be a little weird . As I learned more , I became more and more excited and started to look for a place to begin . I settled on this and was not disappointed.Why Pathfinder ? Well , the beginner box is excellent , but I 'll get to that later . Another benefit is that the full game system documentation is available for use online for free . PDFs can be had for $ 10 , and of course the print copies are available too . Having so many options available is wonderful . Finally , it has much in common with Dungeons & Dragons ( arguably the most popular PnPRPG out there ) , so familiarity with one will help familiarity with the other.The Pathfinder Beginner Box is a great value and a great teaching tool . I 'll start with the latter . There are condensed rule books that provide you with a simpler - but not dumbed down - version of the rules . Character sheets are clearly laid out so that you know what you 're supposed to enter where and when . Thorough and clear explanations are made for both players and dungeon masters , enabling both to really get a feel for what it is that they need to do . There is even an intro adventure to go through solo to get used to how basic concepts in the game work - what die is rolled , when , and how modifiers work . Nothing is overwhelming.The value is also excellent . Within this , you get a player rulebook , a DM rulebook , a set of RPG dice , several pawn figurines ( used as miniatures for the game ) , and a very large 1 & # 34 ; x 1 & # 34 ; gridded sheet for dry erase markers that you can use to design your dungeon . The supplies alone are worth the cost of the box . The rule books are , again , very thorough and there are some websites that have devised ways of playing only by these rules at a maximum level of five for the duration of a campaign . I must admit that such a structure is intriguing and seems feasible . In other words , you do n't necessarily need anything more than this.The beginner box is limiting in some ways . Not every class and race is present , likely as not to overwhelm new players with options . This is a good choice , though it may become problematic as one gains more experience . Fan websites have documents that add some of those in a manner that is compatible with beginner box play , so there are options out there.Bottom line - a good introduction to tabletop RPGs or the Pathfinder system with resources that make it worthwhile for players that have some experience .	1
I have mixed emotions about the pathfinder system as I had started out on the early 80 's Basic D & D ; , then Expert set , then the AD & D ; core rulebooks . I quit playing shortly after getting the 2nd edition rule books , not because I thought they were bad , but life presented priorities.Now that I have time to kill and nephews that need to get off the computer , I picked up this PBB to introduce them to roleplaying games.I think this intro does an excellent job but maybe it 's my age because I think some areas are overly complicated . Where this beginner box excels is making these complications easier to understand.On the one hand , it makes creating characters somewhat easy , but character creation is quite involved and slow work w/ the skill system and such . Not that that is bad . It just shows the amount of depth the game presents even at the beginner lvl.Where this set shines is the included dungeon and fold out playing mat . The playing pieces are cardboard but for the price , I think we are all after a decent playing system first and foremost over fancy minis.This beginner box makes easy setup and play for new players easy , despite an in depth rule system . I think it would be nice if it was like the my old D & D ; and they continued making modules just for the beginner rules set w/o forcing gamers to adapt to the main core rules . If I jump to the core rules , I prefer to dictate when I do it.Having looked into the D & D ; 4.0 rules set , I 'm convinced that Pathfinder is the way to go if I 'm going to do RPG 's ( Some call it D & D ; 3.75 ) . The fact that WotC is moving on to D & D ; 5.0 pretty much confirms my decision .	1
This is such a well-reviewed game , I do not think I have much to add other than my 12 year old son , a huge RPG fan , LOVES it and enjoys playing it on his own.By chance , I happened into his bedroom to look at the game and noticed it came with character layout sheets . I was thankful I was able to snag a clean copy of the sheet for the manufacturer-authorized photocopying before he had used them all to develop his characters ( I think there are only 5 sheets in the box . ) I now have one set aside in my office for the future .	1
we got this for our 10 year old son who is totally into role-playing games . This particular version came highly recommended by a euro-gamer enthusiast we are friends with . We have played several times with him and it 's great ! ! Only thing : I wish the laminated board was a bit less ... curly . maybe a & # 34 ; real & # 34 ; euro board laminated but rigid so it would stay flat ?	1
I tried the recent D & D ; Redbox and I hated it . I tried this Pathfinder box and I felt it gave me a real understanding of the game.Both books are very solid , I love the small cardboard figures it comes with , and it explains things in ways that even someone brand new to table-top gaming can understand.I ca n't recommend this enough . And even if you 've played before it comes with some great card-board figure holders , it comes with a map that is dry-erase friendly , and it comes with a set of dice ! One thing to note - Paizo 's website has further support for this pack if you finish the included adventure and you get bored with the 4 included classes . They add the class Berserker to the beginner box on there and they have yet another pre-constructed adventure to run though . I absolutely love the company who made this and will be purchasing more from them in the future .	1
Like some others , I bought the D & D 4th ed red box as well , and my main disappointment with that was the lack of character creation instructions . You build a character as you go through the intro adventure but a LOT is left unexplained or completely omitted , and who wants to go through an adventure every time they build a character ! ? Pathfinder 's intro books are much clearer and they even give you a cheat sheet inside the book covers for how to do it . While the D & D art in later volumes is definitely more professional and painterly looking than the comic book-style Pathfinder uses , that 's not the case in the two beginner sets . There 's no contest , because the D & D ones look like art students made them while Pathfinder 's are the ones that look professionally done . I know a lot of experienced people were turned off by D & D 's 4th edition rules and gravitated to Pathfinder ( which is often called D & D v3.75 ) but I have n't gotten deep enough into either to say I like one over the other . They 're both similar and I think most beginners wo n't notice differences or care when they do . Pathfinder 's box however includes more and is higher quality than the D & D one and it has made me want to go further with their system .	1
Pathfinder is a game where you create or pick a character and become that character and have a fantastic adventure right at your table ! Now the recommended age is 13+ but the Beginner Box was used to teach kids as young as 4 ( the Gentleman ! ) at Gen Con ! That is actually ( of course ) how we discovered it and we are hooked ! My son and I have attended Gen Con for the last two years in full . By that I mean we spend all four days playing games at booths , in hallways during snacks and meal breaks and after the hall closes we played games at random tables . This year was the first year my son was able to sign up for anything . We were both excited and the first thing we signed up for was Pathfinder Kid & # 8217 ; s Beginner Track.I wasn & # 8217 ; t 100 % he would be able to understand or follow along but they were great at explaining and the Gentleman did just fine . The Beginner Box is the BEST way to introduce ANYONE of any age to the wonderful world of Role Playing Games ( RPG ) . I am sure you have heard of Dungeons and Dragons or D & D ; by now . If you ever played it then you will LOVE Pathfinder for sure as it uses the base rules from D & D ; 3.5 . Those not familiar with any RPG will be able to dive right in and fall in love just from this box ! Read more of my review on My Geeklings here - [ ... ]	1
Open this box costing less than any of the rulebooks for D20-derived High Fantasy RPGs and you are in for a treat.You get a gamesmaster book in glorious full color containing the parts of the game the GM needs to master and the bestiary , alomng with oodles of advice presented in such a beginner-friendly format I reckon the only downside is a veteran GM will feel a little underwhelmed by the cartoony , easy-peasy approach to the material compared with the no-nonsense full rulebook . But hey , the experienced GM is not who this set was aimed at . Read accordingly . Everything you need to run a game on this set 's terms is in here and presented in a way that makes uptake easy . There 's also an introductory adventure.You get a player handbook in glorious full color too , containing the character build process , player-specific rules and oodles of advice on how to play the various core character types presented ( you do n't get 'em all , but the ones you do get are the classics , the White Box D & D ; + Greyhawk set - Fighter , Cleric , Rogue and Wizard ) .You get a double-sided wet/dry-erase ready laminated map on which to display your tactical situations . One side pre-printed with detail , the other an earth tone blank with grid.You get a complete set of poly dice.You get three sheets of punch-out standees ( cardboard tokens showing the monster/character it represents , drawn to 29mm scale and compatible with most ranges of figures ) . I wish we 'd had these when I was first getting started . I 'd have save a fortune in lead and storage would have been so much easier.You get a bag of stands to clip the card token into.You get a team of four pre-generated characters . If your game group is absolutely brand new to RPGs I ca n't think there is a better product out there for you : not only do they give you the rules , dice and figures , you do n't even have to make the characters at first ! There 's even a solo adventure so you can see how it all works before you try and run a game for your friends.I 'm an experienced GM and I liked the look of it all so much I bought the set from my Local Friendly Game Store . I 'm going to run the contents for people too.Recommended , especially for beginning RP gamers .	1
This box contains everything you need to learn the basics of the Pathfinder RPG system . Granted , it 's not everything , if you intend on getting into the full RPG and adventures that go with it , but it is a great way to introduce yourself or others into the system.It was a bit overwhelming in the beginning as there is a lot to read and take in , but Paizo created an adventure that is included that walks you through the entire adventure . Creating a character is super easy as well . Paizo created a walkthrough for creating the character that makes it very easy to fill out each box with the appropriate info and explains what each thing does and why.The box comes with everything you 'd need to play the beginner adventure as well as things you 'd need to move on to the full RPG . You get a map that is blank on one side for your own adventures and printed for the included adventure . A set of dice and a whole bunch of cardboard characters and monsters.If you have had no exposure to the Pathfinder universe/RPG , this is a great way to learn about it and introduce others to it . If you already have friends that play Pathfinder , I 'd recommend creating a character with them and jump right into the main RPG with help from your friends .	1
The Pathfinder Card Game is unique in it 's RPG type mechanic in a card game . I enjoy playing it . Having additional sets that continue the story is a great concept .	1
Love The game Pathfinder Adventure Card Game.. my son and I play this game all the time and this Expansion does not disappoint.. Highly recommend this deck.. Fun to play thru and am looking forward to more expansions.. Great card quality , if you like the game Pathfinder adventure card game then stop reading this and buy it..	1
This expansion deck is a great way to continue your journey in the Pathfinder world you cant go wrong with this one	1
My husband and I LOVE Pathfinder - and each adventure has been just as good as the last . This is a lot of fun for a little price - very worth the investment if you enjoy the game !	1
If you are a fan of the Pathfinder card game , you really should get the add on decks . They continue the adventure with more monsters and locations and scenarios and loot ! What more could a dungeon hack ask for ? ?	1
My son loves this , half a year after getting it , still.It seems most negative reviews deal with the unexpectedly small size ( if they do n't read the item notes ) , and with issues putting it together ( it comes with instructions ) .It is very small , maybe 4 inches by 6 inches.We buy an eleven-cent cricket from Petsmart , and he gets to keep it in it 's playground until it dies of old age ( a few months later , depending on the size when you buy it ) .It 's easy to carry around , is well made , and has a lid that clicks to shut.The only holes are air holes in the lid , and they 're quite small ( an ant might escape , if it 's small ) .It is easily washable.Again , my son loves it , and watches to see if they go down the slide , through the tunnel , up to the tower , or up and through the mountain . He really enjoys it . And , if you do n't have bugs available to catch , you can always find them inexpensively at the pet store.It came with a bug catcher , but he was a little too rough on it , so the end came off ... we bought it for the playground anyway , so it was n't a big deal.All of our pieces fit together perfectly ( snugly , which is important , when holding bugs inside ) . It comes disassembled , which is probably a good idea , since it comes with pieces that fit inside , but does include instructions . It may seem flimsy , at first , but it comes with eight very small corner attachments which really lock the walls into place . I did n't see them at first , but if you do n't put them in , it comes apart easily . Also , each wall has a top and bottom , one of which has notches , as well as grooves to keep the wall tight ( which may be why some people ca n't fit it together , and give a bad review , if they do n't notice them ... or do n't read the instructions ) . If you do n't see that , you may not put it together correctly.Lastly , I said to my son ( who is four ) in passing that it was kind of small , and he rolled his eyes at me , and said , `` It 's a playground , MOM , not a house ! '' I suppose he 's right . Bugs are pretty small- they do n't need something the size of a hamster cage ... we lose sight of ours in this ; I ca n't imagine how bored kids would get if it was much bigger.We use this as a cricket home ( people in Japan use MUCH smaller houses for their crickets , and the crickets do n't seem to mind , so I guess it 's not small to bugs ) , and use the 'pool ' as a food/water dish for the bugs . It works perfectly.We 've been using it since the second week of December ( seven months ago ) , non-stop , and my son still loves it.He carried it to church for the pet blessings , and we taped the lid shut.Really recommend this item . If your child likes open-ended play , they will love this .	1
My 6 yr old kid LOVES this thing . It 's not very big , but it 's for bugs ! It has a slide , a pool , and a mountain ! As silly as it is , my kid thinks it 's gr8 when the critters are crawling down the slide or drinking from the swimming pool . I guess it 's the joining of nature to a child 's world , a playground !	1
Adorable Fun ! It is small , but so cute . It is about the size of my husband 's hand , but was easy to put together and except for one piece ( the small blue roof inside ) -- it stays together well . My 6 1/2 yearold son caught a lightning bug and was amazed at watching him climb on the stairs , go down the slide and up the rock wall , then drink from the small pool . We have taken his pet bug to the beach and out to dinner , and many curious on-lookers ask him about it . It was such a perfect end of school present and I highly recommend it !	1
so cute . bought for my 7 yr old nephew .	1
From the moment my oldest son ( 9 ) saw this in the box , I was surprised at the wide-eyed joy he took in every facet of it 's operation.By the time I had gotten the dishes done and made lunches for the next day , he had it out of the box and was already programming it.Programing is a bit tedious , especially at first . But besides giving a few programming tips , and few hints on creating chart of standard distances in the house to avoid needed to constantly remeasure , he has done it entirely on his own.My youngest son ( 5 ) loves to help , mostly this involves helping measure the distances , and clapping with glee when the robot does what it is supposed to.The robot is quite slow , but hopefully that helps it conserve batteries.Given my oldest 's interest in robotics and my desire to see him learn programming as he grows up , this is probably the best toy I could have gotten him at the moment . It is teaching him to think logically , look at tasks as segments , and to plan ahead , all very good skills.With school out for the past couple of days they have had a good chance to use it over the past week and so far it has been their favorite thing to do , even over playing the Wii.I have a few challenges I plan to give him in the future to keep his interest in this toy , but for now , I have n't needed to do anything at all .	1
Disclaimer : I am reviewing the product , the programmable Rover , that was offered to me for free through the Vine program.Unfortunately I never received the product ! The package must have gotten lost in shipping . So I 'm sorry but I can not review the actual product , as much as we were looking forward to trying it.However , now Amazon Vine is changing their policy so I am required to write a review , even though I never received the product in question . So I 'm sorry but please disregard this review ...	1
My kids really got into following the Curiosity Rover currently on Mars and my eldest has enjoyed simple robotics - so having a programmable rover was a great treat . One thing I like was this was ready to use right out of the box . Because of this , it is very , very simple . There are 6 buttons you are using ( on/off , insert/delete , exit/stop , record , enter , save ) and 4 way arrow controls . So , you can program it , but it is n't going to do real complex moves . If you have a child just getting into programming - this is a perfect fit . If your kid is already using Lego Mindstorms - skip this , it will be way too simple.One thing I like is that the treads are very sturdy , so this rover did well on our hard wood floors . We did n't try it on carpet . My eldest is 7 , so he was quite happy with all that he could do with this . If you have a younger child into robots , a slightly older child into programming , or really want a novelty item for a space buff - this would be a great fit . Pretty durable , but do n't throw it down the stairs or anything like that . Overall I can recommend this for the right audience .	1
The Programmer Rover was a huge hit for my boys , one 9 average student and the other 10 who is in accelerated/challenge classes.The instructions for the rover come in a laminated spiral bound book , very good as it is needed to be referred to often for every programmable action and therefore be built to last . The instruction booklet is well illustrated , the written instructions were clear and my nine year old was able to program the easier beginner tasks without a problem.Our boys and their friends spend hours playing with and programming the rover . The Smart Lab ReCon Rover has turned out to be both an educational and fun electronic 'toy ' , well worth the money . A++	1
I chose this toy for a 6 year old grandson . His father and I got it working and he had a wonderful time playing with it . ( So did his dad and I . ) I worked as a programmer and debuggermost of my working life , and it was really fun to get it programmed ! Watching him figure out how to get it to do different things was so much fun.I think that most kids who are computer efficient and know how to program could handle it without adult assistance . It 's a very nice toy and so far , has n't broken ! I recommend it highly .	1
Picked this up for my thirteen year old son . While it says eight an up , I think this is definitely for older kids as it involves a lot of math and thinking , which is a great motivator for kids to learn as it is fun and educational . You can teach it to do many things and bring you things , but accuracy is key , which is where the pay off is for getting your math right . Definitely a great teaching idea for kids and math and measuring , can be frustrating for younger ones but highly recommended !	1
This is a fun toy , easy to use and it provides hours of entertainment . My daughter has always wanted a robot and this one is totally awesome . She is a self-proclaimed nerd and loves electronics . This robot would be a great gift for the techie nerd in your life as well .	1
Have patience if your child greets the Smart Lab ReCon 6.0 Programmable Rover with subdued surprise . This toy robot takes a bit of time to warm up . Star Wars robots are more recognizable and , not surprisingly , more appealing to young kids.Three things to like : * Commands are entered using both an LCD screen and 10-button key pad . * The Rover comes with a 48-page spiral bound guidebook and a tape measure , so precise distances can be programmed . * The Rover 's triangular track-drive system with third wheel is adept on both hard floors and carpet.At a third of the price and half the weight of theInteractive R2-D2 , the Smart Lab ReCon 6.0 Programmable Rover is a better value and a fun learning tool for kids ages eight years and up . I 'd rather own three Smart Lab ReCon 6.0 Programmable Rovers than one R2D2.Rating : Five stars.DISCLOSURE : This review is courtesy of the Amazon Vine program , which provides products at no cost in exchange for my independent and unbiased feedback .

My grandson enjoyed the Rover and was able to master the programming within a day or so . It works as advertised and is educational . But my grandson got bored with the Rover rather quickly.The manual is extensive but somewhat confusing . You have to program every command into the Rover . And I mean every command . This can be time consuming for a child , hence the quick boredom.Watch the height when trying to chase the cat under the bed . Our Rover got stuck then the cat attacked it with wild abandon .	1
To be honest , my 11 year old says it 's worth 4 stars , but I think it 's closer to 3 . She seems to like it quite a bit and has spend a considerable amount of time reading the book and programming it all by herself . It records her voice and she can have it say various things depending upon the program that it is running on at the time . Her dad recorded a very authoritative `` DO NOT ENTER '' command while the robot was performing guard duty . She 's having a lot of fun with it and that 's basically what it 's made for but there are just a couple of areas I consider a bit undesirable.It 's loud . The motor is very loud so it would be impossible to sneak up on someone unless they 're asleep.It 's slow . It takes quite a while for it to traverse 10 feet.The panel on the front is a sticker with pictures of buttons on it placed over some sensor buttons in the plastic . I 'm sure it will wear through after a while.It takes 3 C batteries to operate.But ! It 's fun . It comes with a 5 foot long plastic tape measure in metric and English units to accurately measure out distances for programming , and the owners manual is very well done with lots of information and grids for planning your robots various programs . Plus it has a built in cup holder like-thing and it can carry small items from one place to another . It brought me a piece of candy . I thought that was very nice ! It 's a cool toy ... if I was a kid I 'd love to get one !	1
My nine year old daughter has been having a blast playing with this robot . I was a little apprehensive getting it for her because it does take some work programming it but she loves it ! In her words `` it was n't too hard to figure once I read the guide '' . She loves that she can record messages and set it up to `` patrol '' her room at night . I 'm very happy that she is enjoying it !	1
The Smart Lab ReCon robot was a lot of fun to play with . When it arrived , it was much larger than I expected and took me aback for a moment - in a good way . My husband and I took it for a spin around the house . Has some good programming features which made me nab it thinking our boys would like it . However , they 're 14 and 12 and the robot is geared , in my opinion , toward a younger crowd . It 's quite an educational tool and a lot of fun . The voice garbled a little at first when we turned it on , but then it was fine . One huge downside is if you do n't turn it off after each use , kiss your batteries goodbye as the robot seriously drains the power . A good find for people wanting a different educational tool , especially in math . And hey , who does n't like something that will bring you a soda !	1
I have three kids , and there are a lot of kids that come in and out of this house . Pretty much every kid is attracted to this toy at first , but many kids move on quickly . However ; the older kids that are electronically oriented love this toy . My 12 year old nephew , in particular , could n't get enough of this . He programmed it to bring a treat to the dog , to bring a drink to his dad , and the pacifier to his brother . He plays with it every time he comes over . I love that we have a toy he is interested in that is n't a video game . I definitely caution you to heed the age warning , it takes a fair amount of attention span and desire , but for the right kid , it is perfect !	1
The Recon Programmable Rover is a robotic-looking unit that runs on 3 c-cell batteries that are not included . What is included besides the actual rover itself , is a tape-measure & lengthy instruction guide for use when programming the rover to do things.After installing the batteries , you will have to program the unit by following instructions in the manual . You 'll enter voice commands into a recorder and basically learn how to measure distances and paths and send your rover on `` missions . `` My 15-year-old daughter had some fun with this unit and did n't seem to mind spending the time it took to program the rover , besides all the measuring that is required when choosing a path or mission.As another reviewer mentioned , this unit is slow moving . Also , it can not climb over even simple bumps in the floor , ( we have a place where the wood floor changes to tile & there is about a half inch step up and the rover fell over backwards trying to move onto it ) .Overall , I find the rover to be cute & I acknowledge that it requires users to program it extensively , which is educational to some degree , but I do n't see this toy getting much attention after a few sessions of lengthy programming . The suggestion that you can have it go get you a snack is pretty absurd . Basically , you can program it to go to a certain spot and if someone is there - and has a lightweight snack to put in his little metal rack - and that person programs him to bring the snack back to the sender or to the home position - if applicable - that 's how the snack retrieval idea came about . It 's not exactly a time-saver . I think having a remote with this rover would be ideal for things like that.This item might be a good gift idea for a child that has a lot of patience & does n't mind playing alone , programming and experimenting with it . Otherwise , I see this toy getting dusty on a shelf pretty quickly .	1
he gave me a list of things he wanted and this was one of them so I ordered it for him via amazon and had it sent to his house which arrived almost immediately . Great gift , he was thrilled and very happy .	1
Robots will no doubt become a big part of society , they will do tasks that we deem to be too dangerous or Dirty and the ReCon 6.0 is a very good toy to get your kids started in learning how to program Robots and see the results of their efforts . I would recommend this for children between the ages of 8-12 years old because it does require a certain amount of discipline in math , problem solving , spatial awareness and programming so it 's win win toy ! My only complaints would be the lack of a Remote control , it would be nicer if the code could be edited without accessing the Robot at ground level and it would be nice if it also moved a little faster.Overall I find this to be an extremely educational toy that will make a child more interested in what is sure to be a huge job market area in the next 20 years .	1
The Smart Lab ReCon 6.0 is a wonderful combination of Technology meets education . This programmable rover teaches basic programming , early mathematics , and basic problem solving . Is meant for ages 8-adult . It comes pr-eassembled so no assembly is required just pull it out of the box and let the fun begin.It also comes with a 48 page , full color guide book which includes 10 missions plus diagnostics test , mission maps , and step by step programming directions . The Smart Lab Recon 6.0 Projects create hours of entertainment , and educational family fun.If you or your kids love robots I highly recommend this gift . It 's out of this world !	1
My 11 year old LOVES robots . He makes them out of EVErYTHING . But , he 's errr ... `` efficient '' ( that 's a nice way of saying lazy . ) So programming high tech robots has been out of reach thus far , though he 's capable , he just does n't have the patience.This was a Christmas present for him , and he was able to open it and `` write '' his first program within about an hour.He then put a little camera in the back pocket and began recording things from the robot 's point of view.He 's used it as a `` guard '' for his bedroom door and a funny recording just for fun.He still enjoys it , and as the oldest of five , still keeps it safe . It 's fairly durable . No one has broken it yet ! The robot comes with a little booklet of instructions , and I did n't read a BIT of it -- - so , they must be written in easy to understand language . I 'm very pleased with this toy , and the cause and effect , precise measurements he 's having to learn to make it go where he wants it to go.Works great on our carpet and tile and wood , and is n't too noisy or too small or big.JUUUUST RIGHT !

This is a good toy . The book that comes with the toy is pretty good at explaining how the critter is programmed and even my eight year old could figure it out by looking at the book . The voice recording/playback function is amusing and adds to the fun.It works just like it is advertised to . It seems sturdy enough that it wo n't be broken easily . It is even kind of cute . Sometimes the toy will sit for a long time without anyone playing with it , but then sometimes my eight year old will get it out and spend hours playing it.It 's a good toy that teaches the basics of programming .	1
In addition to the three size C batteries , you will need a little phillips head screw driver to open the battery door , a roll of masking tape or painter 's tape to mark out squares on the floor and a bit of patience.I was running out of patience by the time I ran to the store for the batteries , struggled with the little twist ties that bind the toy in the box and realised I did n't have tape in the house.The initial set up got to a slow start . You are to program the robot to travel forward three feet , then reverse . He has a mind of his own . He walked in circles at first . Then continued to go forward with no reverse . We had to turn him on and off a few times just to get the basics started . He walks slowly and your soda will be warm by the time he brings it back to you . We sent him for a dog treat , but our mastiff barked at him like he was a lion and refused to got near the biscuit.Our ten year old friend is a quiet , patient kid and he had a blast reading the book , measuring the distances for the missions and it kept him busy for a few hours . The younger 5 and 6 year olds bailed out quickly and whet to the Just Dance Wii game for faster action and more noise.It 's a nice little toy for the right kind of kids . I 'm thinking for 3rd to 5th graders .	1
This is one of the best $ 10 toys I have bought . My son loves it . It comes with 6 car templates and several pages of decal sticker add ons ( wheels , exhaust pipes , decorations , etc. ) . It takes a while to actually design the car , and then a while to color it as well , so it almost an hour to do a really good job on one car . Maybe he 'll get faster as he becomes more familiar with all the choices , but for now I am delighted to see him spending so much time being creative . I also love that everything is reusable . If you run out of the paper provided , you simply cut regular 8x11 paper into thirds . This set is a way better value than most other craft/design/drawing sets I have purchased.The only flaws are so minimal that they are not even worth deducting a star : 1 ) the car templates are a little wider than the light-up pad thing , which really does n't make sense , and 2 ) the clip thing you put the template and paper under is difficult to use as it is so stiff . However , that does n't distract the kid at all from loving this set.I highly recommend this set to anyone who has a kid that likes car and likes drawing/creating things .	1
This kit is really cool . It comes with little tracer designs and a backup LED light so you can place all your parts where you want them and then trace your design . Then you can finish up with cool colors , accents , details , etc . You can make anything from a family SUV-type to a racecar to a Bug to everything in between . My kid spent days taking personal requests and then lovingly designing a custom car for everyone in the family . The final results are very high-quality too ! I definitely recommend this pack .	1
I got my eight-year-old son this version of the SmartLab Car Design Studio and another one ( which actually seems to be by ArtLab -- is that the same company ? ) . He prefers the brightness of the SmartLab light box , but getting the battery door out to put the batteries in was REALLY hard , and my son says it 's easier to put the pages into the ArtLab light box . I had to pry the battery door out on the SmartLab one , but the crack around it was barely wide enough to insert anything to pry with . Also , one of the transparencies in the set stuck to its sheet of paper and left ink on it ; maybe this is a one-time thing , but if the ink continues to come off , the transparencies will eventually lose their ability to perform their intended purpose.The way you assemble a car to trace ( by attaching clings to the transparencies ) is pretty cool , though , and having a light box at all seems like a huge luxury after the time I spent as a kid with a Crayola fashion design kit that had no light box . My son has a lot of fun designing vehicles with this type of set , and he really loves the results . There are artistic tips in the included book , and the book also explains what different terms mean in case the user is n't a car nut who already knows them .	1
My 6 year old is obsessed with anything car related and he loves this . Works great . Really neat . Has lots of little pieces that I am sure will get lost over time but it would still work great then .	1
Gave this to son for Christmas and he immediately ( like that day ) started tracing out and coloring in the cars . He did it every day for two weeks straight . He would be up in his room or on the living room sofa or at his desk doing this for an hour straight . And he loved coloring different backgrounds ... starry night , mountains by day , a green forest rushing by . Very fun . Of everything he got for Christmas , this was probably his favorite gift .	1
My 5 1/2 year old son loves this . It is a bigger hit than I thought . He uses the vinyl clings to design his car . Then I trace it for him in sharpie . It 's fairly small so that 's why I help him with the tracing . Then he colors it with his own markers or the included pencils . The book that came with this set is extremely well-done . As an art teacher I highly recommend the book as it teaches shading techniques such as blending and highlighting with colored pencil . They teach how to do flames and lightning and have several examples you can follow to get you started.However , here is where I deduct one star . The clip is not easy to open . I have only been able to get the plastic under but not the plastic and the paper . On top of that the cars you are tracing are 1 inch bigger than the light table . So you will have to move it around anyway . The light table should be made larger . I would n't suggest the cars to go any smaller than they already are . The storage underneath is just placing the plastic tray the colored pencils came in underneath the light tray . But it is n't secure under there at all . This is such an awesome toy it should be designed just a tad better and it would be perfect .	1
I ordered these for my 13 year-old baby sitter , who loves owls . She loved them . They are very cute ! And the price was excellent .	1
Adorable little owls ... and so many sheets of stickers for this price ! These are perfect for decorating things with , for scrapbooks or just for rewarding a good little child !	1
You dont have to be an owl lover to fall in love with these cute big eyed little creatures . I am so excited to receive these in the mail so i can share them with the little ones at work and friends via the mail . an excelent product at a great price !	1
I paid about a dollar and a half for these adorable owl stickers . They are great for goody bags and for my toddler who has a voracious desire to stick endless amounts of stickers on paper . This is a great deal .	1
Excellent value for what you get ! My toddler is going through her love of stickers right now so we use them a lot ! These are about 1 1/2 inches by 1 1/2 inches per sticker in size.There are 9 stickers per sheet and you get 24 sheets.I have used these for crafts , cards , and halloween ( as an alternative to candy ) .I also purchased these other stickers by the same company and recommend them as well : Pirates StickersChristmas Stickers	1
These were really cute , I got for a friend who loves owls . There were so many little sheets I decided to use these on the kids chore board . If they had a really good day , instead of the normal star stickers they got an owl instead . When the line was filled up with stickers , each sticker would represent something ( little starts were worth 25 cents and the owls were worth a $ 1 ) , they loved to see an owl on their line .	1
I did n't realize there were so many in the package ! I am not sure how I will use all of these , but so far we 've had a lot of fun with them . Like another reviewer , I also hoped the stickers were diecut around the owl , but they are squares . That was kind of disappointing but not a huge deal .	1
Very cute , colorful stickers . Perfect for the back of cards and envelopes . Very quick arrival . I recommend ordering these stickers .	1
My Grand Daughter loves anything Owl and she will love these stickers ! I liked the price and its worth the money .	1
Great stickers but not quite what I was expected probably my fault for not reading more carefully I though this was an actual book	1
For the price , I think the stickers are adorable and they stick well . We have used them for craft projects for my young toddler . I would buy them again . I also thought the quantity was good for the price .	1
These are so colorful and cute . I used them for my daughters first birthday as party favors for an owl theme . They were perfect !	1
Cute stickers for toddlers . These are very small but a nice size to put inside birthday cards . Great price and value .	1
These cute little monster stickers were a perfect addition to my sons 2nd birthday monster bash party . They are small , maybe an inch per monster . The monsters also are n't cut out , so the sticker is square with the black that is around the monsters . Makes them easy to peel off tho .	1
Product arrive quickly and as expected . Would purchase this product again . The description given is very accurate . Would recommend this to a friend .	1
Adorable stickers but they are teeny tiny stickers . I must have missed the part of the description that started they were teeny tiny . For under $ 2 , I 'm fine with it .	1
How can anyone say no to a pack of cute monster stickers ? These will be on my list of things to buy in the near future . you cant beat this price either !	1
I got these stickers for my grand children - not necessarily for them but for ME ! LOL - I mail them little notes and I put these stickers on the note and on the envelopes . So cute and so worth the price of putting a big smile on the little faces . So cute ! It 's the little things in life that mean so very much .	1
It is a bargain to buy these ! I used them for my son & # 8217 ; s 2nd birthday party and we had so many leftover so my son still sticks them all over the place !	1
Excellent value for what you get ! My toddler is going through her love of stickers right now so we use them a lot ! These are about 1 1/2 inches by 1 1/2 inches per sticker in size.There are 9 stickers per sheet and you get 24 sheets.I have used these for crafts , cards , and halloween ( as an alternative to candy ) .I also purchased these other stickers by the same company and recommend them as well : Christmas StickersColorful Owls ( stickers ) Pirates Stickers	1
I really like that these are happy colorful monsters . There are so many sheets of them ! I keep them in my purse with a pad of paper and a pen for an emergency activity . I also gave them out at a monster baby shower to the kids who came .	1
Great stickers for the favors bags at my sons birthday party . The kids loved them and we had some left over .	1
Fun board game ! Your friends will love it . it has a deep underlaying story and great characters . You can even paint your own figures !	1
The mansions , figurines , cards , etc . are all artistically nice to see and helps with immersing yourself in the storyline . the variables that are possible also make it playable over and over several times.The only drawbacks I can tell are some minor glitches in some elements that I found sort of ridiculous . One such example , a manhole that was in the attic . There are a couple occasions where it does seem like there 's an impossible fight in overcoming some obstacles with certain time constraints . Also , this is game is quite time consuming in setup and playtime but worth it if you are a fan of the Cthulhu universe and the expansive details of the strategy .	1
The first thing to note about this game is that there are a lot of rules and a lot of pieces . If you plan on buying this game , investing in a crafts organizer would be helpful because there are a ton of different pieces , markers , and cards.The game consists of a Keeper who controls a lot of things that happen on the board , and a team of 1-4 players who play against the keeper , trying to complete a certain quest . The keeper tries to stop the players from completing their quest , which changes every time you play the game . For most of the game , the players are searching the board for clues as to what their quest will be . The keeper has a lot of actions and cards that can impede the players , but the game is fairly balanced . Usually the players will be able to last quite a while , and the keeper will be chipping away at them little by little the entire game . This may or may not be appealing to all people.Each game takes about 2-3 hours , and you 'll be looking in the rulebook constantly even after a couple games.All in all it 's a pretty fun game , but tedious to set up . Playing with the same people every time is recommended , because teaching this to new people will take a while .	1
The game is great fun and has a different feel than most boardgames or euro-games out there . The first couple reviews were very thorough and they are accurate in their praise . If you like boardgames and you like Cthulhu , you will like this game . If you also like Lovecraft , you will LOVE this game . It is very horror based , and while the investigators can choose combat options , there is a lot going on that is pure horror based that has nothign at all to do with shooting things . Sure , as the keeper , I can summon all sorts of nasties to try to kill the crew , but its so much more gratifying to slowly drive them all insane and have them do the job for me ! Very happy with the purchase .	1
Fantasy Flight Games ' & # 34 ; Mansions of Madness & # 34 ; is another wonderful addition to the company 's Cthulhu Mythos games . Like & # 34 ; Arkham Horror & # 34 ; before it , & # 34 ; Mansions of Madness & # 34 ; draws its inspiration from the haunted writings of H.P . Lovecraft . One player takes on the role of the Keeper , the evil entity battling with up to four investigators attempting to solve a mystery . The game play is a quite a bit of fun , and the game largely succeeds in generating a terror-filled story for the investigators to move through . It really is a lot of fun , but the downside is the enormous set-up time that comes with every game . When the Keeper sets up & # 34 ; Mansions of Madness , & # 34 ; he must carefully pay attention to a specific scenario set-up included with the game , but he must also make choices to customize that particularly game . This is a really cool mechanic . Unfortunately it really does take a long time to accomplish- every time . If the set-up time is not an issue , and it certainly is n't for me in the long run considering how much fun this game is , then you will no doubt enjoy this thrilling , horror-filled adventure .	1
For most board gamers , if you are a fan of FFG 's work , Arkham Horror , or Lovecraft in general , then you must get this game . For those who would enjoy a 1 vs 1-4 game , or a game heavy on moody theme , then this game is something you should look into . And even if you are not familiar with the theme but love lots of cool components like dice , tokens , cards , modular boards , and plastic miniatures , then this is also a game you should consider.One thing to note is that this game is a couple years old but that only means you have a chance now to get a less costly , refined gaming experience with the latest rule book revisions printed in the 2013 print of this game.The biggest issue here is that it has a long setup time and play time , but the experience is worth it . There are only 5 scenarios but each can be setup differently so replayability does not suffer , especially if different people take turns playing the Keeper , who is the team of one . This game shines best with 5 total players , but it auto-balances for fewer . Finally , this game has several expansions now which can improve your plays considerably .	1
I love the Lovecraftian universe and this game really showcases that well.One person plays as a sort of GM cllaed the Keeper.The other players play investigators trying to solve a mystery.There is a very extensive set-up , it took me about 45 minutes the first time to sort everything out and get it ready.But once it got going it was very fun ! It is a story driven game , and as the investigators find clues , the story expands and within the text will be a hint as to where the next clue it hidden.The combat is simple , the different checks are simple to perform.It can be a tough game due to the fact that the keeper is very strong , but you can overcome anything with teamwork and a lot of running.If you are a fan of the Lovecraftian world then this game will be a good choice.It is similar in style to Last Night On Earth . So that kind of gives you a play style comparison.For the price on Amazon it is well worth it.It will take a bit to learn and get used to it , but the play is very fun and being story driven , it just FEELS like an Arkham Horror game.The only gripe I have is that the minitaures are all just Grey and not painted . but that does n't really take away at all from the -play or feel . Plus I 'm sure I could always paint them.This is a buy for anyone who likes story , Lovecraft , and a fun game !	1
I own a huge variety of board games , and this one is clear and above the best one out there . This game is engaging and an instant classic for me and my friends . The character options are varied , and being the & # 34 ; keeper & # 34 ; is an absolute blast . The miniatures are excellent and the gameplay is very exciting and intense.Of all the Cthulhu mythos games out there , this one blows them all away .	1
Now is my grandson 's favorite of all his board games and he has many looking forward to all the expansions available	1
This game has some ups and downs , but for the most part it is fun to play . I 'll start with the positive aspects : - It is very unlikely that this game will be the same game twice . Actually , it 's pretty impossible.-When playing the game , it 's one person against everyone else . However , as the odd man out , with everyone else playing against you , you really do n't feel bad or left out because you get to do as much damage and cause as much trouble as possible ! You can really make the game difficult for those that are playing against you.Now the negatives , which really are n't so negative : -This game takes a LONG time to set up , especially the first time you play it . There are many many pieces , and both sides will constantly be referring to the very long instruction manuals . The first time we played this game , it took us 7 hours from the time we opened the box to the time we put the lid back on . Yeah , it took that long ! -Some of the directions are confusing , and there were a few times that we were n't sure if we were doing everything right . There is so much going on in this game , that it is a little difficult.If you do n't mind taking a while to play a game , this is actually a really fun game ! The story line is very in depth , and the monsters are intriguing . I ca n't wait to play with my family again !	1
This game requires at least two players , as it is based around the idea of a `` Game Master '' who is controlling everything not directly under the control of the other players , and investigators ( the other players ) .The board is composed of a series of tiles that can be configured to depict different houses - five plans are included in the game and more are coming in expansions.Each adventure involves the investigators searching the house for clues to the final objective ( unknown to them at the game start ) , then achieving that objective before the Game Master achieves his ( or hers ) .Along the way they may find items like axes or keys , and encounter locks and puzzles that must be solved before they can continue to explore that room.The Game Master has monsters he/she may deploy against the investigators in attempts to distract them and slow them down , and my cause them injury or madness , but is strictly limited because all his/her actions cost `` threat '' points which are in short supply ( typically one per investigator per turn ) .The key to successful play as an investigator is to listen carefully and read carefully - those clues are more than just colorful fluff.The key to successful play as the Game Master is in not wanting to win so badly the game becomes you versus them - you want to inculcate an `` us versus the menace '' atmosphere . By all means play for the win , just be cunning if you want the other players to come back for another game , as it is entirely in your hands as to the nature of the game experience the others have.Materials-wise the game is a celebration of excellence . The counters are the usual FFG high quality affairs , as are the tiles that make up the playing surface . The cards are in some cases a little small for my clumsy hands , but that is a failing in me , not the game . The plastic monsters and investigator figures are nice too , although the detail is in some cases less than it might be on a blister-pack figure . One of mine has a problem staying on the base , but I plan on modifying mine to use magnetic bases anyway , so I can paint them.The monsters are also represented by counters that are inserted into the plastic bases the models will clip to . On the back are the details of its special attack ( each individual of a given type will have a unique attack that is revealed only when called for , so the investigators never can be blas & eacute ; about meeting something they 've met before ) .Combat is performed by flipping cards until a given set of circumstances are met , which will call for a test against an investigator quality such as dexterity or marksmanship , or instruct the GM to use the special monster attack from the counter . It works well.FFg have made some serious effort to maintain playability here too.Players get to customize their investigators too , so the same character can be played a number of different ways , the details of the five adventures can be varied ( with impact to the seeded clues ) to give around a dozen variants of each game ( though the details of those variants may be moot is a clever investigator player follows the clues intelligently and gets a little lucky ) .The atmosphere of this game is very different as it plays than other Cthulhu Mythos games , which often lose steam as they relentlessly grind the players down . In this one the players have a very attractively presented game with the possibility of a win ( that alone is a rare thing for a Cthulhu Mythos game ) and engaging play.One downside is the lengthy set-up . If a would-be GM is playing a game the next day , it is worth bagging up the various rooms cards in individual bags , each with a label or note as to where this bag 's contents go on the map beforehand . Even so , be prepared for some initial dismay.It 's a little on the pricey side , but worth it I think . I 'm getting more game value from this in the first month of ownership than I 've gotten from my fully-loaded Arkham Horror set that I 've had for years , that I can tell you.I strongly recommend Mansions of Madness.I also offer this tip : Re-bagging and then trying to get everything back in the box is a major hassle and pain in the rear . Chessex offer clear counter transport and organization trays , and two of these will hold everything except the puzzle pieces . If you remove the card insert from the box and turn it upside-down , flattening out the `` trough '' , you will be able to put in the tiles , two stacked Chessex trays filled with organized counters and all the other bagged components without fear of anything poking up and getting bent or broken when the lid is fitted .	1
As soon as the box arrived from Amazon for Mansions of Madness , I knew it was high quality.Mansions of Madness is a game set in the same game world asArkham Horrorwhich is based on HP Lovecraft 's Cthulu Mythos.The first thing you will notice is the weight of the box . I was surprised that the packing slip claimed the package was 5 pounds , which means it has some heft to it.Upon opening the game you find 1/8 inch thick ( roughly ) cardboard punch outs for a variety of different game pieces and effects . Also included in these punch outs are the tiles that make up the different locations in the game , double sided for maximum efficiency , as in any of the 5 included scenarios you never need what 's on the other side of one of the tiles to complete the map.There are also 300 cards in 2 sizes included.More amazing is the fact that you receive plastic figurines of the 8 investigators in the game , plus 24 monster figurines . In terms of build quality , I would say the plastic is of a decent quality , though when setting the Mi-Go on its base , you should be careful as it is the only piece in the system that I felt I could potentially break because of the spindly leg you use to connect it to the base . The cool part is that the base is designed to accept a tile that gives you the pertinent information about the monster ( what you 'll need for a horror or evade check ) clearly visible without needing to keep the cardboard tiles lying around.I do have one complaint , which is a complaint I share with other Fantasy Flight Games offerings . I love the quality of the packaging and all the pieces . The one thing I ca n't stand ? It is n't really easy to return everything to the box . If you wish to keep the monsters on their bases , every time you stop playing you need to set aside an extra 10 minutes to try and strategically place the monsters with bases . And more often than not , as the monsters are n't really firmly attached to the base ( they make them easy to assemble/disassemble ) , many will fall off just by moving the box around . The other issue is that with all the various tokens and cards , there is no simple way to keep everything separate , which really would help in cutting down the setup time it takes to get the game ready to play . I 've purchased 2 plastic cases with little compartments in them to keep my Arkham Horror stuff separate and will need to do the same with Mansions of Madness . With a little more planning there may have been a way for Fantasy Flight Games to configure the box for easier setup , though my guess is this would raise the cost of an already higher-than-normal board game price.So what 's the game all about ? This is a cooperative game where you have one person being The Keeper , that is , the `` bad guys '' and the rest of the players being investigators on the side of good . Up to 5 people can play for a total of 4 investigators and 1 Keeper.The players decide what scenario , or story , to play . There are only 5 scenarios included in the package , though each scenario has The Keeper making 3-6 decisions that alter the way the game is configured , setup , played and even completed for a lot of potential variation.In terms of setup , in your first couple of games you really need to set aside about 20-40 minutes to sift through tokens , cards and other assorted pieces before you are ready to play . Once you have everything configured , anticipate a full game to run you at least 90 minutes , generally more like 2 full hours . It all depends again on the luck of the draw and roll of the die.There is a general rule book with a good overview on how to play the game , then also included on the flip side of this book ( meaning you flip the book over and upside down ) is the information investigators need to setup the different scenarios for themselves . Investigators build the Mansion to the specifications in the scenario they are playing ( outlined in the investigator book ) while The Keeper , who has a The Keeper specific book , builds the clues in the rooms to the specifications of the scenario . The only thing I do n't like about this setup is that if you want to read the general rules you have to keep the book within reach which may impede the investigators from reading their side of the scenario during play since the book is designed to allow easy access to one side or the other . Of course , if you want you can always print the rule book up ( available on FFG 's website , linked to in the comments attached to my review ) to have them available this way if you so choose . Having the rules available as a PDF is awesome as well , as you wo n't wear out the main rule book this way . Too bad they do n't yet offer The Keeper book nor the investigator book as a PDF , as if you play often enough you will wear these books out also.Investigators receive 2 movement and one action per turn which allows them to explore the Mansion to discover clues . As the investigators progress and they gather the main clues that continue the plot , they must also face off against The Keeper who has a lot of ways to keep them from discovering these clues . They will combat monsters , face horrors and even need to solve puzzles to get one step closer to the objective.Why do I keep calling it `` the objective ? '' Simply because the terms of winning , for the investigators or The Keeper , vary from game to game depending on the pick of the cards.How complex is it to play this game ? Compared to Arkham Horror , this game is like Candy Land ! OK , not really THAT much less complex , but there are far less rules to remember , far less checks to be made and I 'd say it 's a lot easier for the investigators to win this over Arkham Horror . If you 've never played Arkham Horror and generally do n't play games outside of say , Risk or similar , this will seem more complex . I would say overall it is a medium/intermediate difficulty level to play and really learn . Age range for someone to REALLY be able to enjoy the game would probably be 13 to 200+ years old . Any child that is 10+ and bright for the age can probably enjoy it too.Overall this is a really fun game to play , especially with more people.What 's not to like about the game ? Five scenarios seems limiting to me . Sure , each scenario has different questions The Keeper can choose , which changes the layout and the way the story unfolds , but in the end it really is only five scenarios . I 'm sure , given Fantasy Flight Games ' love of expansions , that there will be expansions to come , which I 'm perfectly OK with , I just hope they can give those that wish to limit their costs a way to purchase a few more scenarios that use just the pieces in the main box and do n't require a person to shell out another $ 80 ( MSRP ) for another box of only 5 scenarios . Though I suppose it is also possible they will do standalone expansions as well , which can also work , though I 'd prefer to see them maximize the original set as well with less expensive smaller expansions.This game is quite similar to Betrayal at House on the Hill with a few exceptions . If you 've played either of these games and go to play the other , they are n't all that dissimilar but each is fun in its own way . One big difference with Mansions of Madness is that there is no betrayal involved as the antagonist is chosen at the start of the game and is not random . The board setup is also not random as it is in Betrayal . Of course , both vaguely remind me of Mystery Mansion ( I grew up in the 80s ) from Milton Bradley . And who knows , perhaps there was something prior to Mystery Mansion as well that it was based off of ? If you own Betrayal should you buy Mansions ? If you like Betrayal and would like to play with just 2 people instead of the 3 minimum , go for it . And if you 're a fan of Lovecraft or Arkham Horror , buying this is a no brainer . If you only like Betrayal , you probably wo n't love Mansions and could skip it.I , for one , have thoroughly enjoyed both games . I like little pieces better in one over the other , but neither has anything that tips the scale . If I have less time to play , Betrayal is the game that comes out to play as games are shorter and setup is much , much faster . If I have 2+ hours available to play , Mansions always comes out first.ALSO BE AWARE , there are some errata corrected since the game was sent to be published ( excluding even the small sheet of errata included in the game box that also includes replacement cards for the offending cards ) . I 've included a link in the comments of this review to the most up to date errata sheet available.Five stars because in the end , I really enjoy playing this game . I 'd always pick Arkham Horror over this if given the option , but sometimes you are n't looking for something THAT complex to play .	1
I bought this for a family Christmas gift and we love it . It is a complex game but after 1-2 rounds of play you 'll have it down . It comes with excellent characters and story lines . The monster figurines are my husband 's favorite part . We 'll be ordering expansions for this game soon because we 've loved it so much .	1
I have played many many many of these 60+ piece games and have really had fun and have really regretted many of the purchases . This one is a keeper . I played it with my bro and his 13 year old son ( who is a pretty smart kid ) . We all understood the rules well and I was very surprised at how unique it is to play each time , yet with very adequate balance . We all had fun and we all look forward to getting together soon to play again .	1
Grab a bunch of friends ( or just yourself ) , choose your characters , choose the GOO and get ready to cooperatively thwart the transdimensional invasion of one bad mamma jamma monster and its cohorts ! Use your yahtzee skills to defeat monsters and conquer the adventure cards . Gather enough elder sign tokens to keep the GOO ( Great Old One ) from ripping through to our world , but the clock is always ticking down , ticking down to your doom ! I have to admit that I am a sucker for Lovecraftian themed anything so this is definitely not an objective review . You roll dice trying to get combinations of symbols on the dice that correspond with whatever adventure card you are trying to complete . If you get the right combination you win that card and get the spoils or fail and reap the consequences ! Pros -- With a wide variety of characters , GOOs and adventure cards you will never play the same game twice-Cooperation and cheering each other on as you roll the dice-The clock mechanism that keeps you on your toes as each day goes by things get worse-A lite and fairly quick jaunt in world savingCons -- It can be frustrating when you ca n't seem to roll what you need time after time-The theme is quite lite and can feel like it 's not quite enough after playing other Lovecraftian gamesOverall this is an enjoyable game and I am always willing to play it !	1
I purchased this game after watching it played on Tabletop on the Geek and Sundry youtube channel . It can be a little daunting when you first set it up but is easier to play than it looks . I really like that it supports up to 8 players as we have a large group of friends that game together . It can be hard to find good quality games that support more than 4-6 players and many of the ones that do can become tedious waiting for your turn.On our first time playing we got our butts kicked , but we still had a great time .	1
For those who enjoy dice rolling games ( like King of Tokyo ) and also want to combine the Cthulhu mythos for a cooperative fight against Ancient Ones , this game fits the bill . Theoretically can play 1-8 , but shines best with 1-4 given the potential downtime between turns since players take turns alternately instead of simultaneously .	1
Having never played Arkham Horror or Mansions of Madness , I will review this game based solely on its own merit , not a comparison as most people have done . That being said , I have seen AH and MoM played at conventions , and they seem really complex with lots of things to keep track of . This game , however , is pretty simple , perhaps too simple for some . This really is just Yatzee Chthulhu , thats a pretty good name for it . Luckily , I love Yatzee and I love H.P . Lovecraft , so this was an instant success in my house . What I really like about this game is that adults and kids can play it together and can both have fun for different reasons . The adults can pretend to be hunting monsters , while the kids can enjoy finally being able to play one of `` Daddy 's Games '' without having to have their hand held the entire time.Another thing I like about , is the rules can be tweeked . Having too much trouble , hand out some extra clues or spell cards . Too easy , add some extra doom tokens . There really is no reason to bash this game on the rules when you can easily change them and make the game better . My only gripe is the lack of diversity of your items . You get Spells , Unique Items , Common Items , and Allies , but they all basically allow you to do the same things . So , my question is , why bother with all the different kind of cards , why not just have an items pile , with all those mixed in , like Last Night on Earth ? Bottom line , enjoyable , but slightly flawed .	1
I initially saw this played on Wil Wheaton 's `` TableTop '' web series on YouTube and thought `` Huh , that looks kinda fun . '' A friend bought it and three of us have played it 10 times now and LOVE IT . The rules are a tiny bit arcane at first , but once you play through the game once , it becomes second-nature . There 's a LOT of strategy concerning which adventures to attempt when , whether to use your items to get the extra red or yellow dice , whether to hold symbols on spells for your friends to use , etc.Warning : the game , much like Arkham Horror , is designed to beat you . Our current split is 4/6 win/loss and in all but one of those wins we were really close to losing . My favorite part of the game is not only the challenge you have beating it , but that it 's a cooperative game like Pandemic or Castle Panic ; that is , the players vs. the game . Some of my friends are n't very competitive-minded , so playing an adversarial game is n't always fun for them . With Elder Sign , there 's no competition between players , which they like.The game plays fairly quickly when you 're familiar with the rules ; around 40 minutes per game . The materials are very high quality , with cards printed on heavy stock and laminated like playing cards . The tokens are all thick paperboard and also laminated . This game should last a long time with normal care . And since there 's no game board to worry about , you could consolidate everything into a box 1/4 of the size of the game box and play it pretty much anywhere.Overall , a great game that has a ton of replay value . This is one that I 'll be sure to keep in our regular game-night rotation !	1
Elder Sign is a fun Lovecraftian based game . It is a dice based game ( so frustrating at times ! ) and also cooperative , which is something I like a lot.It is definitely themed well to the Arkham universe , lots of flavor text and it has a cool look to me.The basically plays that you pick a card , or `` room '' , and you try to beat it by getting certain things on the dice . Win or lose there is something that happens , whether it be good or bad . A spell or a doom token ( bad ) .The goal of the game is to get a certain number of Elder Signs to lock the big baddie away , or if the big baddie gets anough doom tokens , he either destroys the world , or you fight him and see if you win or lose.The game is pretty tough , but it is fun.It is n't my favorite co-op game , and I do n't get to play to often as my girlfriend dislikes it.We both much prefer Mansions of Madness to Elder Sign.I say get it if you like Lovecraftian stuff and want a co-op game . But it is n't for everyone.I like it myself . It 's better with a fun group of people rather than 1 or two people.If you wan na see it played , watch the episode of it on Tabletop , Geek and Sundry youtube channel .	1
This is probably one of the better dice rolling games out there . They have just enough mechanics in the game to change the random nature of dice into a not-quite-as-random set of parameters that make for an enjoyable game . this game has the unique feature of letting you have as many or as few players as you want to play , making it an easy pick up and play game.My only complaint is the game is not very balanced , some investigators are clearly better than others , and some cards are mind blowingly difficult to defeat due to the random nature of dice .	1
The game comes in a sturdy box with good quality tokens , cards and dice ( even though it 's made in China ) . Good re playability vale . The theme is good , and the game does not take long to finish once you get the hang of it . ( max 60 min , win / loose ) . Great game to play solo too , and so far I have beaten the game twice and lost half a dozen times , but it 's still fun to play ( unlike the Death Angel : Space Hulk card game , which has less than 20-30 % chance of winning , but that another review : ) ) .	1
Complex but a wonderful game . Saw it on Tabletop with Wil Wheaton ( on Geek & Sundry ) and it was amazing . Love playing with my husband and my sister . Takes a while to figure out strategy - definitely not a quick game to pick up and play - but excellent for board game lovers .	1
Whats great about Elder Signs is it is easy for people who are n't hardcore gamers to get into it . It is a great gateway into the Arkham universe . I am a total board game geek and most of my friends and family are n't . I have n't had a hard time getting anyone into this game , and most ca n't wait to play it again ! !	1
The theme is amazing and has pretty solid mechanics . Because it is a dice game luck plays a large part which can make it quite difficult , I 'd say I 've won less than 50 % of the games I 've played . Then again , you are fighting against an Elder God .	1
It you love difficult game , cultists , and Chtulhu mythos , this game is for you ! Look for clues , defeat monsters and try to save the world in time !	1
I saw this product on the YouTube Show , Tabletop with Wil Wheaton and it did n't disappoint ! Fun for the whole gang !	1
easy and fun cards will win over your game night guests ! it takes the minds of an imaginitive group to really bring out the game 's best but can be for any age group easily or mixed . Cthulu has this to fear .	1
The game play on this well made and beautifully illustrated co-op game is fun , but not too labor/rules intensive . This is a great game for when my D & D group is short a few players and we want to pass a few hours while we talk about nerdy stuff and do n't want to be bothered with more complicated games . I suppose that I could complain that the strategy elements are not as important as the luck of the dice rolls , but that is pretty much what I expected , so I am not penalizing the game and I am awarding full marks . The pieces are cardboard , but nice quality and printed on both sides . The cards have a nice feel and the artwork is great . This game went beyond my expectations , and I have even played it a few times by myself ( not as fun as with friends , but it keeps my hands busy while I watch TV ) .	1
Fun coop game . The rules can be hard to understand but after a couple plays the game makes more sense . fun for groups or just 2 player coop .	1
Elder Sign is one of my favorite games I 've played in the past year . This game is for sure not for every one but for anyone looking to spice up a weekly board game night or to start collecting new a different games , Elder sign is a great choice.Because this game is cooperative you 'll find the atmosphere very different from other games . Working together as a team is KEY in Elder Sign , if you do n't you 're sure to fail . There are a lot of different rules in the game but in the end this game is basically a supernatural yahtzee . Your goal is to rule various dice combinations while attempting to prevent a Lovecraftian creature from rising and destroying the world.If you get this game do not fret if your first attempt at this game is confusing . You will stumble , you will forget rules , and you probably will either lose miserably or win because you misunderstood how the game works ( what happened to my gaming group ) . Once the rules are grasped , you 'll find this game is one you 'll want to come back to constantly.With so many character options , monsters and varying circumstances , you 'll find this game has GREAT replay ability .	1
What else can I say but tentacle , tentacle , tentacle.It 's a great game to play with people who are not competitive because it is the group versus the game . Very fun , highly addictive and always on our short list of games to play during our weekly gaming seasons .	1
Elder Sign is a great way to kill an hour or so.Someone on YouTube reviewed this game and called it `` The Yahtzee '' of horror games . I 'm not sure that 's true , but I can see some similarities with all the dice rolling and matching of the results.The game play on `` Elder Sign '' is great , because most people I know , enjoy rolling dice and no overly complicated rules or pontificating of strategies . Once you learn the rules , `` Elder Sign '' is between 30-60 minutes . You match dice with emblems and use special cards to do things . Because your main goal is to close a gate from hell or some other horror-like plane . This game was based upon the most popular game `` Arkham Horror '' and the game does n't take a ton of time or set-up ( like `` Arkham Horror '' ) . There is a ton of people who prefer `` Elder Signs '' to `` Arkham Horror '' though because it 's much simpler.The pieces are of great quality and could last a long time , especially if your not hard on your game . The artwork is some of the best images , colors , etc etc ... of any board game I have ever seen . Honestly I love the art on it ... . phenomenal ! The box is perfect and good quality . It comes with plastic bags and the cards have a nice texture to them . The dice have symbols on them and have nice rounded corners that make rolling pleasant ( so they do n't stop too early ) .I also LOVE the theme . I enjoy novels and stories of the macabre ( or `` dark themes '' ) and Elder Signs is like that . Inspired on Lovecraft 's horror stories , the game has this feel . `` Arkham Horror '' is more immersible and you feel more involved , than Elder Signs , but on the whole it 's great . I would warn and suggest , do not go through the motions on this game . Read through each card and piece and think about what the situation and circumstances of your characters are . It really helps make the game way more enjoyable . Just rolling picking , rolling picking will make the game a slog and not fun.My ONLY complain is this ; I desire more of the game ... more meat ... more of it in general . It 'd be more fun , to do more research and more discovery on why the monsters are there , and why the situation is so dark and crazy in this facility . I guess `` Arkham Horror '' is the solution , because I love that game too . For most people though , `` Elder Sign '' is a better choice because of it 's quick play and you still get a dip into the theme without spending days to complete it.Overall though , I am happy with my purchase , and wow ... the games theme and art is completely and simply awesome.Enjoy !	1
This is the slightly less complicated version of Arkham Horror . Think of it as a kind of Lovecraftian Yahtzee - you roll dice to defeat monsters and occurrences in the rooms of a museum , trying to build up a collection of 'elder signs ' that can be used to seal away a great evil . It 's not too difficult to win if at least one of the players knows the rules . There is plenty of replay value as there are tons of random rooms and dimensions to battle in , as well as monsters.There is also an excellent iOS version of this game that I highly recommend , too .	1
Elder sign by Fantasy Flight Games is a really fun game ! The artwork is well designed and the game requires a few minutes of easy set up but can be played anywhere due to the lack of a board . The rules are easy to follow , and if you can roll dice you can play Elder Sign . Each game is unique which is why we love it so much . The collection of & # 34 ; missions & # 34 ; allows you to play a new game each time you take it out of the box which gives this game some longevity as far as playability in the long run . One of the other nice things is you can play it alone , or with several others . It makes for a great family game with anyone from i 'd say age 12 and up . Great and affordable way to start your game nights too !	1
The game features the standard high-quality artwork and card components that we 've come to expect from FFG , though some of the components are a little small.If you 've played Arkham Horror you 'll find characters you know and love as choices for PCs , and the parts and mechanics will be familiar.Briefly , the conceit of the game is that you and the other players are in a museum attempting to resolve `` adventures '' by completing `` tasks '' in order to prevent `` The Ancient One '' from awakening ( and presumably destroying Life As We Know It as they always are assumed to want to do ) .The object of the game is to collect enough Elder Sign tokens that the Big Bad Monster goes back to sleep , before its Doom Track fills with Doom Tokens . The exact number of each depends on the Ancient One chosen for the game . Yig wakes up very quickly but requires fewer Elder Signs to beat , Shub-Niggurath takes a while longer and requires more Elder Signs.So first items on the agenda : How do Doom Tokens get added to the track ? Events call for them.And how do I get Elder Signs ? As named rewards for completing adventures.Next up then : How do events happen ? Every four turns as the clock strikes midnight.And how do I resolve adventures ? By completing tasks.Right . How do I complete tasks ? One at a time , by rolling 6 green dice to match a string of 1 to 4 ( usually ) symbols.What happens if I fail to complete a task ? You remove one die from the pool and try again . There might be another effect depending on the card and whether you rolled the `` terror '' result or not.What happens if I do n't have enough dice to finish a task ? You fail to resolve the task and the adventure , and take adventure-dependent penalties like SAN loss , HEALTH loss and so on.Egad ! What happens if I run out of SAN or HEALTH ? You are devoured , lose all your stuff including your collected Elder Signs and must grab a new character for yourself to use next turn . The loss of the Elder Signs is particularly nasty for the group as a whole.Can I get SAN and/or HEALTH back ? Yes , by using certain items , personal powers or by spending trophies gained by completing adventures and killing monsters.What happens if the Ancient One awakens ? You all fight it using the Doom Tokens as its hit points until either it is out of Doom Tokens or you are all devoured.What other factors are there ? Common Items that - usually - add a yellow die to the pool which features a different set of possible results increasing the number of `` investigation '' results possible.Unique Items that - usually - add a red die to the pool which has a wildcard or `` joker '' face on it.Spells that -usually - allow you to freeze dice for your turn.Clue tokens that allow re-rolling.Monsters that change or add tasks to adventures.Other World adventures that feature fabulous rewards and terrible peril.The ability to `` focus '' after a failed task and freeze one of the `` failed '' dice.Unplanned clock advancement.Oh , and the locking ( and this removal from play ) of the red or yellow dice by adventure cards or monsters , which can become very , very old very fast.That 's about it.Sounds simple . And the rulebook ? Horribly organized with no index , the usual state of affairs for FFG - expect confusion in your first game.Is it fun ? Well now , that is a poser . If played simply as a `` read the card , roll the dice '' game , not so much . If played as a `` Read the card aloud in character , and resolve the tasks '' affair , more so . I have this , Arkham Horror and Mansions of Madness . It is by far the simplest of the three , but the game play is , I think , the least rewarding.Yes it 's fun , but the fun wears off rather quickly . It is a highly tactical game in that there is considerable scope for deciding how one will cope with particularly difficult tasks ( ie unlikely dice results ) - will you rely on clues to get you re-rolls or will you use spells to freeze dice and bias your chances that way , and when do you use your ( one-shot ) items and spells to save the day ? There is also the tiresome need to back off and heal occasionally by retiring to the museum entrance . If this sort of thing annoys you , this game is not for you.Can I play it solo ? Yes you can . The Ancient One combat is scaled for different numbers of players just like it is in Arkham Horror . [ EDIT - the `` Cthulhu Yahtzee '' thing ] Is Elder Sign really `` Cthulhu Yahtzee '' ? Although that is a popular soundbitey name for Elder Sign , no , not really . The resemblance ends with rolling dice to get results . The mechanics of actually assembling those dice into the results required in the time given are quite different.For example : Each new attempt to complete a task ( get a given result to show ) requires a roll of all dice unless you can focus one die and/or freeze dice using spells etc , and each attempt costs one die to make after the first . Not only that , there are penalties for rolling certain results on the dice that reduce the chances to finish a given task . Also : those spells are one-shot , use 'em and lose 'em affairs , so a player has to balance the need to complete a task with the need to conserve heavy artillery for the really tricky tasks to come.Yahtzee players can leave whatever they like on the table at will and build on that roll and always roll the all the available dice . Take three rolls to make ( say ) three fives and you roll all the dice until your turn is up or you have three fives . Take three rolls to make three `` Investigation '' rolls and you are probably rolling four or fewer dice on roll three , and may have seriously depleted your stock of magic into the bargain . [ /EDIT ] Moans : FFG let themselves down with their rulebooks time and time again . This game is not complex , but seems so in the first couple of goes because of the art-heavy , organization-light nature of the rules . The first game kicked up a bunch of odd situations that had me snarling as I took time off the fun of the game to wade perplexedly through the rules looking for insight . Case System , lads . Hypertext for paper.The box is smaller than the standard FFG box too , which means that a Chessex counter tray wo n't fit without being cut in two . Not only that , because the box is shallower than usual with respect to the overall dimensions , the card insert can not be turned upside-down to provide space for the cut-up trays ( so much better than baggies for organization , transport and inventory checking post-game ) and so you are in a baggie or discard the insert position.Conclusion : If you enjoy the theatrics of games with a narrative element ( such as `` Gloom '' ) this game should tickle your fancy . It is a mythos game that you can win and which does n't send you penniless onto the streets to be devoured in game turn two like Arkham Horror seems so often to do . I do n't think it can be played all afternoon , but then I do n't think that was what was intended . I throw it into my game bag as a stand-by game .	1
my son is a gamer and this is a great game for him to add to his collection . Will make a great gift .	1
I love board games . We played this one three times through the very first time . You 'll love the quality of the pieces and art . The press your luck feel really adds to the drama . Lots of fun .	1
This game really hit the mark for in a lot of different areas . It has really nice art work , cool plastic miniatures , play is fast and exciting , and the rules are clearly written . The board is really nice , and well designed . The rule book was easy to understand and walk through to figure out the game . The rules themselves are pretty simple and easy to teach ( always a big consideration for me , since I usually am the one teaching the game to others ) . The games do n't take too long or bog down , and there is a great tension between escaping the pyramid or sticking around to try and gather more , but risking getting trapped inside . I would recommend this as a fun family game or as a light break between more intense games , if you have a serious gaming group .	1
I just finished playing my first ever game of Adventurers : Pyramid of Horus , with my two six year old twin boys , my nine year old boy , my thirty year old brother and his thirty one year old friend . Why do the ages matter ? Because every single one of us had an absolute blast from six years old all the way up to the thirties . When the game first started off it went at a medium pace but as each round came to a close and another block dropped into the pyramid , blocking the path out , things really began to heat up ! The frantic balance between going further into the pyramid for one more treasure versus playing it safe and staying close to the exit for small treasure is perfect . My six year old boys understood the rules and with minimal help were able to manage their own turns . I just ca n't say enough about how fun and exciting this game was . The quality of the board , miniatures , cards and accessories was top notch but I expect nothing less from Fantasy Flight games . By the time the dust settled the entire family had laughed , yelled , jumped out of our seats , shouted with joy and had the greatest fun with a board game we 've had in a long time . I highly recommend this game to all ages , if you can handle a little excitement and adventure that is !	1
This is a very simple game which is really good for a younger audience . I bought it to add to my fantasy flight game collection , I enjoyed it but would only desire to play if I was playing with very younng players .	1
I bought this game to my nephew and when we played was incredible ! ! ! ! The game is very smart and teaches strategy ! ! ! It 's very important for childrens to have fun learning ! ! !	1
The set up is a little tedious but the components and game play are great ! The pieces are durable and adorable and the game itself requires a lot of strategy and thinking.Great for all ages and levels .	1
This is a fun game , however it has a lot of instructions that are a little complicated . It requires an adult to help the kids get started .	1
Hey That 's My Fish is without question the easiest game I own . That being said , it is still quite fun and has a surprising depth of strategy.In the game players will take control of a group of penguins . The number of penguins each player get changes based on the number of players ( 4 for a 2 player , 3 for a 3 player , 2 for a 4 player ) .The penguins will be placed on hexagonal tiles that have 1-3 fishes . On your turn you will move a penguin in a straight line any direction as far as you want , with the caveat being you can not jump over other penguins or empty spaces . Whatever space you were on initially you will pick up and add to your collection.That 's all it is . Its a tactical game where you 're trying to figure out ways to get the most fish while limiting your opponents . it allows for some clever maneuvering with very minimal rules . Children as young as 5 could probably grasp the idea , possibly younger , while adults will find enough strategy here to be entertained .	1
I 'd heard of Hey ! That 's My Fish for a couple years , but the price always kind of scared me off , so when I found it for $ 10 I figured I had to get it since it is both very easy to travel with and has penguins ( two things that I look for but hardly seem to find in board games ) .I am very happy with HTMF because of how easy it is to play , and yet how deep the strategy can be when playing . Do you go for the big fish or will that allow your opponent to trap you out of a larger point value ? Gameplay is very simple . You have a shrinking iceflow made up of little Hexagon tiles . On your turn you move a penguin from the tile it 's on to any other tile in a straight line on the board . You ca n't hop over empty spaces , you ca n't hop over other penguins . When you land you then take the space you started on as Victory Points for the end of the game . If a penguin is completely isolated and ca n't be moved any further ( standing on a space with no pieces around it ) it is removed from play . That 's all there really is to know , one short paragraph , with a few extra thrown in for rules clarifications and demonstrations . Really Easy to teach , really easy to learn , very fun to play.I 'd say this is easily one of the best purchases of the past year , it 's fast , it 's fun and the plastic penguins are fantastic . And the size makes is easy to take anywhere . This is always going with me on trips , it even fits in my jacket pocket , but I have big pockets .	1
Really easy to teach and learn . Pieces are a bit on the small side so tiny hands might mess up arranging them . An adult needs to put the pieces down first . The pieces all need to be face up so that the fish are showing . After that , each player takes a turn moving , then removing a fish . It 's pretty simple , but kids get very excited . You need to prepare them for getting stuck and not moving the rest of the game , but most kids do n't seem to have a problem with this as they have multiple playing pieces . Again , fun and easy .	1
This is the updated Fantasy Flights version of HTMF . This game portrays you as a hungry penguin on the hunt for tasty fish . In doing so you must round up your fish before any rival penguins claim it for their own . Your game board per se consist of 40 hexagonal tiles and always changes . Some might complain that this takes awhile to set up , but if you have some help with your other player ( s ) set up is a breeze . Fantastic game , great price and best of all the WIFE loves it !	1
My family is n't much into games with the exception of rummy and other card games . This means that I usually struggle to get any member of my family to try any of the games I bring with me when we are going to get together.However , when I described this one my sister was willing to allow her children ( 8 and 6 ) to try it . There was a bit of a problem getting my 6 year old niece to understand how things go , and neither of the children did a good job of looking and planning ahead , but both loved the game and immediately wanted to play again.The game itself is so simple its almost scary . Setup takes only a few minutes and game play is straightforward , with no dice or cards involved . I managed to teach a 6 year old how to play and while the strategy might confuse her , she still had a wonderful time.This is a great gateway game or one for a quiet afternoon when no one wants to have to think while playing a game . I definitely recommend this one .	1
I wo n't concentrate on reviewing the game which many had done a wonderful job . It 's simply Great.The down side is it 's tedious to set up the game & picking them up when you moved.There 's an alternative from the makers . The game on android app & it 's cheaper too . play great on a tablet ! Fantasy Flight Games Thats FishFor me the electronics copy is a good way to play on the go	1
My 6/7 year old really liked this game . It kept him busy to the end . I believe we will be playing this one often . So , I do recommend this game.Make sure you put on a nice flat surface because you have to line the blocks of ice evenly .	1
Hey That 's My Fish plays quickly ( ~5 mins ) . Some say that it takes longer to setup than to play but I have n't found that to be true . You 're trying to collect the most fish while keeping your opponent from collecting fish . With the kids it 's a sweet game that they can easily grasp . But with the adults it turns into a backstabbing take-that slugfest . It 's awesome . A great addition to any collection .	1
Again a awesome quality game by fantasy flight . Fantasy flight has really won me over and is my favorite game company . This game has awesome components and is very fun yet tricky to master . The game is a bit annoying to set up due to all the tiles but after that its pretty fun . The only thing that keeps this from getting 5 stars is the same thing that keeps fantasy flight games from being perfect , the box insert . I know they have said that it keeps cost down but many other company 's have awesome inserts and do n't cost that much . I would gladly pay 5-7 more dollars for some kind of insert . It 's just molded plastic ! C'mon fantasy flight ! !	1
Easy game to teach the family with quick play . Quickly hem in the competition to see who gets the most fish .	1
A dungeon crawler that is designed well . This is n't D & D ; you ca n't compare it to that but that being said some of the mechanics are similar to it . There are no opportunity hits if you walk by monsters like D & D . ; It is a lot of fun I 'm a new player and have only played the introduction so far but ca n't wait to move to the first quest in the campaign . This comes with some fantastic quests and it will take a long time to go through them all . You can also download user created quests online which is great for the replay value of the game . This game consistently gets good reviews -- check boardgamegeek . You ca n't go wrong buying it.The only CON I would give is that the rulebook is lacking a few things that my wife and I are still trying clarify .	1
This is an Excellent game to play.. To get into this game I recommend you watch a video to see how its played . Once you play thru a game its not complicated . Fun to go thru the dungeon and explore , lots of scenarios to play thru.. I would recommend Descent : Journeys in the Dark Second Edition..	1
This game is what helped me pull my 12 & 13yo sons away from the XBOX and play board games with me on a regular basis . Having liked Skyrim on the XBOX , they understood the theme immediately and really wanted to do the campaign style playing . Though is can be played not as a campaign , I am not really sure why you would n't . I play the Overlord . We have just about finished & # 34 ; Act 1 & # 34 ; . I have won about 75 % of the time , but they still enjoy it and I have too . Not too easy , not too hard , though some scenarios do really seem to favor one side over the other . I suspect we will keep playing in this until done and then buy the expansions .	1
Take my review with a grain of salt since I have n't played through a whole campaign but what I do know is- A lot of minis and a variety of them . Do n't let the red/white scheme scare you away- Lots of good quality cardboard and cards . Colorful art.- Essentially a tactical miniatures fantasy game of 1 vs 2-4- Meant to be played as a campaign and requires a dedicated group of consistent gamers- Fair amount of setup time needed , but well worth it.- Not a dungeon crawl / exploration since both sides have goals to pursue.- Lots of small and large expansions which can use up your savings but do not require any expansions to have a good game.If you are okay with all of the above then this game is for you .	1
Descent : Journeys in The Dark Second Edition Board Game maybe should have been named something different because it is a little misleading . The second edition is so streamlined compared to the first , I find it to be a completely different game . Our group still plays both for different reasons . If you want a quicker dungeon crawler game that if very easy to setup and teach , play second edition . If you want a more in depth dungeon crawler with lots of options that will take 3-4 hours play first edition . Personally I like the First edition game better , but as I said they are so different both games still get played .	1
I purchased this game as a kind of & # 34 ; D & D ; in-a-box & # 34 ; purchase to play with friends , and it was a big hit.Pros : Lots of characters and class options-The adventures are fun and engaging-Easy to learn-Excellent miniatures and artCons : -Fairly basic as far as gameplay goes , not alot of thought involved.-Campaigns are artificially stretched by the & # 34 ; reinforcement & # 34 ; mechanic that lets you constantly add more enemies to the stage-Requires someone to be the & # 34 ; overlord & # 34 ; which no one wants to be .	1
I am really enjoying playing this game . When I first heard about descent they were no longer in print . Later hearing about the second edition I was very excited.The production is excellent and the rules although a bit much at first are quite easy to learn . They are even easier to teach to someone . Weapons , spells and overload powers are really fun . The art work on the tile sets allows you to be fully taken into the experience.Games are also around an 1-2 hours and are nicely broken up into two acts for making it easier for groups with time constraints.If you are into dungeon board games , then his is for you .	1
This game is great ! I 've never played the original Descent , so I do n't have anything to compare to but I can imagine how streamlined this version has to be . The game play is very fun and the artwork on the board , cards , and everything is great . The miniatures look amazing too . I 'm looking forward to collecting the rest of the expansions for it and hope to get this game out on the table often .	1
My grandson is really into these board games and he loved it ! ! I also got him the extension ! ! He has so many ! !	1
I had Descent Version 1 . I played it never . The rules were complex , the modifiers were complex and hundreds of tokens existed for it . All I wanted to do was go into a dungeon , fight monsters and get treasure . This game does that in such a simple and elegant way that I really appreciate . It de-clutters the box and simplifies the instructions . There are less counters and the battles are streamlined . I appreciate where Fantasy Flight is going with their games . You can tell they put thought into making there games fun and streamlining where possible . I know that some people like the numbers crunching and that 's fine , but for most , it 's a turn off . This game is dungeon exploring at its best , in a box !	1
I have never played 1st edition of Descent but always wanted to . Sadly , the time to play a game of descent was said to spread from 3-6 hours . Now , second edition comes out and it can easily be played within 1-3 hours . On top of that there are 16 quests to go on ! I love how Fantasy Flight Games come out with great games and never skimp out on the quality . This is a great game for players who were always curious about Descent , it plays well and the instructions are easily learned . I would highly recommend the Conversion kit as well . This adds more monsters and heroes into your game , but does not include the miniatures . Love this game !	1
I did n't think it was possible to make Descent more enjoyable then it was . The only thing wrong with 1st edition of this game was the length it took to play . It was very hard to get people to either try it or commit to playing a full game . This is the edition to have it cuts play times down dramatically with out losing what was so great about the first game .	1
My gaming group and I played the first edition of Descent a lot , including the Road to Legend campaign all the way through a couple of times . When this second edition came out , the logical thing to do was to buy it . I 'm pleased to say that it not only met , but exceeded out expectations when it comes to what a good dungeon crawl should be . It 's better than the first edition for a variety of reasons.First , it 's much more accessible . FFG did a good job of reducing the amount of overall rules and significantly shortened the play time . Going through a quest now only takes a couple of hours , whereas with the original Descent it could easily be double that , depending on how the Overlord played . I can see the second edition being much easier to pick up and play , even if you never played the first edition . Revising the line of sight/monster spawning rules was a very good decision on the part of FFG too , and is one of the big reasons the game does n't take nearly as long to play.Second , it 's a lot more story-driven . In first edition , the victory conditions were usually tied in with destroying some big , bad monster . In second edition , different quests have a large variety of different victory conditions , and it really makes it a lot more fun to play overall . Heroes actually have to think about how to win rather than just mindlessly hacking at monsters , which is nice . The new hero attributes system makes the game much more role-playing-ish , which is cool too . I very much enjoy the new terrain tiles , as well.Third , having the heroes divided into classes is a nice touch . I 'm happy that they actually included a healer class in this edition , something that I always felt the first edition was lacking . The only class changes I 'm not thrilled with are those of the tank class ; for one-shot encounters the tank is almost as easy to kill as the mage . If you play the extended/epic variant with more gear , that problem does alleviate itself , but I still feel like FFG could have done a better job with tank class design . Allowing any hero to equip any gear is kind of lame , but the amount of gear that comes up in a campaign is not huge , so I do n't see it as game-breaking by any means . Overall , the classes work well and are tuned well , and the Heroic Feats are a cool mechanic ( though some are noticeably stronger than others ) .Finally ( and most importantly ) , it 's a lot more balanced . First edition was -heavily- weighted towards the Overlord if the Overlord knew what he was doing . My group and I had to institute a huge number of house rules in order to balance the game out . The second edition is much more even overall , and we have not had to institute any house rules for anything other than stylistic reasons to this point.Overall , we are very big fans of second edition , and it 's endlessly customizable , so when we finish the campaign that came with the game I can easily design more . It 's certainly more of a tactical combat/dungeon crawl than a RPG , however , the RPG elements it does have really help the game come together nicely . Being able to buy a conversion kit and use all the monsters/heroes from first edition is a helpful , too , though I can see people enjoying the game even if they never played the first edition at all , using just the included monsters/heroes . I honestly ca n't really see us ever going back to playing straight-up first edition , although I may use some of the stuff from it for future campaigns I design . Kudos to FFG for designing such a great game !	1
Soooo much stuff packed in the box . It takes awhile to figure out a way to fit it all in the box so you can close it again ( but it *CAN* be done ! ) . I use the components to compliment my AD & D 1e games . I have played the game itself , and if you like pure hack and slash , this is the perfect game for you . If you like roleplay , then the components are a ( relatively ) cheap way to boost components for your use .	1
Opinions are mixed on this game . Is it just a dumbed down version of Descent 1 , or is it a streamlined dungeon crawler , excellent in its own right ? I think the right way to review this game is NOT as a successor to Descent 1 , but on its own merits . When looked at this way , the game really begins to shine.First , what stands out in gameplay is the focus on story . As one offsite reviewer has noted , this is n't a find-the-goblin-in-the-dungeon-and-kill-him type of game . While there 's plenty of monster-killing , there is a lot of backstory for every campaign , hero , and monster.Second , the map is beautiful . There are a lot of map pieces that fit together very well both mechanically and visually . There are map layouts in the campaign book , and there 's a lot of variety there . Everything is numbered for easy use.Third , play is really balanced between Overlord and Heroes . It is entirely possible in most games for either side to win . So the Overlord does n't need to hold back . Heroes playing wisely can win -- but they also can be defeated by a skillful Overlord.Fourth , game play is great right out of the box . There are a lot of campaigns to choose from . What 's also nice is they all have a natural stopping point about an hour in , at the end of Act I . There 's plenty of material , too , to create your own campaigns . But the way the game is set up , it 's totally possible to have the same campaign turn out very differently each time . This means that EACH CAMPAIGN has excellent replay value.Highly recommended for the high quality of play , and for its excellent replayability . While not exactly innovative , the game is certain extremely well done -- one of the most perfect dungeon crawls that exists . The quality of construction/printing/textual materials is likewise excellent . A must play.Owners of the original Descent will find theDescent : Journeys in The Dark Second Edition Conversion Kithelpful .

Since we picked up a copy of Descent , the boys ( and dad ) have played almost daily ! There is so much to explore - so many options for great game experiences.And the boys are also excited to create their own quest scenarios .	1
This is a great game lots of fun and pretty quick paced once you get the hang of the fairly simple rules ... the box just does n't seem to have enough in it . Now I play a lot of mini games and I have payed a lot more for games and gotten a lot lower quality . Perhaps a higher price point with more in it might have been better , maybe not , all said I bought three of them and have a happy little squadron for each side which I merrily blast away at my children with > : ) get some you 'll want more but you WILL like it .	1
Wow the models are tremendously detailed and beautiful , the game itself is fun and there is a lot of fun in the box with only the 3 ships included . This would be a 5 star review If there were more ships bundled . Great fun for ages 9 and up .	1
First off I have to say I am a big fan of starwars and when a company trys to make a game off of it I can be a little picky . I must say this a a very well done game . I would recommend getting two core sets simply because of having that many more miniatures to use . The rules are simple and easy to fallow and they do not cause very many disputes . When you get this game you 'll understand why I recommend getting a second core set . It 's just that much fun and the miniature expansions are kinda on the pricier side of things but you still get a lot of different pilots and tokens with them they kinda balance out . If you are a starwars fan ; if you always wanted to fly around in spaceships and having dogfights or if you like playing miniature games then you will fall in love and become addicted to getting as many miniatures as you can and trust me you will need as many miniatures as you can get.Just a small warning these are plastic not warhammer grade plastic but still decent . Be careful when playing with these little ships they are seem easy to break if your not careful . You do n't have to be ginger with them just do n't go throwing them around or keeping them with all the contents of the core set as some miss handling could lead to a broken heart and a very sad day . Nothing a little glue could n't fix but if your not used to gluing one of the laser cannons on the x-wing breaks it can be a headache to fix . But still do able .	1
If you want to get into a table top battle game and do n't want to spend 100 's of dollars give this a go . For what you pay for the core kit you get your moneys worth in these nicely detailed models . This set is kinda vital to the game . It comes with everything you need to play . Measuring tools , dice , and cards . You will NEED to buy one to play unless you friend has extra stuff for you to use.Game play . The challenge of the game is movement of the ships . You are not allow to per-measure your ships flight patch . You choose a maneuver and a dial that is not visible to your opponent . The object is to move your ships so that your opponent is in your fire arch . And hopefully your not in his . Also avoid crashing into your other ships . Does n't sound to hard but once one ships movement is compromised it could effect the rest of your ships movement . Also plenty of face palm moments when you realized you picked a bad maneuver . Damage is done with dice . You may be an amazing pilot but lady luck can be a bitch . I 've lost a match where I had more then two times the shots my opponent did . One bad roll after another can be devastating.League play . Most league games are set at 100 points . You will not hit this with a core set . If you purchased two core sets and additional ship you should be able to reach that . Or 1 core set and two additional ships . A friend and I purchase 1 core set to give it a try . After a few games we were hooked . We bought a second core set and split the models . Him taking the X wings , me taking the tie fighters . He purchased a A wing and I bought a Tie interceptor and had enough points to play in a local game store league . We both won 2 out of 4 matches .	1
This game is amazing ! It takes me back to playing X-Wing and Tie Fighter on DOS as a kid . It 's nice to actually play a tactical game with amazing looking pieces and gripping gameplay that does n't involve a tv or monitor.I 've never played table/live rpg games before . This thing has me hooked . The interaction with a friend is great . I also like the fact that there is no set board . You and the other designate the playing field . This is a very cool feature . I ca n't wait to start playing on starfield mats .	1
I have played this game with my older kids and we love it ! It comes with everything you need for two players to have a lot of fun .	1
Like most others that play the X-Wing Miniatures game this is the second & # 34 ; core & # 34 ; set I have bought . I enjoy the game and plan on buying more expansions .	1
Long ago , I played miniature games like Warhammer , Warhammer 40k and ... well ... those two . Then , I got married , started a career , and had kids . These new developments ate up a lot of my time and I just no longer had hours and hours to clip bitz , glue together and paint the detailed miniatures , but the love for tabletop combat never really left . So , when I found a miniatures game that required no additional time and was Star Wars related ( I am a Star Wars nut ) , I was sold.The game comes with everything you need to get started : - Tokens- Rules- FiguresIt takes a little bit of time to get the mechanics of the game down , but they include some basic rules to get you started . I strongly recommend people new to the game either watch a Youtube video of a game ( I suggest TableTop with Will Wheaton ) just to see the game played once or twice . You could also hit up a local game store and ask for a demo or see if anyone is playing . Once you get started though , the game can become addictive.Now , for those who have never been into miniature gaming before , prepare for expansion shock . Once you buy the core set , you can expand your collection of ships with B-Wings , variations of the TIE Fighter and even the Millennium Falcon , but these expansions come at a price . You will see full used fleets go on ebay for a couple hundred dollars . Also , keep in mind the expansions can sell out quickly which causes people on ebay to freak out and sell at astronomical prices , calling them rare and impossible to find . However , you can hop onto Fantasy Flight Games ' website and see that reprints are on their way , so be patient and buy them when they are $ 15 rather than the prices people try and gouge you at when they become `` hard to find '' . These prices can go up to as high as $ 50 or $ 60 . Do n't be the fool who funds those guys . Wait for the publisher to produce more and buy at a fair price.One other item of note , the miniatures sometimes do n't travel well . If you are going to get into the game and buy a bunch of figures , check out some custom fitted foam from someplace like Battle Foam ( Google it ) . These save you gluing time when a piece inevitably falls off from a fall or from carrying it in a plastic case designed for nails and screws.Pros- Very fun and the customization with expansions is great- Games can be as fast or short as you want them to be- It 's Star Wars ! Cons- Expansions can be hard to find at reasonable prices unless you wait for re-prints- Miniatures can be fragile , buy some glue .	1
I went into this knowing that this would not be a stand-alone game . The set comes with one X-Wing and two Tie Fighter figures . Each figure has a variety of different pilots and upgrades it can have . For the most part , the tie fighters do n't have much to choose from as far as upgrades , whereas the x-wing can be upgraded like crazy.These few ships wo n't keep you entertained for long . I would not get this game unless you intend on getting at least a few expansions for it . Each expansion has one extra ship in it . Plan to spend around $ 85-100 if you 're shopping online . I bought two of these core sets , a tie advanced , and an A-Wing ( a total of 8 ships ) and I 'm just now feeling like we can get some variety in our games.The ships themselves are made of a really brittle plastic . Our tie advance broke just getting it out of the box and we glued it back together . It 's quite apparent that the other ships will break in places if not handled gently.Overall it 's a fun game .	1
I 've generally shied away from miniatures games in the past but as a reasonable human being I love `` Star Wars , '' so I finally broke down and gave this game a shot . WHY DID I WAIT ! ! ! This is an amazing game that really does feel like a tactical dogfight between an X-Wing and Tie-Fighters . The mechanic is wonderful , especially movement . Between the movement dials and the templates ( one of the reasons I took so long picking it up is that I 've always made fun of the guys at the game stores with the tape measures- not necessary here ! ) moving your ships is a simple thing to execute , though an incredible complex maneuver to plan ( in a good way ) because of all the choices you have to make . Do you flip a U-turn , putting stress on your ship and limiting your actions ? Do you bank hard right , in the hopes that you 'll be out of your opponents firing arc ? Or do you simply push forward , trading space for time in the hopes of circling around later for a more favorable attack vector ? Absolutely brilliant ! Once upon a time board games based on movies or TV almost always sucked . Makers slapped a logo on an inferior product , knowing it would sell with the tie-in alone . There are still some cases like that today ( see the atrocious board game , `` World War Z '' ) , but fortunately game designers are really taking their time these days , working not just to invoke the tie-in 's theme , but really trying to present a great mechanic that makes the game fun in its own right . Take away the `` Star Wars '' theme here and you 'd still have a great game . `` Star Trek : Fleet Captains '' is a another great example of a fun tie-in theme married to a great mechaninc , and I hear that Wizkids is now planning `` Star Trek : Attack Wing , '' a miniatures game which will function in much the same way as `` Star Wars : X-Wing Miniatures . '' Looking forward to that as well.Intense , fast-paced , and endlessly FUN , `` Star Wars : X-Wing Miniatures '' is simply a great game . Buy it . Play it . Love it .	1
This game is fun to play . Simple set up lots of variability and the expansions coming out allow for recreations of many of my favorite battles . The detail of the figures is absolutely stunning .	1
Star Wars X-Wing Miniatures Game : 2 Players* , Ages 14+ , Average Play Time = 20+ MinutesFirst , I would like to commend Fantasy Flight Games for making such an excellent video tutorial ( via the official website ) . I showed it to my son Vinnie to give him an idea of what the game was like and he watched it without saying a word , as if he were entranced . Afterwards , he said excitedly , `` Sure , I 'll play that with you ! '' The video does n't cover all of the content found in the manual , but sums up the game nicely . Well done ! While the video does a great job at giving an overview of gameplay , there 's still a bit of a learning curve when it comes to remembering what all of the abilities and actions do . New players may require a few playthrus to get a feel on how some of these abilities and actions work and when to use them . The manual is twenty-eight pages long , though to be fair , there are diagrams to help drive a few mechanics home and not all of it is gameplay related . Luckily , knowing all of the abilities and actions is not required to win ... new players can explore as they go , mastering an ability here or learning about an action there . The kids and I actually did exactly that , and the first game was just as fun and engaging as the next.I also appreciate how the ship classes and their specific characteristics were included in this game . I 've played X-Wing , TIE Fighter , X-Wing vs TIE Fighter , X-Wing Alliance ( all on the PC ) ... needless to say , I became familiar with how a lot of the ships in the Star Wars universe acted in combat . While the X-Wing is bulkier and slower to turn than a TIE Fighter , it has shields . Fans of the ships of the Star Wars universe will appreciate the detail and how they play in this game.If I had one gripe , it would be the cost of the core game and the expansions . As of 9/19/12 , the game was going for about $ 39.99 at Target , though I purchased it off of Amazon for about $ 33 . Each expansion was about $ 15 and I purchased four of them through Amazon as well . As someone who loves larger space battles , I did n't feel that one X-Wing and two TIE Fighter models were enough to warrant a $ 39.99 price tag for the core game . When you add it all up , you can be spending a little under a $ 100 , which is quite the investment . Though , I admit , as a newcomer to the miniatures genre , this could be the standard . I also would have liked a way to store the expansions in the main box , similar to what Summoner Wars did with their insert . As it stands , my four expansions are in four separate baggies ... not a big deal , but the plastic models are a bit fragile . I thought about removing the insert from the main box to fit everything , but the rectangular hole in the box lid would need sealed off in some manner to prevent the pieces from escaping . I would have been happier with a bigger box and thus more room to properly fit everything in one place.Regarding the expansions , they were a lot of fun to play and my favorite thus far has to be the Y-Wing . It sports an ion cannon that can `` disable '' an enemy ship within a certain radius ... that is ... it flies straight ahead without the ability to much else . This can allow other ships approaching it to get some easy shots off while the Y-Wing flies away out of harms way . The TIE Advanced can be just as deadly , seeing as how it can sport shields , concussion missiles , and is a fairly nimble craft . It looks like there are more expansions in the works ( as of 9/19/20 ) that includes the A-Wing , TIE Interceptor , Millennium Falcon , and Slave I ... needless to say I 'm excited . I would n't mind a B-Wing , Z-95 , TIE Defender , TIE Bomber ... the list could go on.Vinnie ( 11 ) and Anthony ( 16 ) both loved the game and the idea behind the miniatures . They were able to customize their forces how they wanted and enjoyed trying out different combinations . The challenge I had in my games with them was how I thought they might maneuver each turn so that I could play a maneuver that would put me into a favorable position once movement was resolved . At one point it turned into a never-ending loop of , `` knowing that he knows that I know that he knows , he might go this way ... however ... '' , but still , it was all in good fun.Regardless of the cost , the Star Wars : X-Wing Miniatures Game and the four expansions I mentioned were fun to play and offers a lot in terms of replayability . The fact that there is no board allows players to use maneuvers to their fullest , opening up quite a bit of different strategies depending on the situation . Overall , I 'm happy with the purchase as I intend to bring it out every chance I get and experiment with different ship /pilot / squad combinations . If you 're a fan of those old school video games that I mentioned earlier or just like a good dogfight , then you should seriously look into this game .	1
I think that the idea of miniature war games is awesome . It 's why I love the heck out of the now-hard-to-find Heroscape . But I do n't have time or tolerance for assembly and painting at this point in my life , so that rules out a lot of the heavy miniatures games like Warhammer , Warmachine , Malifaux , and the like.Enter X-Wing , from Fantasy Flight Games.X-Wing is a miniature combat game that pits the Rebel Alliance against the Empire . You build your squadron up to a certain point value , customizing your ship with various pilots and peripherals that add to the point total . Instead of using a grid or tape measure , your ships move with a small template . Turns happen simultaneously . The gameplay is simple , but once learned there is a lot of depth to the strategy and tactical decision making involved.Most of the damage dealing and defending is done with dice . The randomness associated with dice roles is mitigated through mechanics that allow you to manipulate a die with a focus token or reroll dice with a target lock.The components are excellent , as one would expect from Fantasy Flight Games . I 'm not a huge fan of the tiny cards for ship components , but they 're functional ; bigger ones would have been hard to manage.The sculpts of the ships are awesome . Everything is proportional and careful attention was given to the detail of the ships in terms of dimension and in terms of the paint job . These are models that you would justifiably be able to display on a shelf . The artwork used in the game is wonderful too . It would have been easy for Fantasy Flight to just use screen captures of characters and scenes in the movie , but they did n't - - everything is original and it looks great.The ONLY reason that I have rated this game a & # 34 ; 4 & # 34 ; is the high cost of buying in . The master set only includes three models . To get a full game experience , you 'll want to purchase at MINIMUM the rest of wave one . That gives the Rebels two X-Wings and a Y-Wing , and the Imperials will have three TIEs and a TIE-Advanced . This still may not sound like a lot of models to have on the table , but I assure you , it does make for a very deep game.Unfortunately , assuming you pay MSRP , this is a $ 100 buy-in . I am thrilled with the purchase and love playing it , but I ca n't say that I would have bought it if I had n't been given some gift cards . If you want more , Wave 2 of the models includes the A-Wing and the Millenium Falcon for the Alliance and the TIE Interceptor and Slave I for the Imperials . Wave 3 will reportedly feature the B-Wing , Moldy Crow ( from the Jedi Knight games ) , TIE Bomber , and Lambda-class Shuttle . The game is expanding and that 's great , but at $ 15 per model for the fighters and $ 25-30 for the bigger ships , it is an expensive hobby.If price is no object , GET THIS GAME .	1
Lots of tactical options , plays quickly , very flexible . Unfortunately , to really get into the game , you have to buy at least two core sets , plus the extras like A-Wings/Interceptors , etc . Pretty soon , it 's going to cost you a couple hundred bucks to be able to field a force capable of competing in local tournaments . If I 'm going to put that much money into a game , it should be called Warhammer.Still , it 's a great game and I enjoy the heck out of it .	1
So this a very fun space combat simulator . The game is very easy to play and a lot of fun . The miniatures are fantastic , I highly recommend this for any starwars fan	1
I had been looking at this game for a few months and finally broke down and bought it with a B-wing expansion . I loved this game so much I had ordered another bunch of expansions within three days of my first game and had one of every expansion within a month ( waves 1-3 ) .Now I 'll be the first to admit the core set is n't much fun by itself , however building your squadrons to your tastes is the strongest component of the game . There are literally hundreds of squadron lists on the internet with their own types of play and strategy . Before you get the idea that this is some money grubbing scheme from the manufacturer this is one of the cheapest tabletop game to get into , powerful tournament lists can be had for under a hundred dollars including the core set.This game is rather young and there simply has n't been time for many expansions to come out , only 12 ships are available at the moment with 6 new ones on the horizon . Everything in the game feels very balanced , a lot of thought and testing has gone into every facet of every ship and upgrade and so far there has been no power creep to speak of . Each ship also has a different feel to it and will lend themselves to drastically different strategies and combinations with the upgrades.The physical models and the art on the cards is incredibly detailed and gorgeous to look at . The fiberboard templates and tokens are durable and will last many games even though there are third party acrylic alternatives.Game-play itself boils down to planning movement , moving/actions , and attacking . You basically have to guess the other players movement options and even though the possible movements are limited there is just enough to make it strategic . Attacking is more or less chance although you have the ability to stack the odds in your favor . There are quite a few rules and it takes a game or two to get a good feel of them , I recommend reading the manual completely and playing a game or two then reading the manual again as some are quite subtle and the actual wording is very important . Young children might have some difficulty and the models themselves are fragile so I would n't recommend for anyone below 10 or so.This is not the game for everyone but it should be fairly clear if you would like it or not , the bottom line is if you think you would enjoy this game get it because the makers did a great job making a fun , surprisingly deep , and growing game .	1
Great game and a solid value ! Part of me wants to buy an additional core set for the extra TIE fighters !	1
There have been so many expansions for this game and for good reason . This game is very fun and simple to teach new people . I 've taught many of my family members how to play and they 've all enjoyed it . I still need to purchase a few of the expansions , which would really open the game up a lot , but if you looking for a place to start within this hobby , you ca n't beat this starter set . The mechanics are super fun and streamlined . You make all your actions in secret and it really feels like a space dog fight with all the movement options players have in the game . I hope to pick up more ships in the future and really have some big battles . I highly recommend this game .	1
First , I must say I love playing board games and card games . For a while , I had been waiting for the release of a decent game related with the star wars universe . FFG heard my pledge , and so they created this wonderful two-player combat game . I 'm sure there are many fans that had been waiting for a board or mini game that gave them the opportunity to pilot one of the rebel ships , or control Darth Vader 's infamous TIE advanced , among others . Well , here is that opportunity.I do not pretend to go into much detail about the game itself , I 'm sure there are already several reviews explaining in great depth the main concepts and rules of this game . Its ' overall very simple to play , having only 3 phases which consist of secretly planning how to maneuver your ships , activate such movement and the combat phase.What I really want to address is why this game is so great ? To start , Fantasy Flight games has made an excellent job with the quality of the miniatures . I was a little worried at the beginning , not expecting much of a pre-painted figure nor the quality of their details , but they have made an amazing job ! ! In addition , the game itself is incredibly fun ! Although its 3 simple phases and one would think the game would be dull or repetitive eventually , it 's quite the contrary ! ! It requires some skill to decide movement of the ships and outrun/outcompete your opponent . You also get quite randomness from the different pilot and upgrade cards that you can incorporate into your ships , each pilot having its own skill or useful attributes . The speed of the game , its simplicity , the excitement with the rolling dice for attacking/defending , playing with your favorite ships from the movies just brings all those fond memories and enjoyment all together . You wo n't grow tired of it ! Without doubt , this is one of the coolest games currently out there , excellent casual gaming , great for star wars collectors ; the miniatures wo n't disappoint you . This game is a must for all those star wars fans or gamers looking for a miniature game that does not require extensive rulebooks or hours of setup to play or build your fleets/armies.Is there a downside ? Well , I find none , the only complaint is that for those that care for more competitive gaming , you would need several copies of each of the expansions , and that could lead to a serious pocket hole . But , if you just want to get this game for casual gaming , and try different ships/vessels that you watched in the movies , with one copy of each is enough . Even if you do n't pretend to buy all the expansions , this core set gives you all you need to play . If you want more variability , just get other expansions of the ships you want . Try it ! You wo n't regret it .	1
The Star Wars X-Wing is a greate miniature game from Fantasy Flight Game . This game integrate excellent Star Wars miniatures with a great Flight Path System to deliver an X-Wing experience previously only available within the confines of a computer game.The starter set includes three miniatures star fighters from Star Wars : two TIE fighters and an X-Wing . These miniatures had been made as scale with each other . Their sculpt is superb , althought the x-wing may suffer from misaligned laser cannons . The paint is of good quality , with a dirty wash that enhances the lines of the model.Each model includes a stand and a base for the miniature , double sided ship tokens for the base and a maneuver dial.Beside these miniatures , the starter pack include some good cards:4 rebel ships/pilots : . Luke Skywalker , . Biggs Darklighter , . a Red Squadron Pilot and . a Rookie Pilot9 empire ships/pilots : . Mauler Mithel , . Dark Curse , Night Beast , . 2x Black Squadron Pilots , . 2x Obsidian Squadron Pilot and . 2x Academy Pilot5 upgrade cards : . 1 Torpedo card : Proton Torpedoes . 2 Astromech cards : R2-D2 and R2-F2 . 2 Talent cards : Determination and MarksmanshipIn addition , the starter set includes damage cards , tokens for evade , focus , target , shields , stress , asteroid tokens , maneuver templates , 3 green and 3 red 8-sided dice and a rule book.Playing a quick game is easy and fun . I started with the quick game and , in subsequent games , added some advanced rules like range modifiers and upgrades like R2-D2 for Luke and Marksmanship for Mauler . With advanced rules and upgrade cards , the game time changes from a quick half hour game to 2+ hours . And I have n't added the effect of criticals yet.Everything you need to play a quick and easy game is in the starter kit , but there are expansion packs available that add more ships and card to the game for $ 15 or $ 30 each . The casual player wo n't need these , but If you are a Star Wars fan or hard core gamer , you may want to buy a few.Overall , this is a quick-to-play miniature game that does a great job simulating the starfighters battles in the Star Wars universe .	1
Everyone gets Star Wars . If you are getting this as a gift for the Star Wars fans in your life you are not doing them wrong . This game is a load of fun , even out of the box with only 3 ships . The expansion packs means that the owner can expand the game as they please . There will be MANY expansions for this game so it will have a long life . I expect this will be one of the top games I play in 2013.If you are geting this for yourself consider also getting Plano 5232 - it will hold all the bits and pieces a LOT better than the box the game came in . I have two base games and a dozen expansions in mine and I 'm only using one half of it so far.Enjoy and may the Force be With You or Rule the Galaxy as you desire !	1
I love this game , I saw it on TableTop and the pieces are beautiful ! A great game ! Highly recommended ! : )	1
For anyone who likes board games , miniature games or Sci Fi in general or Star Wars in particular , this is a great , fun , simple game that can be a beer 'n ' pretzels affair or deeply tactical if you want it to beThe core mechanics of the game are simple and easy to to master , but the expansions and your approach can turn it into a complex and challenging tactical game that stacks up with the best of them.I bought several starter sets as the value is excellent - 3 models each time - and a large group game is loads of fun with all sorts of little ships zipping around.While not necessary , to add that extra dimension I recommend hunting down a star field map or getting a Hubble telescope image printed - much more thematic than just a plain table top , but not essential.The presentation and build of the models and included card stock pieces is first rate . If you have multiple sets or to avoid confusion with other players if you plan on going out into the world with your gaming , I recommend running a coloured marker along the edges of you card stock pieces so you can identify them easily . If you are particularly concerned about maintaining their look , you can also spray lacquer them.The packaging protective and re-usable so if you want , there is no need to get a carry case if you do n't have too many models . I splurged and got a carry case with foam cut to suit to cope with the growing collection , but again not essential.The delivery & pricing I received from Amazon was better than just about everywhere else.Grab a couple box sets , and have loads of fun.The B Wing adds some awesome capabilities to the game and really kicks but in play !	1
This will be a great bithday present for my husband who has been wanting to purchase this game . He almost bought it for himself the other day .	1
What a great game . The other night I played with a couple of friends . One of them brought his two young sons , 7 and 10 , and they easily picked up on the rules . We had a great time playing .	1
Here 's a tactical dogfighting game for Star Wars fans . It puts you in deep space , and gives you the opportunity to ... blow each other up . You start out with an X-Wing and two Tie Fighters , move dials , move templates , ship and pilot cards , dice , a weapon range ruler , some obstacle markers , some tokens , and that 's about it.First , one thing that sets this game apart is that there 's no board . You play on whatever tabletop you have available . That can give you a very wide area to play in . It can mean some long-distance chases . It also means that you can introduce your own obstacles , if you want . ( The set includes a number of asteroid obstacles , but it could be fun to add your own objects for planet size interference , etc . ) Game play occurs in 5 phases:1 . Planning . Players dial in a move in the ship 's movement dial and lay it face down by the ship . Every ship has a different movement dial , which gives it different maneuvering characteristics . Each has its own strengths and weaknesses.2 . Activation phase . The ships are moved according to the movement dial following a set order . A template -- basically , a curved or straight rectangle -- is available for each maneuver . This indicates where the ship ends up at the end of its phase . ( This is where pilots try to outwit each other . Guessing and second guessing -- like paper-rock-scissors on steroids. ) 3 . Combat phase . Pilots that have others in their sights may fire on them . There are firing arc markers on the ship bases and a weapon range ruler to determine the possibility and accuracy for a shot . Players firing roll firing dice . Players being shot at role defense dice . This is where ships take damage and blow up.4 . End phase . Players that have n't blown up yet , or otherwise won or lost according to certain conditions , clean up their tokens and prepare for the next round.The game gets pretty intense -- you may actually find yourself leaning into your turns . The aspect of second-guessing your opponent is a real pleasure . Gameplay is simple , but real skill is required to outmaneuver your opponent . Star Wars fans will appreciate the ship characteristics , because they are based on the `` real '' versions.With the various scenarios available , as well as the possibility to play on different surfaces and introduce your own obstacles , there is a high replay value . Replay value increases even more with the non-random expansion packs , which give you extra ships and pilots . ( You can buy Darth Vader in his special Tie Fighter , for example . ) More ship mean more elaborate scenarios.Drawbacks ? The initial price is rather high -- three ships ? How about a few more for the price . Expansions are likewise expensive . These are the only real drawbacks.This game is highly recommended for it 's tight dogfighting gameplay and its possibility for complex scenarios with expansion.Also check out the expansions likeStar Wars X-Wing : Y-Wing Expansion PackandStar Wars X-Wing : TIE Advanced Expansion Packfor creating more complex scenarios . If you want a break from space combat , check outTHE Book of Word Games : Parlett 's Guide to 150 Great and Quick-to-Learn Word Games.Hope this was helpful .	1
Only thing I dislike is being drawn into collecting , it can be costly for sure , but I still love them all and you will too	1
Nice product well packaged and lots of goodies for the game ! ! I will probably end up with 5-6 of these lol and I defy you not to zoom it around the room yelling pew pew pew mmmmmoooowwwm !	1
This is a great expansion . Only works with the core set . Great for adding depth to the gameplay by providing more options for constructing a fleet/squad .	1
Awesome expansion . I enjoy this game quite a lot . I am going to keep purchasing these to get into a very big battle eventually !	1
While normally it would be cheaper to buy the core game in multiples to get several X-wings and Tie Fighters , amazons reduced price made me go for the expansions instead . This comes with pilots and weapons/upgrade cards not in the core game . The detail is outstanding , definitely worth picking up if you are expanding your collection .	1
The X-Wing expansion is a nice addition to a fun game . As noted in my other reviews from this line , you can play a few simple and worthwhile games with the core set , but if you want to get the most variety out of the game you 'll need some expansions . Because the X-Wing also comes in the core set ( which is required to play ) , it is not 100 % necessary to get this expansion set to get the most out of the game . But , there are a few additions , so I 'd say it is probably worth getting one of this expansion set for most people ( if then , if you want more X-Wings or TIE Fighters I 'd just buy extra starter sets to get more bang for your buck ) .That said , the X-Wing expansion adds two unique pilots that are NOT included in the core set . Pilots include Wedge Antillies ( unique ) and Garven Dreis ( unique ) . It also includes two generic pilots that come with the core set.Wedge alone makes this expansion worth getting in my opinion , as he is the highest ranked ( Level 9 ) Rebel pilot in the game , with an awesome offensive special ability , `` When attacking , reduce the defender 's agility value by 1 ( to a minimum of ` 0 ' ) . `` Garven is a level 6 pilot that also has a very nice special ability , `` After spending a focus token , you may place that token on any other friendly ship at Range 1-2 ( instead of discarding it ) . '' Based on the FAQ that was recently released by FFG , it is possible for him to give a focus token to a ship that already has a focus token ( which definitely adds to his value ) .It also includes several upgrade cards ( many , but not all , of which are also available in the starter or other expansions ) . The expansion includes two astromech droids ( R5 Astromech , and R5-K6 ) , Expert Handling , and Photon Torpedoes.The expansion also includes all tokens , dials , etc . that you need to use this ship in a game.As noted in all of my reviews of FFG X-Wing products , all the ships look great . However , the X-Wing seems particular fragile because of its thin guns . I 've played about a dozen games and have n't had any problems with any ship breaking so far . I am not rough with the ships , but I am not overly careful with them either ( except perhaps when storing them ) .	1
This ship is probably one of the most important ships for the rebel side in the game , and almost all competitive rebel squadron lists have at least one , in fact the world champion used two X-wings and two B-wings . It does come in the Core Set bu this expansion has some very nice cards that add to the lethality of the X-wing . Mostly the usefulness is the two named pilots Wedge and Garvin , both are good with Wedge being the more useful of the two . The upgrades are decent with the highlights being the Astromechs.Whether it comes from this expansion , the Core Set , or the Rebel Transport the X-wing is a good ship , but all come with the different pilots that make it a great ship and I recommend picking up this expansion especially if you want to fly rebels .	1
You should pick up at least one of every expansion pack to this game . They add new pilot and upgrade cards that are quite useful , in addition to another ship . The model is perhaps the most detailed pre-painted model at this scale I 've seen , and certainly the best value-for-money in that regard.The core of a Rebel Squadron is the X-Wing . You get the best Rebel pilot in the game in this expansion pack , too.I also suggest you buy TWO of the starter sets , so that you get double dice , spare templates , extra cards , and 6 ships to start out with .	1
This ship does n't revolutionize the game as other ships did , but it does give you an extra model and the cards included have definitely made the difference in more than a few games I 've played .	1
What I did n't realize when I got into the X-Wing Miniatures game is that it was n't like most Fantasy Flight games - this was a collectible miniatures game versus a living card game , or board game . As such , to play in tournaments , you need the extra expansions , and the additional X-Wing is a must for Rebel players . Giving you an extra ship , extra pilots , extra droids , have fun playing as your favorite Rebels like Wedge Antilles.This is the same model as the one that comes in the starter set , but for larger battles , this is needed for the Rebels .	1
A great addition to the base game . Like everything else in this line , all the components are high quality . This is easily one of the better lines of miniatures .	1
For anyone who likes board games , miniature games or Sci Fi in general or Star Wars in particular , this is a great , fun , simple game that can be a beer 'n ' pretzels affair or deeply tactical if you want it to be.The presentation and build of the models and included card stock pieces is first rate . The packaging protective and re-usable and the delivery I received from Amazon was super speedy.Even though it is more economical to get another starter set with 2 TIE fighters and the X-Wing , you need this one . It gives you Wedge Antilles amongst other great add-ons . If you do n't know who this is , just trust me , he 's an essential addition to the Rebel side and lots of fun to use in a game	1
Just what my husband wanted . Great price ! Better than the in store price . And it did n't take long to get here .	1
Hard to find item . at good price . same FFG quality . needed addition to core game . was hoping the item would be slightly differant than the one in the core game .	1
Provides another addition to the X-Wing game for more options with the game . As many know the core set does n't provide much with it for ships and that if you really want to enjoy the game you need to buy the extra ships . WELL WORTH THE PURCHASE !	1
Fantasy Flight Games has a real winner with their X-Wing game . Everything you need is included with each ship model .	1
Love , these collectable , but then if you read my reviews , you would hear it over and over again . You wo n't be sorry if you get these ! !	1
Its a great peice for a great game . They are not THAT fragile . But they are minis so a litle care goes a long way . the details are really good and lots of goodies included for game play ( cards and tokens ) plus they are really fun to fly around the room making dakka dakka noises ! ! !	1
Love star wars ... and love this game . I will keep buying the expansions and more than one of each expansion so as to play this game .	1
Like the X-wing this comes with pilots/upgrade cards not in the core game . Amazons reduced pricing makes it cheaper to buy these rather than core games in multiples . The detail like all figures in this game is outstanding .	1
The TIE Fighter expansion is another nice addition to a fun game . As noted in my other reviews from this line , you can play a few simple and worthwhile games with the core set , but if you want to get the most variety out of the game you 'll need some expansions . Because two TIE Fighters also come in the core set ( which is required to play ) , it is not 100 % necessary to get this expansion set to get the most out of the game . But , there are a few additions , so I 'd say it is probably worth getting one of this expansion set for most people ( then , if you want more X-Wings or TIE Fighters I 'd just buy extra starter sets to get more bang for your buck ) .That said , the TIE Fighter expansion adds three unique pilots that are NOT included in the core set . Pilots include `` Winged Gundark '' ( unique ) , `` Backstabber , '' and `` Howlrunner . '' This expansion also includes three generic pilots that come with the core set . `` Winged Gundark '' is a level 5 pilot with the following special ability , `` When attacking at Range 1 , you may change 1 of your HIT results to a CRITICAL result . `` `` Backstabber '' is a level 6 pilot with what seems to be one of the TIE Fighter Pilot 's best special abilities . It reads , `` When attacking from outside the defender 's firing arc , roll 1 additional attack die . `` `` Howlrunner '' is a level 8 pilot with the following special ability , `` When another friendly ship at Range 1 is attacking with its primary weapon , it may reroll 1 attack die . `` It also includes two upgrade cards ( both of which are also included in or other expansions ) : Swarm Tactics ( definitely worth having several of this one ) , and Determination.The expansion also includes all tokens , dials , etc . that you need to use this ship in a game.As noted in all of my reviews of FFG X-Wing products , all the ships look great , but some of them appear to be fragile . I 've played about a dozen games and have n't had any problems with any ship breaking so far . I am not rough with the ships , but I am not overly careful with them either ( except perhaps when storing them ) .	1
As one of the first miniatures introduced , the Tie Fighter is essential to any X-wingers arsenal . In fact a swarm of these little guys won a large tournament ! I currently have 5 of them and plan on picking up more when they become available again .	1
You should pick up at least one of every expansion pack to this game . They add new pilot and upgrade cards that are quite useful , in addition to another ship . The model is perhaps the most detailed pre-painted model at this scale I 've seen , and certainly the best value-for-money in that regard.The core of a Imperial Squadron is the TIE Fighter . This ship is very cheap ( in points ) letting you swarm them quite nicely.I also suggest you buy TWO of the starter sets , so that you get double dice , spare templates , extra cards , and 6 ships to start out with .	1
The new pilots in this expansion really improve TIE fighters in general . Hard to stick with buying only one though .	1
If your considering getting this item I assume that most of you are playing the game , but perhaps you are just collectors , which , I would understand and the quality of the miniature makes it worth it . In this same aspect , the figure is plastic , so those hoping to get a metal unit must look elsewhere . Nevertheless , do n't be fooled ; the quality and details are great as so it is for the other models available from fantasy flight games.Regarding the game itself , I have only played a couple of times so far and I think its awesome . I am a board game fan overall , and I was waiting for a game to add to my collection related to a star wars theme . Although this is no board game , I place it in that category of entertainment.There are several reasons for which I chose to select this game . The star wars theme was the main one , but in addition , the quality of the figures , the speed/pace of the game , the flexibility of having set up for your armies with different models and pilots/upgrades just make you feel part of the SW universe . This is my first miniature game , I have been wanting to get one but i always hesitated getting into warhammer or others due to the time needed for painting miniatures , reading the rules , the setup of the games ( takes forever ) and the length and high investment to have a decent army . In this game , unfortunately , you still have the downside of having to get several copies of the expansions , etc ( if you want to play with a large army that is to get the most out of it ) which will cost you some money , but considering the costs of other miniature games and the fact that the units are already painted and of excellent design/quality , it is worth it .	1
Heads up to any Imperial Players getting into the X-Wings miniatures game - you are going to need a lot of these . While the starter is a bit of a better deal ( 2 Ties , and the additional X-Wing ) , you will want at least one of these Expansions for the new cards that are included .	1
A great addition to the base game . Like everything else in this line , all the components are high quality . This is easily one of the better lines of miniatures.You need about 8 of these to really show the force a fully operational battlestation can deliver .	1
For anyone who likes board games , miniature games or Sci Fi in general or Star Wars in particular , this is a great , fun , simple game that can be a beer 'n ' pretzels affair or deeply tactical if you want it to be.The presentation and build of the models and included card stock pieces is first rate . The packaging protective and re-usable and the delivery I received from Amazon was super speedy.Even though it is more economical to get another starter set and get 2 TIE fighters as well as another X-Wing , you should get one of these to get the additional Imperial pilots that come with it .	1
Provided a well designed and very useful expansion to our X-Wing games with some really nice upgrades ! Another great product from Fantasy Flight !	1
Fantasy Flight Games has a real hit on their hands with the X-Wing Miniatures game and the ships are probably why . These little models are just beautiful and everything you need to run them in the game is included with them.Be careful not to throw away the backing though , as one of the backing sheets has the movement template printed on it .	1
Hard to kill unit at least the times I have played with it so far . however lacks fire power but is more of a survive ability unit that toys with the empire . I have n't played much with it so maybe I do not know all the ends and outs of this one yet .	1
I ran into this game while Christmas shopping , and love it . I was pleased to find all of the currently released expansions here on Amazon at reduced prices . This expansion comes with the ship , stand , several pilot , weapons cards , tokens and dial . Allows for more authentic battles . The detail and painting of this small piece is amazing and its great seeing it on the board with all the other ships . Only down side being I did n't get more	1
This is another very nice addition to a fun game . As noted in my other reviews for this line , you can play a few simple and worthwhile games with the core set , but if you want to get the most variety out of the game you 'll need a few expansions ( maybe more if you really like the game ) . I highly recommend this Y-Wing expansion for reasons outlined below.The Y-Wing expansion adds a ship and four pilots that are NOT included in the core set . Pilots include `` Dutch '' Vander ( unique ) , Horton Salm ( unique ) , Gold Squadron Pilot ( generic ) , Gray Squadron Pilot ( generic ) . `` Dutch '' Vander is a level 6 pilot with a very nice special ability , `` After acquiring a target lock , choose another friendly ship at Range 1-2 . The choose ship may immediately acquire a target lock . `` Horton Salm is a a level 8 pilot with one a particularly great offensive ability , `` When attacking at Range 2-3 , you may reroll any of your blank results . `` It also includes several upgrade cards ( most of which are unique to this expansion ) , including two astromech droids ( R5 Astromech , and R5-D8 ) , plus Proton Torpedoes and Ion Cannon Turret.The Ion Cannon is a fun upgrade and the main reason to add a Y-Wing to your squad , but unfortunately the Y-Wing is n't really worth taking unless you also pay extra points for this upgrade ( often usually worth it , though , especially since this adds a lot of variety to the game ) .The expansion also includes all tokens , dials , etc . that you need to use this ship in a game.All the ships look amazing , and while some are more fragile than others none of mine have broken after a dozen or so games . I am not rough with the ships , but I am not overly careful with them either ( except perhaps when storing them ) .	1
The X-Wing Miniatures Games has stormed the tabletop gaming world and for good reason , it 's a great game.The Y-Wing Expansion pack is n't my favorite , in fact few people fly them competitively . It 's not a bad ship , it just has n't seen the upgrade love that some of the other ships have enjoyed . None of the named pilots can equip Elite Pilot Talent upgrades without the use of an Astromech upgrade from the Rebel Transport Expansion . It is certainly not without it 's uses , as an ion turret platform it excels , and it can be used as a hardy torpedo platform because it can carry two ( Although the B-wing and Tie Bomber can as well ) .The named pilot abilities are decent , and the Astromech upgrades are useful but usually there are better options.I feel like this ship is for advanced players , it needs to be flown well and the upgrades matter quite a bit . At the moment this ship is decent but not great but with future releases it might become more viable for competitive play .	1
You should pick up at least one of every expansion pack to this game . They add new pilot and upgrade cards that are quite useful , in addition to another ship . The model is perhaps the most detailed pre-painted model at this scale I 've seen , and certainly the best value-for-money in that regard.Every Rebel Squadron should have a Y-Wing , they are great support craft . I won a pre-release Millennium Falcon with 2 X-Wings and a Y-Wing.I also suggest you buy TWO of the starter sets , so that you get double dice , spare templates , extra cards , and 6 ships to start out with .	1
Great product , great game , and great ship ! This ship adds a lot of nuance and fun to the game that you ca n't get with the base set .	1
Very well done . Beautiful small sculpture that is cast in a resin-like plastic , so that the details are sharp and not prone to warping . The paint job is very well detailed for a pre-paint . It 's rare to find this kind of quality in game pieces.As will all X-Wing Miniatures , it comes with a handful of pilots and such.For the price you ca n't go wrong , whether you want it to sit on your shelf or join your game armada .	1
Y-Wings have always been my favorite Rebel ship . In terms of game play , these are slow , but offensive support ships , capable of locking down enemy fighters and surviving some hits . Definitely for more advanced players , and expect this ship to be the first target , but worth picking up for some variety .	1
The Y-Wing Expansion Pack is an expansion for the X-Wing Miniature Game , which happens to include a great model . The sculpt and paint of this miniature are really good . This is one that I wanted to buy just to collect , and thanks to Amazon , I was finally able to do it.This miniature is about 2 & # 34 ; long x 1.25 & # 34 ; wide . Of course , it is at scale with other miniatures in the X-Wing Miniature Game such as the X-Wing and Tie Fighters.In addition to the Y-Wing , this expansion includes a stand and a base for the miniature , two ship tokens for the base , one maneuver dial and a rulesheet . And plenty of other tokens as those included for the X-Wing Miniature Game.However , the cards included in the expansion take the spotlight after the miniature . This expansion includes:4 ships/pilots : Horton Alm ( 8 ) , & # 34 ; Dutch & # 34 ; Vander ( 6 ) , Gray Squadron Pilot ( 4 ) and a Gold Squadron Pilot ( 2 ) ; 2 astromech cards : 1 R2 astromech and 1 R5-D8 ; 2 missile cards : 2 Proton Torpedoes ; 1 turret card : Ion Cannon Turret1 reference card : Ion Token.Y-Wing has lower attack and agility than an X-Wing , by one in both accounts . It maneuvers like an X-Wing , but takes stress on hard turns at speed 3 and straight at speed 4. and turns at speed 1 are white maneuvers , instead . However , this space tank has superior hulls ( 5 ) and better shields ( 3 ) than the X-Wing.Overall , this is good model for Star Wars collectors , but a fighter hard to master for X-Wing players .	1
A great addition to the base game . Like everything else in this line , all the components are high quality . This is easily one of the better lines of miniatures.This fighter has the ability to paralyze other ships . For that it is useful . However its a bit slow and hard to manuever and is n't going to be anything other than support . Plan accordingly !	1
For anyone who likes board games , miniature games or Sci Fi in general or Star Wars in particular , this is a great , fun , simple game that can be a beer 'n ' pretzels affair or deeply tactical if you want it to be.The presentation and build of the models and included card stock pieces is first rate . The packaging protective and re-usable and the delivery I received from Amazon was super speedy.The Y Wing adds turrets and some great other abilities to the game . A little more complex to play , but the models look great and they are loads of fun to use in-game	1
Great addition to the X-Wing game . Well designed with lots of upgrades that are very useful . Would recommend this addition as the core set does not give you many ships with it .	1
Ordered a bunch of theses ships and they are awesome . Everything you could have wanted in a Star Wars game .	1
I love collecting these items , they are so real looking . I 'm a die hard & # 34 ; starwars fan & # 34 ; for sure . You will enjoy this..	1
This is a great piece for a great game . The pieces arent THAT fragile but they are minis . The detail is superb and I defy you not to fly it round the room yelling pew pew pew whaaaaooooommmm ! ! !	1
This is a great expansion . Only works with the core set . Great for adding depth to the gameplay by providing more options for constructing a fleet/squad . Used characters from the films as well as supplemental materials such as novels and comics .	1
Have n't played much with this one however another x-wing piece to add to my collection to play the game is fine with me !	1
Fantasy Flight Games has really pulled out all the stops for its & # 34 ; Star Wars : X-Wing Miniatures Game , & # 34 ; and the & # 34 ; TIE Advanced & # 34 ; is no exception . It 's a great looking , pre-painted model that really does justice to the film 's iconic fighter . What makes this expansion a must have , of course , is the inclusion of Darth Vader as one of the ship cards . Vader has some cool abilities , and the ship 's secondary cards also add to the fun of the game . Seriously , though , if you are a & # 34 ; Star Wars & # 34 ; fan you need this ship , if for nothing else you need to have those epic duels between Darth Vader and Luke Skywalker 's X-Wing . I recently played a game of several ships that came down to such a duel- Vader and Skywalker were the last two standing . Vader destroyed Luke 's X-Wing- it was a dark , dark day for the Rebel Alliance ! This expansion allows you to create stories like that , and you will have loads of fun . Really , check out the & # 34 ; TIE Advanced & # 34 ; expansion for your & # 34 ; Star Wars : X-Wing Miniatures Game. & # 34 ;	1
I love the detail of these figures . Like all the other expansions come with necessary stand pilot cards and upgrade cards . Ca n't wait for the millennium falcon to complete death star trench run recreations .	1
This is a very nice addition to a fun game . You can play a few simple and worthwhile games with the core set , but if you want to get the most variety out of the game you 'll need at least a few expansions ( though many fans of the game like myself actually buy quite multiple copies of the starter set and most expansions ) . I highly recommend this TIE Advanced X1 expansion for reasons outlined below.The TIE Advanced X1 adds a ship and four pilots that are NOT included in the core set . Pilots include Darth Vader ( unique ) , Maarek Stele ( unique ) , Tempest Squadron Pilot ( generic ) , and Storm Squadron Pilot ( generic ) .Darth Vader is the highest skill pilot for the Imperials ( level 9 ) . His special ability reads , `` During your `` Perform Action '' step , you may perform 2 actions . `` Maarek Stele is a level 7 pilot , who also has a special ability that reads , `` When your attack deals a face up Damage card to the defender , instead draw 3 Damage cards , choose 1 to deal , and discard the others . `` Another nice thing about the TIE Advanced X1 is that it has 2 shields in addition to the typical three hull ( making it harder to kill than a TIE Fighter ) .It also includes several upgrade cards . Most ( but not all ) of these upgrade cards are unique to this expansion , but a few of them can be found in the core set or other expansions . Upgrade cards include Expert Handling , Marksmanship , Squad Leader , Swarm Tactic , Cluster Missiles , and Concussion Missiles.The expansion also includes all tokens , dials , etc . that you need to use this ship in a game.All the ships look great . Some ( like the X-Wing ) are more fragile than others . I 've played about a dozen games and have n't had any problems with any ship breaking so far . The TIE Advanced X1 seems a bit more durable than the rest given it 's design . I am not rough with the ships , but I am not overly careful with them either ( except perhaps when storing them ) .	1
I absolutely live the X-wing Miniatures Game and it is quickly becoming one of the most popular tabletop games on the market.The Tie Advanced Expansion is underwhelming , usually accused of being over priced in points . With Darth Vader at the helm it can do two actions per turn , with an engine upgrade this becomes a very quick and agile ship but with such a low attack value it must be flown perfectly and it takes a long time to whittle down the opponent 's health ( this is a big problem in competitive play when matched are under a time limit ) . The other named pilot lets you choose critical damage card when dealt to the opponent , this can be useful but more often than not does n't do anything although it might be very good against the new huge ships coming out where critical damage is much more likely . As for the upgrades it does have a few Elite Pilot Talents that are nice but I have n't found myself using them much and both missile card it comes with can be found in other expansions.This ship is in need of much love from Fantasy Flight , they might release another expansion pack that helps fix it but until then I feel it just is n't worth it unless you need Swam Tactics or Squad Leader .	1
You should pick up at least one of every expansion pack to this game . They add new pilot and upgrade cards that are quite useful , in addition to another ship . The model is perhaps the most detailed pre-painted model at this scale I 've seen , and certainly the best value-for-money in that regard.This is the TIE Advanced , yes , but you get Darth Vader as a pilot , and he is worth every point . The best performing Imperial lists at the Kessel Run tournament all had Vader , and the winner of the pre-release Slave I at our store had Vader ( TIE Advanced ) + 5 TIE Fighters.I also suggest you buy TWO of the starter sets , so that you get double dice , spare templates , extra cards , and 6 ships to start out with .	1
The upgrade cards in this expansion pack are well worth it . Vader is an excellent addition as well . Also , it 's nice to have an empire ship that has shields !	1
So far there are 4 expansions for the X-Wing Miniatures game . I like that they simultaneously release a Rebel and Imperial expansion , so with the Tie Advanced came the Y-Wing . Both are very powerful ships , but I feel the TIE Advanced really changes the game for the Imperial Player . Vader + Cluster Missiles + Swarm Tactics means you are removing at least one enemy ship from the map in a combat . The fact that Vader can spam Swarm Tactics makes this whole expansion essential for Imperial players .	1
The TIE Advance Expansion Pack is an expansion for the X-Wing Miniature Game , which happens to include great model . The sculpt and paint of this miniature are impressive . If you want Darth Vader , you want this one.This miniature is about 1.25 '' long x 1.125 '' wide . Also , it is at scale with other miniatures in the X-Wing Miniature Game such as the X-Wing and Tie Fighters.In addition to the Tie Advance , this expansion includes a stand and a base for the miniature , two ship tokens for the base , one maneuver dial and a rulesheet . Of course there are plenty of other tokens as those included for the X-Wing Miniature Game.However , the cards included in the expansion take the spotlight after the miniature . This expansion includes:4 ships/pilots : Darth Vader , Maarek Stele , Storm Squadron Pilot and a Tempest Squadron Pilot ; 3 elite talent cards : 1 Squad Leader , 1 Swarm Tactics and 1 Expert Handling ; 2 missile cards : 1 Concussion Missiles and 1 Cluster Missiles ; TIE Advance is a match to the X-Wing in attack , agility , hulls and shields . It can go straight at speed 5 , but not at speed 1 . In addition , it has the Barrel Roll and Evade actions.Overall , this is great model for Star Wars fans .	1
For anyone who likes board games , miniature games or Sci Fi in general or Star Wars in particular , this is a great , fun , simple game that can be a beer 'n ' pretzels affair or deeply tactical if you want it to be.The presentation and build of the models and included card stock pieces is first rate . The packaging protective and re-usable and the delivery I received from Amazon was super speedy.It 's Darth 's ship . You got ta have Darth Vader in the collection , or it would n't be Star Wars . The abilities the pack adds are also great .	1
Vader 's TIE Advanced has long been one of my favorite Star Wars vehicles , and I was very excited to add this piece to my X-Wing Miniatures game . I do love how all of the pieces in the game come ready-to-play ( unlike many miniatures games where you face the daunting task of painting the pieces before you can really enjoy them ) and the detail they manage to fit onto this tiny ship is amazing.However , adding this or any of the other expansions to your game does present an ever-growing storage problem . The main game has the box-designed-by-an-idiot problem with the big hole to show off the ships at the store that allows the cardboard tokens to fall out once you open the game . Adding expansions to it , though , is worse - there is no where at all in the original box to store these pieces , and all are fragile enough ( as they have to be to be this small ) that I would n't want to keep them out loose . Of course , they ship in those blister packs that you ca n't help but destroy as you try to open them , so those are useless for storage as well . I do n't want to be $ 15 for a miniature that 's going to break quickly , but I do n't know yet how I 'm going to store this and the other components to the game to keep them safe , either .	1
Same great quality painted models from FFG . I felt I needed more that one so I could run a team for my game play .	1
Great addition to the X-Wing game well designed as all the ships are . Provided a lot of upgrades and is useful as the core set does not provide many ships with it .	1
X-Wing just so happens to be one of the best games that I have gotten into , and these ships are why . Each one is a really nice reproduction of the vehicle it is modelled from . The package included everything you need to play the ship in the game .	1
Adds to my already growing collection of starwars items . Each one has been carefully constructed to look just like you remember it in the movies . You wo n't be sorry	1
I have heard of the concept of a Living Card Game ( from here on called an LCG ) , but i was always kind of deterred for one reason or another . I did not like the theme , the game had been out for too long , and in order to get into it I would have to spend too much etc ... , But then this game came out . I am a huge Star Wars fan and was immediately interested in this . So I went online did some research on the game and found out that it plays similar to another card game called Legend of the Five Rings ( L5R ) . I loved that game , but again could not really afford to keep dropping money into a CCG . SO i picked this game up , and loved it games are not too long the rules are not over complicated . The first few games will take a little bit longer , but that is just because you are still learning . There are a few minor drawbacks though . When playing as the Darkside your ultimate goal is to get your Death Star ( dial which goes up by either one or two each round ) to 12 to win . This does put a timer on the game , but that is not that big a deal . The other issue is that the Smugglers and Spies and Scum and Villainy factions are almost non existant in the starter game , but that issue was resolved by the Edge of Darkness expansion . Even with these minor issues the game is not bad and for me personally scratched an itch that has been needed for quite some time , and with the newest force packs they are including characters from the extended universe .	1
I bought this card game recently and just had a chance to play it with a friend . Be prepared to struggle through the rules a little bit the first couple of games.However , I must say that the game is a lot of fun to play . It has plenty of strategy to it once you understand the mechanics . Trying to bate the opposing player into playing the wrong thing is highly rewarding.For those that do n't know the Light Side and Dark Side experience is different . Light side players win the game by attacking and destroying dark side objectives . However , they are in a race against time ! The Dark side wins the game primarily with the Death Star dial reaching 12 . It brings a really fun and exciting element to the game . I highly recommend this for Star Wars fans and fans of card games in general .	1
Star Wars : The Card Game - 2 Players , Ages 10+ , Average Play Time = 30-60 MinutesI wo n't lie ... I had to read the instruction manual a few times to get a grasp on what was going on . The hardest part was understanding how all of the cards were organized , though once I saw how the objective and five accompanying cards tied together , it became a bit more clear . Each card has a deck identifier number on it , as well as an X of 6 identifier , which allowed me to clearly see which cards belonged to what deck when organizing them . These little details went a long way in helping to keep the learning curve manageable.Having played and reviewed the two Star Trek Deck Building games by Bandai , I was surprised that the card art was hand drawn as opposed to being actual movie stills . I have to say though that the card art is exceptional and full of theme . The hand drawn art almost looks like the real thing ... a tribute to the artists who helped to make this game possible.I thought it was pretty gutsy for the designers of the game to include two different objectives for either side . The Dark Side has the luxury of being able to wait things out , for their Death Star tracker will advance on their turn no matter what . If they happen to gain the Dark Side advantage via the Balance of the Force , all the better . The Light Side is practically forced to go on the offense and destroy those objectives before the Death Star tracker reaches its end . The good news is that both sides play fairly different , giving players a unique experience depending on the side they choose.Just to name a few examples , Vinnie ( 12 ) took control of the Imperial Fleet while I took ownership of the Rebel Alliance for our first game . I had a lot of objective and command cards that did extra damage to enemy objectives . I found myself able to swoop in and do a lot of damage , though I had to remember to pay attention to each card 's special ability to implement them . Vinnie , on the other hand , had more resources at his disposal and brought in the Devastator ( a powerful capital ship ) and a TIE Bomber . He wiped out one objective with a superlaser card and two more with his ships on following turns . Even though I had Force control throughout the majority of the game , he brought his Death Star tracker from zero to nine in no time flat . If it was n't for special abilities and Force priority , I would have lost.Overall , the experience was a positive one . Our first few games took much longer than the average play time called for , mainly because we were still trying to get used to how the cards interacted with one another . To that end , you 'll definitely want to allot yourself some extra time during your first few games . It becomes much easier to play the more times you cycle through the cards you 're used to seeing . Battles also take a little time to get used to , though I must commend Fantasy Flight for publishing a twenty minute video tutorial , which I linked below . I highly recommend watching it before attempting to decipher the manual . `` Star Wars : The Card Game '' takes a little effort to understand , but is well worth the trouble . I really enjoyed seeing the iconic characters duking it out , though I did find it odd that ships and characters were treated on an equal level . This simplifies things a bit by eliminating the complexities of space and ground combat , so I found that I did n't mind as much . Still , I chuckled a bit when characters like Yoda went up against capital ships like the Devastator ... though knowing Yoda , I would n't count him out of the fight completely . Great production values and a lot of room for expansion will keep this game exciting game after game.Speaking of expansions , there are a number of expansion sets available that provide more decks for players to use . Some even expand the game to three or four players , while others expand on the underrepresented Smugglers and Spies / Scum and Villainy factions . Before spending any cash on them however , I 'd highly recommend giving the base game a go first to see if this is a game that you can get into . It 's safe to say however that Vinnie and I most certainly did .	1
I was not sure if this game would be any good . Well it is fantastic , I have started to play this more than netrunner as it offers at lot more in a two player card game . I feel the thematic is great , I feel immersed in the universe while being able to enjoy the many layers of strategy this game offers . This game will be a long term favorite in my collection for years to come .	1
Prepare yourself for an epic struggle for the fate of the Galaxy . A beautifully thematic card game loaded with gorgeous artwork and pretty solid mechanics . So strap in , and join the old faces of Luke and Leia or Darth and Palpatine to assist in the saving or destruction of the Galaxy ! Five Things I Like1 . The Cards . I know that seems like a blanket statement , but I honestly love everything about the cards . The artwork of the cards is beautiful and scream proudly of the original Trilogy . The info on the cards is presented in a very clear manner , making all info easily accessible and easy to read.2 . Objective Sets . The objective sets are modeled directly after things in the Star Wars universe , and allow you to build interesting decks . Each Objective card has 5 cards that go with it . By choosing 10 objective sets you have a ready to play deck of 10 objective cards and 50 cards that make up a command deck of units and abilities . This mechanic makes the game flexible , yet not too confusing.3 . Edge Battles . I wonderful mechanic to make a mini-game within the game . Players trade blind bids back and forth until both pass . After both have passed both sides flip those cards over . The winner of the Edge Battle initiates combat first and can use the white abilities on their cards . Of course , you have to decide if tossing away a card is worth winning an edge battle for the benefits.4 . Resource System . To field units or play actions you must spend resources by putting a focus token on them . Each of your objectives has a set number of resources that can be used . There are also several cards that expand your playing field , allowing for more resources . It 's a good mechanic to keep players from throwing all of their cards down at once.5 . It 's not a collectible card game , mostly . One thing that always turned me off from Magic : The Gathering was the fact that the person who spent the most money , or had a lucky pack could easily over-power everyone else . Star Wars : The Card Game has fixed cards in the Core set and in their expansions.Three Things I Do n't Like1 . Named characters might be slightly overpowered . I love the fact that the primary characters are strong , but it causes a problem when one side gets several of their leaders out before the other.2 . You can only use two allegiances of each side at the time being . Both the Smugglers and Spies and the Scum and Villainy decks have too few cards to field . I understand that these cards will be released in a later expansion , and that FFG just tossed these in as a teaser . I , personally , hate that . [ UPDATE 27MAY13 : I misread a rule in the rulebook . You can mix allegiances , effectively using the Smugglers and Spies and Scum and Villainy decks . I rescind this negative ! ] 3 . Limited players . You are only playing with 2 people on this one . I know this is something that will be addressed in an expansion , but it would have been better addressed sooner , in my opinion.Things I 'm on the Fence About1 . The winning objectives . I 'm not sure I like the Death Star counter . It really places a premium on the light side not letting it 's objectives get destroyed or letting the balance of the force fall to the dark side.Who would like this game ? I 'd say the enjoyability of this game is n't limited to Living Card players or Star Wars fans . I enjoy both the mechanics and the thematic elements of this game a great deal . It 's also quite easy to learn to play for even the most inexperienced gamers .	1
I 've grown accustomed to any games with licenses attached to them to either be completely lame or a shallower copy of another game with a surface level change of theme . Star Wars : The Card Game , however , bucks that trend in a big way . It 's a deep , but very fun game that FEELS like Star Wars , and that 's a very impressive feat for a card game to pull off . Complexity-wise I 'd put this between the other two FFG I 've played : Android : NetRunner ( more complex ) and Call of Cthulu Card Game ( less complex ) but it 's as fun , if not more so , than those two awesome games but it 's not just a variant or rip-off of those or any other game that I 've played . This is completely its own game , with its own mechanics , and its own feel.Prior to conflict you do what 's called an Edge Battle where you basically discard cards one at a time in hopes of getting more Force icons than your opponent ( the downside is you lose those cards ) , and this fun bit of bluffing and jockeying is for the all-important `` edge '' of going first when combat resolves , then you alternate as either sides characters attack each other and opposing objectives . Between turn actions you resolve a Force Struggle , where both sides compare characters `` committed '' to their struggle to see if anyone gets a force bonus to their cause : Dark Side is basically trying to get to 12 of their Death Star turn marker while Light Side is trying to destroy 3 Dark Side objectives before that happens . These combined with the cards themselves , the Units , locations , events , all add up to a giving a story-like feel to the game that 's just fantastic . If you like Star Wars , this game is for you ... you 'll like it even more . If you 're one of the few that do n't ( why are you reading this ? ) but you enjoy a well-made , really fun card game then this is also for you .	1
Should you bother to play this game ? Short answer , yes . Long answer , most definitely . The Star Wars card game by Fantasy Flight is enjoyable and entertaining . It 's also an LCG so you can customize it too . Now like any games it has some pros and cons . But honestly most of the cons do n't really hold up when you take a long look at them . Let 's go over some : '' The game is n't very thematic . '' I really do n't get when people try to bring this up . The committing to the force rule makes sense in the game world for the Force struggle . Also edge battles add to the flavor . One of the major complaints about the theme revolves around the fact that units can block ships . For example if the Devastator attacks , Luke Skywalker can block it . Now granted that would n't be physically possible . But two reasons why this situation does n't bother me at all . First , just imagine Luke leading a squadron of X-Wings and destroying the Devastator . That works as far as theme goes for me personally . Second , have you ever played the Star Wars CCG by WOTC ? They had space and ground battles . And in my humble opinion it just did n't work . You could easily get blown out if the other player drew ships and you did n't . This works way better in the LCG . `` Deckbuilding is too simplistic . '' Yes and no . I understand why someone could misconstrue this . To build a deck , instead of figuring out every card you do and do not need , and how many to add , you just select ten objectives and put all the included cards with each objective in your command deck . This is simpler on one hand because you can build a deck super easy . 10 picks and you 're done ! But on the other hand it 's really not simple . To build a truly good deck you really need to weigh how important the set really is . Is it worth it to get the chud units just to get the great ones ? How many units are too few ? Too many enhancements ? Lots to think about as far as deckbuilding goes . Different to get used to , but exciting once you get the hang of it ! `` The Game is too Expensive . '' Now while it is true that the game is n't cheap , it is n't even close to one of the most expensive games out there . Granted you will spend 10 to 15 dollars every month for Force Packs . You will need to buy at least one deluxe expansion a year . And if you 're a hardcore player , or want to compete in tournaments , you will need two core sets as well . But think of it this way , you do n't have to add all the packs . Just buy the ones you want . If you 're a casual player you can even stop with just the core set . But let 's say you are a competitive player . Well guess what , it 's still cheaper when you start comparing it to other games ( I 'm looking at you CCGs ! ) like Magic . Magic might release cards every 3 months instead of every month , but the cost to find the four cards you need in random boosters , or dropping $ 50+ on that playset you need is just stinking outrageous ! I speak from personal experience because I used to play at Friday Night Magic regularly . And I am so happy to be able to play a customizable card game without dropping the money it took for Magic ! The game has many pros as well , beautiful art . Exciting and fast paced game play . And try and play it and not hear the movie in your head ! So there you have it . I will acknowledge all games have pros and cons . But you are doing yourself a disservice if you do n't at least try this game out . All the best and may the Force ... .ah you get the idea . Happy gaming ! : )	1
Great art , simple mechanics , and its Star Wars - this IS the card game you 're looking for . ( Here are 3 more words so my review meets guidelines ! ! )	1
I enjoyed the first Fortress America a long way time ago . This is a nice redone edition . However I have played it once and my gaming group has not tried it again yet . I would play again but others are n't as interested .	1
Full disclosure ; I 've only played through the game once as of this review.Fortress America is a wargame set in the not to distant future where the world unites against America due to a new satellite laser system they 've developed . And so America is attacked from East , South and West.Attackers ( Invaders ) have to capture 18 cities to win . America must survive 10 turns . 18 cities in 10 turns might sound like a lot but about 12 of the cities are a move or two from the coast so they fall pretty fast . THe advantage for America is the laser system and the fact that it 's military respawns , along with partisan units . Wolverines ! ! ! ! ( Red Dawn ? Anyone ? My kids did n't get it either ) American reinforcements are card driven and so somewhat random . For instance , I drew a card that would allow me to remove enemy units from agricultural areas very early on so there were no enemies there . Invaders ' armies are finite . If America kills them all that attacker is done . Combat is dice driven . Different units get different dice and different probabilities in success . There is an advantage to the defender in that they fire first and there is an extra hit marker that always counts for the defender.My game group generally consists of me and my 3 boys , aged 11 and 10 ( twins ) . This game is at about the edge of their tolerance as far as depth and complexity . And they are relatively seasoned board gamers . FF Games is right at putting the age at 14 . Although , a 12 to 13 year old could also fully enjoy the game . Be warned , there is a lot of DOWN TIME for the players not taking their turns . Each turn could take approximately 10 - 15 minutes . As such , I rushed my turn ( America ) to keep the younger demographic actively taking turns . Even then they would occasionally wander off between their turns , but would always return when it was time to roll combat.Components are solid , and there are a lot of them ! The board and the chits are thick cardboard and durable . Cards are nice , informative and above average quality . My only issue is that some of the territories are to small for 5+ units . But this was a minor inconvenience at best.In our play it was pretty obvious to me by turn 5 or 6 that the invaders were n't going to be able to win . But me and my kids talked about strategies that might have made their attack more competitive . I 'm sure that the game is a lot more of a turn by turn nail biter when played by older players . That said my boys were not deterred in the least , They 've asked me a lot to play the game again.All in all it 's a good , solid , fun game . I 'm glad I bought it because it 's something that my kids and I can enjoy for a long time .	1
When this game got here we set it up right away and got down to business . It took a bit to get the hang of the game but it is well worth it . We have a blast every time we play it ... .	1
I have previously owned this game when it first game out . Lost track of where it went . I enjoy playing this game and it has updated playing pieces .	1
It 's dice . For Star Wars X-Wing miniatures game . It works fine - just like the ones in the starter set , but this way I can have one per player . Pretty inexpensive on amazon , so it was an easy throw in to a cart filler ...	1
They are dice , just like the ones in the core set . Nice to have but not necessary to play , more like convenient .	1
If you ever play the game you will find several scenarios where extra dice are invaluable . Not much to say otherwise , but I highly recommend picking an extra set of dice up for your personal armada .	1
The dice have no issues and they really are necessary to play X-Wing . This is the best way to go without buying a second core set .	1
same high quailty produce as in core box set . very helpful in game play.allows both players to have a set of dice .	1
While I usually find that FFG games are well-done , they also tend to be overly complicated . The original Android fell prey to this flaw . The world is amazing , and the dystopian cyberpunk aspect is thoroughly fleshed out . Now comes the card game , and the play is fantastic . Again , there 's probably more mechanics than are necessary ( do we truly need 3 separate kinds of damage to inflict on the Runner ? ) , but the LCG aspect is a welcome one . I have thoroughly enjoyed learning this game.Three drawbacks:1 ) The need for too many kinds of tokens . It 's a card game : keep it simple.2 ) The rulebook is n't the best . The quality of printing is excellent , but the rules leave out some important specifics on the mechanics ( exactly what does a tag do ? There are many possibilities , but the rulebook does n't even mention anything other than the Runner can get them ) . I highly recommend watching the intro video on FFG 's web site.3 ) For the price , I had truly expected FFG to provide coated cards . The quality is still above Magic : the Gathering , but if you want to play and deckbuild , you will most certainly need sleeves.Still , if you 've enjoyed the Android setting as much as I have and really want a good game to get you into that flavor , I recommend it . I also recommend it if you 're a cyberpunk fan and a collector - the LCG aspect makes it simple to collect all the cards you want without breaking the bank .	1
and I was n't disappointed with this game . I was hesitant at first because its a LCG and did n't want to spend a ton of money on expansions but found out there is quite a bit of content with this core game . It comes with 4 corporation factions and 3 runner factions so theres a lot of replay avail and both sides are different so my wife and I switch it up to keep it fresh . The theme is awesome and we both enjoy it . I think eventually we 'll get into the expansions but there is plenty here to play for a while .	1
As someone who 's played card games such as the Star Wars CCG and Pokemon ( on the gameboy ) many , many , many moons ago ( and have somehow found my way back into this mess through deciding on going analog and collecting board games instead of video games the past few months ) , this reignites an old flame.There 's a couple things I like about this game that stands out for me.Gameplay wise , the asymmetrical gameplay design is impressive . No player-designed decks that play themselves here . The game involves deck design as well as a steady handed player well versed in the bluff as well as the tell and call . Risk benefit analysis is made in every move . It 's tense.From a fiscal spending standpoint , the game is much cheaper to get into as well with a predetermined set of cards released and no randomization in the setup of this core set as well as future expansions to come . No having to buy rares here to beef up your deck here , its a level playing field.One must be warned that due to the setup of the game , it is complex to learn its rules . The rulebook does do its best to make things straight forward and clear , but a mild to moderate curve is present depending on experience . Videos are available online to aide in its understanding.Highly recommended for those looking for a 2 player complex card game requiring deck building in the metagame or for those that enjoy the essence of hacking or protecting their servers from being hacked . If you 're curious . Give it a shot .	1
One of the more complex card games , but constantly evolving and a lot of fun . Two players only , so find a friend that loves a good puzzle and play away . Look up decklists on line to experiment with the different runners and corporations.One note : You will have to buy all the expansions if you want to keep up , so it might get a little costly .	1
This game is really fun , and not that difficult to learn . Only takes a couple of games to figure it out , and the games are usually less than 30 minutes.The game is 2 player , and it has a defense / offense type strategy with the corporation being the defensive player trying to score agendas , and the hacker being the offense player trying to hack and steal the agendas . There is also an element of deck building.Very fun , would recommend buying some sleeves to protect the cards . Ca n't wait to check out the expansions .	1
The hype about this after GenCon last year was all over the place . I looked into it . It sounded interesting . The more reviews that I read , the more it became clear - I needed to try this . We purchased the core set and got to work learning the game.Android : Netrunner is a Living Card Game by Fantasy Flight set in a dystopian cyberpunk future . A LCG is different from a Collectible Card Game ( think Magic : The Gathering ) because there is no rarity . Everything that releases will give you every card , and will give you enough copies of the card to provide a full compliment for a deck . This was a big plus - I knew it would n't be the money sink that Magic was.The gameplay is deep , but the concept is simple . One player is the corporation , the other is the hacker . The job of the corporation is to introduce and complete various corporate agendas . The job of the runner is to hack in and & # 34 ; steal & # 34 ; these agendas . Each side has tools to make their job easier . The corporation can use various cards like a firewall to protect their servers , and the runner has programs and hardware designed to break through them . The game goes so much deeper than I can describe here . Suffice it to say that this is a very rich game , with many layers of strategy and tactical decision making that will bring hours of enjoyment even when you are n't playing.This is the most fun that I have had with a game since I first discovered Magic , and easily surpasses that level as well . It 's just a deeper game than other similar card games , requiring more than just good deck construction . The depth of strategy is fascinating and enjoyable to discuss.I recommend this to anyone who has ever been curious about CCGs like Magic but balked at the price tag . I also recommend this to recovering Magic junkies . Trust me - this will scratch the itch without putting the same sort of dent in your wallet .	1
I played the original NetRunner CCG back in the day . I did n't play it for super long , but I really enjoyed it while I played it . I was nervous about playing it again because I figured it would n't hold up to modern games , but it turns out it was ahead of its time.For the most part I had forgotten all of the rules from my previous times playing it , but the rules in this edition have been cleaned up , and made more elegant . The manual also includes a fair amount of examples and clarifications.The flavor of this game is done very well , and it fits nicely with the mechanics . As a software developer I can appreciate some of the references that are made in the game.The game , like many CCGs where it originally came from , can sometimes be won or lost by one of the players having a lot of bad draws . The nice part about it losing the CCG format is this happens less . However , it can still occur , but since the game usually runs 30 minutes you 're not out too much , and you can just try again.The best part of the game is the tension . Sometimes , especially if you 're playing the evil corporation , the tension can get so high that you 'll actually feel your heart race as you hope the other player does n't exploit a weakness . This feeling comes from the fact that you will have hidden information from that player , and he must do his best to prepare before venturing into the unknown . I 've found that as the hacker you tend to feel this level of tension less , but you 'll still have a lot of fun .	1
My husband and his friends play this at work and they have man play dates outside of work ... apparently it 's pretty riveting as more and more people at work have been buying it and the expansions so they can take time during break to play . He usually loves board games , but this one seems to have some particular draw because he consistently plays vs with our other games we play here and there .	1
The guys that taught it to us the first time had the rules all wrong , but we thought it was fun so we bought the game ourselves.Turns out the game was 100 % better with the correct rules ! : ) We love the different rules for each player , and how you can customize your deck to keep each other paying attention.My wife plays as the runner and I play as the Corporation . Honestly , I usually loose , but still it 's a lot of fun . The games usually only take about 40 minutes to play so it 's just right for a quick game after putting the kids to bed .	1
If you enjoy two player card games like Magic : The Gathering , Lord of the Rings , etc . then you need this game . If you have played the ones I 've listed then you 've likely already heard about Netrunner . BUY IT.This game is what is known as asymmetrical , meaning that each player has completely different mechanics and card interactions . Unlike games like MtG , where the turn order and card setup is essentially the same between players , this game has two different roles : the hacker and the corporation . The hacker tries to gain access to the corporation 's files in order to expose wrongdoing , while the corporation builds defenses and tries to burn out the hacker and destroy his/her mind.The cards in the set feature great art , are durable , and decks are highly customizable thanks to a few expansions that have been released . So far I have only played with the core set but there is tons of gaming available without expansions . You have choice of three hackers and four corporations so there 's plenty to try out.Again , this game is pretty amazing . There 's a decent learning curve but do n't get discouraged . After the first game it will all make sense . I ca n't recommend this game enough .	1
Reviewed by JD Woody , host of & # 34 ; Live and Let Dice & # 34 ; on adrenalineradio.com.Fantasy Flight Games has a new product line called Living Card Games , or LCGs . The function of an LCG is simple : to provide a solid game with only the contents of the core set cards while at the same time giving the player the option of buying more packs of cards to add to the set . These monthly expansions add versatility to your game and the best part is that you know what you 're getting before you purchase because the same cards are in every pack . Android Netrunner happens to be the most popular and best LCG to date.Netrunner was a collectible card game designed by Richard Garfield ( Magic : the Gathering , King of Tokyo ) for Wizards of the Coast . This game plays very similar with a few significant changes . Fantasy Flight Games took that game and placed it in the universe of its futuristic detective game Android . ( Note : Netrunner and Android are two different products from this one . ) Android Netrunner is a futuristic game with a cyberpunk theme . That being said it is great game for anyone ! It is a two player card game featuring the 'runner , a technologically inclined hacker , against the Corp , a mass media corporation bent on foisting its agendas on the public . The two sides play the game differently . All you have to do is open the plastic bags containing all the cards ( 252 total ) , separate them by factions , shuffle in the neutral cards into the faction you want , place the decks facedown and you 're ready to play . There are three 'runner factions ( Anarch , Criminal , and Shaper ) and four Corp factions ( Haas-Bioroid , Jinteki , NBN , and Weyland Consortium ) .Credits , advancement tokens , tags , etc are included as well as a hefty ( 33 page ) rulebook . Watch Fantasy Flight Games ' excellent tutorial to learn the basics of the game . It is a top notch game and there is a reason why it is so popular . Good luck and have fun with this one . You wo n't regret this purchase .	1
Only 2 player and kind of a steep learning curve . Once you get it and have someone good to play against though it really starts to shine !	1
I really like the theme and abilities in this card game . Both sides play in a completely different way and each comes with its own strategy , which is very fun . This game is already popular so there is n't much else I can say except that if you like 2 player card games where you can customize a deck to your choosing , you will like this game . Great artwork and quality components too .	1
this game is awesome . it is actually quite easy to pick up and start playing out of the box , with a steep learning curve and lots of strategy . very interesting asymmetrical gameplay - one person plays defense , while the other offense . very slick , unbelievably balanced . i 'm still learning , but i find i like it more and more ...	1
I love this game . I 've been playing it whenever possible . The depth this game goes into is very unique , especially given the fact that you have a runner and a corporation , each with different styles of gameplay , different tactics , with only one common goal , getting agenda points . I 'm really looking forward to getting some of the expansions to see hour each faction grows.The only recommendation I 'd have is if you are going to play this with a buddy , each needs to get their own box . If you are going to play both runner and corporation against each other it will save time not needing to break down and rebuild your deck between games .	1
I loved playing Netrunner when it was first released in the '90s and this edition re-captured my love of the game perfectly.It fleshed out the corporations and runners nicely with factions that had some small variants in playstyle ( focusing on different elements of the game ) . It also made for much clearer and simpler rules ( without dumbing it down ) , enough so that my gamer-light wife was able to pick it up and enjoy it on her first try .	1
The learning curve for this one may turn some people off but the payoff is a very deep , well thought out experience . While the theme with a lot of games feels a bit `` thrown in , '' it permeates this one and you really start believing you 're in this futuristic world of hacker vs. corporation . You 're probably going to keep the rulebook nearby for your first bunch of games , and thank goodness for being able to search cards/rules online quickly during a match , but it always feels fun and the more you get used to gameplay the more fun it becomes . While there 's obviously some luck involved because it is a card game , your decisions are what will get you those tasty Agenda cards and ultimately victory . It 's surprising how many actions you can perform on a turn , and while it feels like very few actions are ever wasted , it never feels so tense that it stops being anything short of a great time . I 've never played an asymmetric card game or had an experience like this and I absolutely love it . I look forward to many more games and exploring some of the expansions .	1
Netrunner is a card game for 2 people . It plays in an asymmetrical manner , meaning each person plays a different way with slightly different rules and effects depending on if they are the corporation or the runner.In a nutshell , the corporation builds itself up by placing agendas on the field as servers , and guarding the servers with ice ( defensive firewalls ) until they can score that agenda . Runners build up their power , and make runs ( or attack ) the corporations servers , trying to steal agendas to score . On the surface it seems like a simple concept , but after playing a few games you realize that there is more strategy involved than you initially expected ; I imagine that people who rate this game poorly have n't played enough to realize this , and chalk it up to being a luck based game . While I concede that any card game has a bit of luck involved in what you 're dealt , I compare this to something like Magic The Gathering . Ever wonder why it 's the same group of people who sit at the finals each year ? As with this game , there 's a lot of strategy in being able to play the hand you 're dealt.The game recommends playing your first several games with 2 specific decks . And while I 'm sure that they are balanced to play well together , and cover many situations , I found that overall the corporation did n't feel as powerful as the runner . It always felt like the corporation was on defense , and the runner was in control of the game . Even on games where the corporation won , it was due more to the runner making a mistake , then on any active part of the corporation player . The game is also heavily skewed to having a good opening hand . As the corporation , if you do n't start with any ice , the runner can almost immediately make runs against your hand or your deck . In one game , I had scored more than half the points needed to win by the end of my 3rd turn . Likewise , if the runner does n't draw any programs , they will be unable to break through the simplest of ice programs the corporation has to defend itself . The rules state that each player may take 1 mulligan ( or redraw ) , but then must keep the hand they have , but I 'm not sure that incorporating a house rule similar to other card games ( where you can mulligan any number of times , keeping 1 less card in hand each time you do ) would n't be more fair to balance out potential poor starting hands.During my first few games with my brother-in-law , we had to Google the effects of several cards , as their text was n't clear or easily understood . Add to that the sheer number of keywords and abilities available , and it can make for a very steep learning curve . You *will* be making extensive use of the 36 page rulebook during your first several games.The physical quality of the game pieces is good , but like any card based game ( Dominion , 7 Wonders , etc ) if you play often you will want to invest in some card sleeves to protect the game . Fantasy Flight makes sleeves that fit this perfectly ( Clear Sleeves : Standard Card Game Pack ) , and you will need 6 of the `` grey '' or `` standard '' sleeves to fully sleeve up the starting decks ( 2.5 '' X 3.5 '' ) . And while the base game comes with everything that 2 people need to play ( 3 runner decks , 4 corporation decks , and many neutral cards for both sides ) , Fantasy Flight Games will be releasing monthly update packs that will add to the scope and depth of the game .	1
Honestly one of the best card games I have ever played . This comes from someone who has dabbled in Magic the Gathering since the 90s and has played a dozen different customizable card games over the last two decades . The mechanics are solid and the quality of the cards is exceptional . The only negative I have for the game is that the symbols and layouts of the cards is a bit poor making it difficult to quickly sort out a stack . This is a minor annoyance for an otherwise amazing game ( but still something I hope they fix in the future ) .A lot of people ask me why I think this game is so great and almost always I point to the asymmetrical play between the Corp and Runner players . Both sides work off separate mechanics and there is a constant sense of mystery of what lies ahead as the Corp player plays and discards many of their cards face down . This opens up a lot of player skill in bluffing ( for the Corp ) and deductive reasoning ( for the Runner ) . Most games will come down to mathematical fact in the end but the journey to get there is filled with ups and downs as each card is exposed.I ca n't recommend this game enough to anyone that is serious about their card games . The theme is spot on , the mechanics are solid , and the balance of the core set is solid . Add in a few add on packs and this is really an amazing experience .	1
Fantasy Flight Games have gradually been releasing card games that follow a concept they call Living Card Game ( LCG ) . This is opposed to the more common Collectible Card Game ( CCG ) , of which Magic : The Gathering is the best known example . Android : Netrunner is an example of a LCG . The advantage of LCG 's over CCG 's is that there 's no need to invest a lot of money to get a good deck . The basic set is highly competitive , and there 's no randomization in expansion packs . This review is for the basic Android : Netrunner set.This game is set in a Cyberpunk future . In fact , it 's based on a 1980 's roleplaying gameCyberpunk 2020 : The Roleplaying Game of the Dark Future.One player plays a Corporation , and one player plays a Runner . This is called `` asymmetrical '' play . The objective of the Corp is to complete Agendas . The Runner 's job is to steal them before completion . The Corp wins if all the Agendas are completed or if the Runner loses all his cards -- `` flatlines , '' in game parlance . The Runner wins when he steals all the Agendas , or if the Corp loses all its cards.The Agendas are held on Servers protected by `` Ice '' -- security countermeasures . These can be harmful or lethal to the Runner . Usually , a Runner can only disable one or a few instances of Ice , so he 'll usually take some damage ( lose cards ) during a `` Run . '' If he makes it past the ice alive , he may discover Assets , and he may discover Upgrades which add to his abilities . However , some Assets are actually traps which will cause trouble if accessed.Adding to the game 's variety are Factions -- every player , Runner or Corp , belongs to one . Each faction has certain useful and proprietary cards . These are bought at the beginning with `` Influence '' points . Each costs from 1-6 points . Players start out with 15 Influence points.The game takes time to learn , but it 's a lot less complex than Magic : The Gathering . Because it 's a LCG , the initial expenditure to have a competitive deck is much less . So that makes it more newbie-friendly than Magic . It 's an excellent game , with extensive replayability . The addition of expansion packs will further increase its longevity -- again at a far more reasonable price than for Magic . The game 's graphics are excellent -- neon and noir -- done in exciting comic-book style.Also check out the related gameInfiltration .

You work together to slay the monster at the end . Strategy is a key role in this game . I recommend this game to anyone who loves mystery .	1
My gaming group has been playing the basic Elder Sign game for a while now , and we like how simple the mechanic is , while still being challenging enough to be fun . I 've read some reviews that claim the Unseen Forces expansion makes the game too easy , however , that has not been the case with our group ... especially if you run into Abhoth ! The introduction of the Blessing and Cursing mechanisms are welcome , as is the ability to remove Doom Track counters for completing adventures . To balance this , the game has removed the ability to purchase Elder Signs from the Souvenir Shop , and the Blessing is ridiculously easy to lose ( just fail an adventure , and there go your 8 Trophy points ) .The updated character cards to replace broken/poorly-worded mechanics are a nice inclusion , as are the updated replacement cards for some of the original set 's adventure cards.Overall , I am very happy with this expansion , and with Elder Sign in general as a game . It 's quick , easy to learn , and a good cooperative game ; perfect for a little down-time gaming when other things take too long . Highly recommended .	1
If you loved the base game and are looking to get more of everything ( each card type and component and a bump in difficulty ) then this expansion delivers that . You get more cards of all types and two more dice that add new mechanisms to the game without making it convoluted . The rules are still easy to follow while adding more variety to the game .	1
This adds a whole new element to Elder Sign that helped extend its life span by a great deal . The new yet basic mechanics such as blessings and the enhanced difficulty cards are really quite nice . A must have for Elder Sign players .	1
I love Elder Sign it 's a condensed trip into Lovecraft insanity . Unseen Forces ads a few great twists to it . I love having more big baddies to choose from and more characters to go through . Also the tweeks to the cards are a huge improvement .	1
Who does n't want to play as the Falcon ? This expansion adds a great deal to the gameplay . The mission that comes with this kit is fun , if you enjoy doing the missions . Worth the money .	1
um , how would anyone play a game with Star Wars ships and not want to have the Millenium Falcon as an option ? It can seem OP and cheesy sometimes , but there are ways to counter it .	1
This is one of the first larger ships that Fantasy Flight has introduced to the X-Wing line of miniature ships . This ship is a great gun platform and a damage sink that allows for your X-Wings and other ships to focus their attacks . The ship is far from defenseless as it also packs a punch .	1
I stand by the above headline , but I 'll add just a bit for the sake of appearances . First of all , Fantasy Flight Games ' & # 34 ; Star Wars : X-Wing Miniatures & # 34 ; is a brilliant minis game that weds its fantastic theme to an amazingly fun game mechanic . The Falcon brings a lot to every game . For starters , she 's got a 360 degree firing arc , meaning she can hit anything around it provided its in range . This gives her a major advantage in combat , though makes maneuvering no less important- It 's easy to accidentally fly her off the play area if you 're not careful . The various cards are fun , though I find almost always play with Han Solo , because , hey , he 's Han Solo ( and he 's got a pretty cool ability as well ) . The secondary cards also bring a lot to this game , heightening the fun . Really , if you can only get one expansion to the base game- you should n't ' have gotten the base game to begin with . That said , the Falcon is probably the best of the expansions so far , certainly of the larger expansions . But then , hopefully , you already know this .	1
The detail like slave one is stunning , and with the other expansions and core game the death star trench run can be re-created . Comes in a larger pack than others , with the necessary parts and large ship rules .	1
The Millennium Falcon / YT-1300 is one of four `` Wave 2 '' expansion sets for the X-Wing miniatures game ( and 1 of the first 2 large ships released in the game - the other being the Slave 1 which I review separately ) . The MSRP is $ 30 , but you can usually get it for +/- $ 20 if you shop around or wait for a sale . All things considered I think this ship is a great , must have addition to the game . Here 's why.First , you get 4 new pilots ( including 3 unique pilots with some very nice special abilities ) . Unique pilots include : Han Solo , a level 9 pilot ( the highest level ) whose special ability reads , `` When attacking , you may reroll all of your dice . If you choose to do so , you must reroll as many of your dice as possible . `` Lando Calrissian , a level 7 pilot whose special ability reads , `` After you execute a green maneuver , choose 1 other friendly ship at Range 1 . That ship may perform 1 free action shown in its action bar . `` Chewbacca , a level 5 pilot whose special ability reads , `` When you are dealt a faceup Damage card , immediately flip it facedown ( without resolving its ability ) . `` It also includes a generic `` Outer Rim Smuggler '' pilot with no special ability so you can use more than one of this ship in a game if you 'd like.Second , it also includes MANY upgrade cards ( most of which are exclusive to this expansion set at the time it was released ) : Concussion Missiles , Assault Missiles , Elusiveness , Draw Their Fire , Veteran Instincts ( lets you increase your pilot skill by 2 ) , Luke Skywalker , Nien Nunb , Chewbacca , Weapons Engineer ( lets you maintain two target locks on two different ships ) , 2 Shield Upgrade ( lets you increase your shield value by 1 ) , 2 Engine Upgrade ( lets you add the boost action to your action bar ) , Millennium Falcon ( even though it is called Millennium Falcon on the box , the expansion is really for the generic YT-1300 ... this upgrade card lets you actually call it the unique Slave 1Milinnium Falcon and gives you a nice special ability if you do - i.e. , your action bar gains the evade action ) . It should be noted that some of the upgrades can only be used on this ship , while others can be used on any ship for either side.Finally , it has a 360 firing arch for its primary weapon ( though you have to fire any secondary weapons from the front 90 degree firing arch ) . On the down side , it only has one agility which makes it very easy to hit ( but , it has 5 shields and 8 hull , so it could still last a while ) . Another down side is that the base is so big it 's hard to maneuver ( that is , to avoid asteroids and other ships so you do n't lose your ability to attack or take actions that turn ) .The expansion also includes all tokens , dials , etc . that you need to use this ship in a game ( though a copy of the base set is still needed to play ) .Given all the nice new things it adds to the Rebel side , I think it is definitely a worthwhile addition to the game .	1
I love this model from FFG . Incredible detail , looks like the movie models . This is the 2nd one I bought , mainly for the upgrade cards , but to also run an & # 34 ; extra & # 34 ; in campaign flying sessions .	1
The X-Wing Miniatures Game is one of the best tabletop games to have hit the market in decades . Incredibly well made and painted miniatures and a simple but fun rule set combine to make a great game.The Millennium Falcon or YT-1300 expansion is a absolute powerhouse of a unit . With it 's ability to fire in a 360 degree arc it does n't have to be flown especially well , this is the perfect ship for a beginner player . For a while in the tournament scene it was common to see a squadron build with two of the named pilots from this expansion , which is about all a 100 point squadron will allow for . It does come with the Outer Rim Smuggler with reduced stats and comes in at a cheap 27 points , giving you a nice center ship for more advanced squadrons . The upgrades , specifically the modification cards , give you great options for any squadron even if they do n't feature a YT-1300 in their line up.I think this ship is one of the must buy ships for the game and I always use it for new players to help soften their learning curve . I am happy they have made one of the most iconic ships of the Star Wars universe such an integral part of the game .	1
Star Wars X-Wing Miniatures Game : Millennium Falcon Expansion PackMFG : Fantasy Flight Games # of Players : 2Age Range : 13+Overall Construction : This is a scale model of the Millennium Falcon . The detailing and coloration of the ship are amazing . The radar dish actually moves up and down . Both upper and lower gun turrets are visible and the upper is aimed forward , the lower is aimed behind the ship . This detail may not seem important but since the YT-1300 can fire backward , so it a little detail that is subtle and appreciated.The engine area is n't detailed but considering this ship can act as 4 different versions of itself , it stands to reason that they wo n't all have the same level of engines.Also included are the specialized rules for this ship . They explain things this vehicle can do that are different from other ships . Tell you how you can set-up a playing field using this ship , what components come with it , & gives ; you a special Mission Scenario for you to try to play.You get the base and risers for making it look like your ship is flying . Over time the riser sections will start to loosen up so you may want to glue the 2 sections together . It helps when they do n't seperate when you pick them up.You will have 2 cards made a nice thick sturdy card stock with pilot specific information and dial pieces . There is another card that has tokens for the ship that are specific to the mission provided.There are 4 Poker sized cards with information specific to the 4 pilot types you can play using this ship and 1 quick reference card . There are also 14 half-sized cards that show co-pilots , weapons , and other advantages that the ships can have . All of the cards have amazing artwork that tells you where the money you are paying for this product is going to.Gameplay : Since this is an Expansion piece it can not be used for it 's intended purpose unless you have at least 1 other ship , but the Starter Box Set is recommended . Otherwise , it makes a nice little model and can be used for role-playing space battles if you are playing any of the Star Wars RPGs . But as I said above you can use this piece as 4 different YT-300s if you are playing the game . At Curent it and the Slave-I ( Boba Fett 's ship ) are 2 of the best pieces.Yes/No Recommend : If you play on Star Wars X-Wing this is an essential piece for game play . Like I said above , the fact that this can be used for a number of different purposes makes it something worth buying even if you are n't going to play the game . I do think this could lead to other uses for Fantasy Flight Games . With the 4 different pilots provided it shows that it they were to provide blank stat cards with only the picture of the ship and maybe made them `` dry erase '' style where you could fillin your own stats . Then this would rock.When I was playing this with my niece and she saw all of the different options for pilots she immediately wanted to use princess Leia . I told her Princess Leia does n't pilot a vehicle and that was the reason , but I think she may have flown the Falcon once and there was the speeder bike thing . Which also opens up an oppurtunity for a land based vehicle expansion.Where To Get It : This item , so far , you will only be able to get at your local comic book , hobby shop , or online . Most Comic Book stores are carrying it . I have not seen this game at any of the Big Box Stores . If you need more information about where to get this item or about the Star Wars X-Wing Miniatures Game please see Fantasy Flight 's website at [ ... ]	1
You can pilot a basic smuggler up to the main man himself , Han Solo . With so many options , this ship is one of the best . I have had the chance to play with it many times and it packs a huge whallop ! I recommend to any X-wing player out there !	1
I have yet to play with my sons but as a display piece this is done so well . Even if you just want a nice ship for your display case you ca n't go wrong .	1
What more to say . It 's the Millennium Falcon . Star Wars fans UNITE ! ! ! ! This is a big ship and boy is it fun to play with . If you are thinking about adding to your X-Wings collection , this is a must add .	1
The Millennium Falcon Expansion Pack is an expansion for the X-Wing Miniature Game , which happens to include awesome model of the Millennium Falcon . The sculpt and paint job of the miniature of this iconic ship is just amazing and for many players of the X-Wing Miniature Game , this miniature an expansion hard to pass.At about 5 '' long , you will be hard pressed to find a better model of the Millennium Falcon at such affordable price . On top of that , this miniature is at scale with respect to others such as the X-Wing and Tie Fighters of the starter X-Wing Miniature Game.In addition to the Millennium Falcon , this expansion includes a stand and a base for the miniature , two ship tokens for the base , one maneuver dial and a rulesheet . Of course there are plenty of other tokens as those included for the X-Wing Miniature Game.However , the cards included in the expansion take the spotlight after the miniature . This expansion includes:4 ships/pilots : Han Solo , Lando Calrissian , Chewbacca and an Outer Rim Smuggler ; 4 copilot/gunner cards : Luke Skywalker , Nien Nunb , Chewbacca and a Weapons Engineer ; 3 elite talent cards : 1 Draw Their Fire , 1 Veteran Instincts and 1 Elusiveness ; 2 missile cards : Concussion and Assault Missiles ; 4 modification cards : 2x Shield and 2x Engine Upgrades ; 1 title card : Millennium Falcon and1 reference card.The YT-1300 ( the designation for the standard ship that the Millennium Falcon is based on ) is one point less agile than the X-Wing . In addition , it can not perform hard turns at speed 3 , but instead it can perform a Koiogran turn at speed 3 , and hard turns at speed 1 . However , what it lacks in agility it more than over compensate in hull and shields . An the 360 arc of fire for its primary weapon is not something to laugh at either , specially on the Millennium Falcon.Overall , this is very good model for Star Wars fans , and hard to pass expansion for X-Wing players .	1
FFGs XWing game is one of the best new games of the last year and this addition really pushes the bar . The models details are excellent , all the other components are also top knotch . Up your game and get one of these .	1
For anyone who likes board games , miniature games or Sci Fi in general or Star Wars in particular , this is a great , fun , simple game that can be a beer 'n ' pretzels affair or deeply tactical if you want it to be.The presentation and build of the models and included card stock pieces is first rate . The packaging protective and re-usable and the delivery I received from Amazon was super speedy.What would the game be without Han & Chewie ? The Falcon gives you these two characters as well as Lando and more , some extra abilities and a really nice , to-scale , model that you can also have fun with . `` Pew ! Pew ! '' noises are an optional extra that you will have to supply yourself .	1
Great quality detail and paint job from FFG ! ! ! It 's nice to add a model to a game that does not turn into a big target in the game . the rule for the ship really mesh well with the game play .	1
You know you want this ship . When people think of Star Wars ships only two come readily to mind , the X-Wing and the YT-1300.Get it , fly it , love it .	1
An amazing addition to the Star Wars X-Wing game this well designed piece is on the large side but well worth the money it 's provided some new gameplay to an already interesting game ! Provides some really useful upgrades as well .	1
This is a beast 360 firing arc . Also a good support ship and keep it moving . Upgrade and mod cards are great .	1
this miniature is a beautiful sculpt . it comes with additional cards and pieces that also serve as a nice expansion to the core X-wing set . this ship is bigger than the others and has a rear firing arc , so it really mixes things up .	1
This ship fits right in with the rest of the craft . Comes in a larger pack with all the necessary parts and large ship rules . The detail and paint job are quite good .	1
The Slave 1 / Firespray-31 is one of four `` Wave 2 '' expansion sets for the X-Wing miniatures game ( and 1 of the first 2 large ships released in the game - the other being the Millennium Falcon which I review separately ) . The MSRP is $ 30 , but you can usually get it for +/- $ 20 if you shop around or wait for a sale . All things considered I think this ship is a great , must have addition to the game . Here 's why.First , you get 4 new pilots ( including 3 unique pilots with some very nice special abilities ) . Unique pilots include : Boba Fett ( the baddest bounty hunter in the galaxy ) , a level 8 pilot , whose special ability reads , `` When you make a bank maneuver , you may rotate your dial to the other bank maneuver of the same speed . '' This gives you lots of flexibility to set up or avoid an attack.Kath Scarlet , a level 7 pilot whose special ability reads , `` When attacking , the defender receives 1 stress token if he cancels at least 1 critical hit . `` `` Krassis Trelix '' , a level 5 pilot whose special ability reads , `` When attacking with a secondary weapon , you may reroll 1 attack die '' .It also includes a generic `` Bounty Hunter '' pilot with no special ability so you can use more than one of this ship in a game if you 'd like.Second , it also includes MANY upgrade cards ( most of which are exclusive to this expansion set at the time it was released ) : Homing Missiles , Assault Missiles , Ion Cannon ( with a 90 degree firing arch , which is different from the Y-Wing Ion Cannon Turret which has a 360 firing arch ) , Heavy Laser Cannon , Veteran Instincts ( increases your pilot skill by 2 ) , Expose , Seismic Charges and Proximity Mines ( both are bombs you can release as part of your move and they each work in different ways ) , Gunner , Mercenary Copilot , 2 Stealth Device ( a 3 point upgrade that lets you increase your agility by 1 until you are hit the first time ) , and Slave 1 ( even though it is called Slave 1 on the box , the expansion is really for the generic Firespray-31 ... this upgrade cards lets you actually call it the unique Slave 1 and gives you a minor special ability if you do ) . It should be noted that some of the upgrades can only be used on this ship , while others can be used on any ship for either side.Finally , it has two firing arch ( a 90 degree firing arch in front , and a 90 degree firing arch in back ) . You can fire your primary weapon using either firing arch , but you have to fire secondary weapons from the front firing arch ) . One drawback is that the base is so big it 's hard to maneuver ( that is , to avoid asteroids and other ships so you do n't lose your ability to attack or take actions that turn ) .The expansion also includes all tokens , dials , etc . that you need to use this ship in a game ( though a copy of the base set is still needed to play ) .Given all the nice new things it adds to the Imperial side , I think it is definitely a worthwhile addition to the game .	1
Ok , so it 's a bad Pun , but it 's TRUE . The firespray is amazing . Play as Fett , a Regular Bounty hunter and much more . I have won many a battle with it and so will you .	1
I have yet to play with my sons but as a display piece this is done so well . Even if you just want a nice ship for your diplay case you ca n't go wrong .	1
The Slave I Expansion Pack is an expansion for the X-Wing Miniature Game , which happens to include great model of Boba Fett 's Slave I . The sculpt of this miniature is amazing , and the paint job is just spot on to the Slave I in the Empire Strikes Back . Those fans of the infamous bounty hunter are going to have a treat with this one.This miniature is about 3.25 '' tall , and can only be mounted in flight mode . Also it is at scale with other miniatures in the X-Wing Miniature Game such as the X-Wing and Tie Fighters . At least , I 'm taking the Fantasy Flight Games modelers word on this.In addition to the Slave I , this expansion includes a stand and a base for the miniature , two ship tokens for the base , one maneuver dial and a rulesheet . Of course there are plenty of other tokens as those included for the X-Wing Miniature Game.However , the cards included in the expansion take the spotlight after the miniature . This expansion includes:4 ships/pilots : Boba Fett , Kath Scarlet , Krassis Trelix and one Bounty Hunter ; 4 copilot/gunner cards : 1 Gunner and a Mercenary Copilot2 elite talent cards : 1 Expose and 1 Veteran Instincts ; 2 cannon cards : 1 Ion Cannon and 1 Heavy Laser Cannon ; 2 missile cards : 1 Homing Missiles and 1 Assault Missiles ; 1 Proximity Mines and 1 Seismic Charges cards ; 2 modification cards : 2 Stealth Devices ; 1 title card : Slave I and2 reference cards.The Slave I is a match to the X-Wing in attack and agility . In addition , it can perform a Koiogran turn at speed 3 and has double the hull and shields , plus an additional back firing arc.Overall , this is very good model for Star Wars fans , and hard to pass expansion for X-Wing players .	1
For anyone who likes board games , miniature games or Sci Fi in general or Star Wars in particular , this is a great , fun , simple game that can be a beer 'n ' pretzels affair or deeply tactical if you want it to be.The presentation and build of the models and included card stock pieces is first rate . The packaging protective and re-usable and the delivery I received from Amazon was super speedy.Boba Fett 's Firespray , Slave 1 is a great model and it 's in-game abilities and additional characters make it very competitive and a lot of fun to play	1
The Firespray is everything you want in a large ship . It manuevers as well as an X-Wing , hits as hard , is much tougher , and has a rear fireing arc . Three Bounty Hunters equals 99pts , and is a fantastic entry squadron for tourny play .	1
I really like playing star wars X wing . This is a good support ship . Hit and run keep moving with this ship .	1
If you are looking at this mini right now then I suggest getting 2-4 of them right off the bat . The RZ 1 A-wing is a great fast fighter for any rebel player or if your like me and wish to have all the minis then that is great as well . I was waiting for a week or so for these to come back in stock . DO NOT PAY MORE THEN $ 15 FOR ANY OF THESE . Fantasy flight games has an up coming tab in their website and it will tell you when to expect things to become in stock . Make sure you watch when your buying these because some has the price set as 9.99 or something like that but the shipping is $ 5 and if you order more then 1 the shipping doubles . If you love the game or just a fan or starwars you should get these I plan to get more to have huge point battle.This is a plastic model and is very small so BE VERY CAREFUL when handling any of these . Do not try to bend or anything like that because they will break and you will have to do some gluing . It looks nice not the best job someone could do with them but it is great for playing the game . If you wanted to you could look up some ways to paint them your self if you want to have higher details then what they come with . I would and will be buying more A-wings to add to my fleets .	1
This is a great expansion for the base game . Newer pilots and abilities really add more depth to the gameplay . The A-wing itself looks great . The pilots added are actual pilots from the Star Wars expanded universe ( such as Tycho Celchu from the X-Wing novels ) . A must-have for fans of the miniatures base set .	1
Just another expansion to the X-Wing Miniatures game . Looks good and all parts that came with it look as they will work as intended . I would buy again .	1
Great addition to the core game . I use the expansion packs to make the combat scenario 's more complex and I also use them to increase the number of people playing the game .	1
The A-Wing is one of four `` Wave 2 '' expansion sets for the X-Wing miniatures game . I think there are lots of reasons to add at least 1 ( and probably more ) A-Wings to your Rebel fleet ; here are a few that stood out the most to me.First , you get 4 new pilots ( including 2 unique pilots with some of my favorite special abilities from Wave 2 ) . Unique pilots include : Tycho Celchu , a level 8 pilot whose special ability reads , `` You may perform actions even when you have stress tokens . `` Arvel Crynyd , a level 6 pilot whose special ability reads , `` You may declare an enemy ship inside your firing arc that you are touching the target of your attack . `` Second , it also includes several upgrade cards ( a few of which are exclusive to this expansion set at the time it was released ) : Concussion Missiles , Homing Missiles , Cluster Missiles , Push The Limit , and Deadeye.Finally , the A-Wing also has the new `` Boost '' action , which allows you to move 1 extra straight , bank right , or bank left for your action ( this can come in very handy to help you set up a shot or avoid being targeted by an opponent ) . Plus , the two generic pilots cost 17 points and 19 points , making it possible to have 5 good to very good rebel ships in 100 point squad for the first time ( a Y-Wing without an Ion Cannon Turret does n't count in my humble opinion ) . In short , most of the A-Wing 's pilot abilities , actions , and upgrades are designed to make this a VERY fast and maneuverable ship . On the down side , it only has 2 hull and 2 shield , making it the easiest of the Rebel ships to kill so far.The expansion also includes all tokens , dials , etc . that you need to use this ship in a game ( though a copy of the base set is still needed to play ) .Given all the nice new things it adds to the Rebel side , I think it is definitely worth getting at least 1 ( I bought 3 to give myself some more flexibility , but I can imagine some people wanting as many as 5 to have a 100 point 5 A-Wing squad that is tough to catch ) .	1
The A-Wing Expansion Pack is an expansion for the X-Wing Miniature Game , which happens to include great model . The sculpt and paint of this miniature are really good . Certainly , this is one to consider for the rebels.This miniature is about 1.5 & # 34 ; long x 1 & # 34 ; wide . Also , it is at scale with other miniatures in the X-Wing Miniature Game such as the X-Wing and Tie Fighters.In addition to the A-Wing , this expansion includes a stand and a base for the miniature , two ship tokens for the base , one maneuver dial and a rulesheet . Of course there are plenty of other tokens as those included for the X-Wing Miniature Game.However , the cards included in the expansion take the spotlight after the miniature . This expansion includes:4 ships/pilots : Tycho Celchu , Arvel Crynyd , Green Squadron Pilot and a Prototype Pilot ; 2 elite talent cards : 1 Push the Limit and 1 Deadeye ; 3 missile cards : 1 Concussion Missiles , 1 Homing Missiles and 1 Cluster Missiles ; 1 reference card : Boost.A-Wing is match to the Tie Fighter in attack and agility . It can perform a Koiogran turn at speed 5 instead of speed 4 , and straight at speed 5 and hard turns at speed 2 are green maneuver . It is only two hull , but has two shields . Instead of the Barrel Roll , it has a Boost and Target Lock actions.Overall , this is good model for Star Wars fans , and hard to pass expansion for X-Wing players .	1
I highly recommend picking up a few A-wing 's to add to your Rebel fleet ! As with all other miniatures , the A-wing looks fantastic ! It 's a staple of Star Wars history , running and gunning with the fastest of the Tie Fighters and should be used as such ! This wave 2 expansion contains all required dials , cards , etc , as well as new gaming elements . You 'll get 4 new pilots , including Tycho Celchu and Arvel Crynyd , as well as several upgrade cards , a few of which are specific to this expansion.This expansion is well worth the cost , so get out and fight those Imperials !	1
The A-Wing is n't the most useful or powerful ship in X-Wing . It is very fun to fly . It 's the fastest ship Rebels can get , and with missiles can really surprise an oppenent .	1
Very authentic and packaged well . Would purchase again , nice collectables if this is what you like . Love the miniatures , you will too ...	1
yeah you 'll make that noise too . I love this game and the pieces that come with it . good stuff ! ! !	1
I love the game ( x-wing ) and this mini is almost a must have for imperial players or starwars collectors . If you have played the game then you know the imperial player have it a little easier when it comes to points so I would suggest buying at least 3 to have a small squad . If you wanted to ( and I suggest that you do ) buy more than 3 . When you start buying these minis you ca n't just stop at one . these are great fighters and are very VERY FAST . They can more a 5 straight and it is considered green for them plus they introduce the boost ability . I strongly recommend all of the minis for all players.Being these are made from plastic they feel very easy to break and they are . As with all miniatures be very careful when handling . Sometimes simply knocking them to the floor can cause them to break or snap depending on the floor . Just be mindful when handling these things and I would recommend not letting anyone under 10 playing with them .	1
Interceptors have always been my favorite Imperial craft . This one is a great addition for the base game . These provide a great way to increase your imperial squadron 's strength .	1
Plenty of detail and new pilots and upgrades . Fits right in with the other Tie 's , for plenty of recreations . Comes with all necessary pieces , recommend getting a few of these for squad building of 100 points	1
The TIE Interceptor is one of four `` Wave 2 '' expansion sets for the X-Wing miniatures game . I think there are lots of reasons to add a TIE Interceptor ( or 3 ) to your Imperial fleet ; here are a few that stood out the most to me.First , you get 6 new pilots ( including 3 unique pilots with some very nice special abilities ) . Unique pilots include : Soontir Fel , a level 9 pilot ( the highest level ) whose special ability reads , `` When you receive a stress token , you may assign 1 focus token to your ship . `` Turr Phenir , a level 7 pilot whose special ability reads , `` After you perform an attack , you may perform a free boost or barrel roll action . `` `` Fel 's Wrath '' , a level 5 pilot whose special ability reads , `` When the number of damage cards assigned to you equals or exceeds your hull value , you are not destroyed until the end of the combat phase '' .Second , it also includes two upgrade cards ( one of which is exclusive to this expansion set at the time it was released ) : Daredevil and Elusiveness.Finally , the TIE Interceptor also has the new `` Boost '' action , which allows you to move 1 extra straight , bank right , or bank left for your action ( this can come in very handy to help you set up a shot or avoid being targeted by an opponent ) . Plus , it has 3 attack , which means it is more likely to succeed at a hit than Wave 1 Imperial ships which have only 2 attack.The expansion also includes all tokens , dials , etc . that you need to use this ship in a game ( though a copy of the base set is still needed to play ) .Given all the nice new things it adds to the Imperial side , I think it is definitely a worthwhile addition to the game . I liked it so much that I bought 3 so I can run a 100 point squad that includes 3 TIE Interceptor and 3 TIE Fighters .	1
I love the & # 34 ; squints & # 34 ; in Star Wars . Great model , fun to play in FFG 's X-wing game . Only way to make this better , it would have to be the Imperial Aces pack coming in December .	1
Soontir Fel is reason alone to have a few of these in your fleet . They are fast , agile , hit hard and are hard to hit ! I have several of these and run them constantly in my games .	1
The TIE Interceptor Expansion Pack is an expansion for the X-Wing Miniature Game , which happens to include great model . The sculpt and paint of this miniature are really good . Certainly , this is one to consider for the rebels.This miniature is about 1.5 '' long x 1 '' wide . Also , it is at scale with other miniatures in the X-Wing Miniature Game such as the X-Wing and Tie Fighters.In addition to the TIE Interceptor , this expansion includes a stand and a base for the miniature , two ship tokens for the base , one maneuver dial and a rulesheet . Of course there are plenty of other tokens as those included for the X-Wing Miniature Game.However , the cards included in the expansion take the spotlight after the miniature . This expansion includes:6 ships/pilots : Soontir Fel , Turr Phennir , Fel 's Wrath , Saber Squadron Pilot , Avenger Squadron Pilot and a Alpha Squadron Pilot ; 2 elite talent cards : 1 Elusiveness and 1 Daredevil ; 1 reference card : Boost.TIE Interceptor matches to the Tie Fighter in agility ans hulls . It can perform a Koiogran turn at speed 5 instead of speed 4 , and straight at speed 5 and hard turns at speed 2 are green maneuver . In addition , it has the Boost action.Overall , this is great model for Star Wars fans , and hard to pass expansion for X-Wing players .	1
Purchased a second one before I discovered that an Emperial Aces Expansion Pack was coming out ... I believe I will wait for the Rebel Aces Expansion pack before I purchase any other duplicates models .	1
I would tell any one to purchase these items , makes for a great game and it started a grat collection	1
The gamer this was given to at Christmas really loves this kit . It 's hard to buy for a gamer when you 're not a gamer , but this turned out to be a good choice . I was really pleased that it worked out .	1
The only thing that is n't on the chart is the Range Bands . That would have been great , but EVERYTHING else is there . A must-have for any GM .	1
I do n't know why my expectations were so low on this product . Frankly , I 've been playing RPGs since I was 14 which would be the summer of 1979 . Back then RPGs products were crap . I recently decided it would be fun to play some of these games again so I picked up this because I really liked the theme of it and the videos FFG did really won me over . Overall this screen is well made ( boardgame quality construction for the screen ) and the content of information on it is perfect for anyone not familiar with the conventions of this game which will be about 90 % of their customers since so much of it appears to be new.If you have an android device or iOS get the FFG dice roller as well . Its MUCH cheaper than the physical dice ! Star WarsTM Dice	1
Game Master 's Kit might be a stretch.The produce consists of a game master four board screen and a thirty page , starter adventure.Both are high quality.I was hoping for a resource that would aid in generating adventures , but the four pages of tables are the ones that you will likely use most often as a game master.Also , after playing the Beginner 's Game , I was hoping for some counters , but again , no love.Perhaps future publications will include these things .	1
This ship is awesome ! Some have written about problems with the wings folding down , but I do n't have that issue . I have n't yet used it for gameplay but after looking at some of the cards and missions , I 'm super stoked to use this bad-boy !	1
The Lambda-Class Shuttle ( a.k.a. , Imperial Shuttle ) is one of four `` Wave 3 '' expansion sets for the X-Wing miniatures game . I think there are several good reasons to add a couple of this ship to your Imperil fleet.As with the HWK-290 , it should be kept in mind that the Lambda-Class Shuttle is mostly a support ship ( but , unlike the HWK-290 it is not almost solely a support ship and it definitely has some nice advantages of its own ) . It should also be noted that this is the only ship in Wave 3 that comes on a large base ( which can make it a bit more difficult to maneuver ) .That said , the base stats for this ship range from poor to excellent overall , and include 3 attack dice ( excellent for Imperials ) , 1 defense dice ( the worst yet for an Imperial ship , but the lots of hull and shield will help make up for this ) , 5 hull ( very good or better for Imperials ) , and 5 shields ( excellent for an Imperial ship ) . All Lambda-Class Shuttles also have the focus and target-lock actions ( making this the second Imperial ship without the evade action , and the Imperial ship with the least number of possible actions overall ) . They can also be upgraded in several ways with a variety of previous and new modifications , including a crew upgrade.Second , you get 4 new pilots ( including 3 unique pilots with some very nice special abilities ) . Pilots include : ( 1 ) Omicron Group Pilot , a level 2 non-unique pilot that costs 21 points . ( 2 ) Captain Yorr , a level 4 unique pilot that costs 24 points , who has a support special ability that reads , `` When another friendly ship at Range 1-2 would receive a stress token , if you have 2 or fewer stress tokens , you may receive that token instead . `` ( 3 ) Colonel Jendon , a level 6 unique pilot that costs 26 points , whose support special ability reads , `` At the start of the Combat Phase , you may assign 1 of your blue target lock tokens to a friendly ship at Range 1 if it does not have a blue target lock token . `` ( 4 ) Captain Kagi , a level 8 unique pilot that costs 27 points , whose support special ability reads , `` When an enemy ship acquires a target lock , it must lock onto your ship if able . `` Third , it also includes 12 upgrade cards ( most of which is exclusive to this expansion set at the time it was released ) : ( 1 ) ST-321allows an Imperial Shuttle ( only ) with this modification to acquire a target lock on any eligible ship on the board even if they would normally be considered out of range for a target lock ; ( 2 ) Intelligent Agent -- a 1 point crew upgrade that allows you to look at the movement dial of one enemy ship at range 1-2 at the start of the activation phase ; ( 3 ) Darth Vader -- a very interesting 3 point unique crew upgrade that allows you to take 2 damage to cause a ship you just attacked 1 critical damage ; ( 4 ) Navigator -- a 3 point crew upgrade that lets you change your maneuver dial to another maneuver with the same baring ; ( 5 ) Weapons Engineer -- a 3 point crew upgrade that was also released in wave 2 ; ( 6 ) Rebel Captive -- a nice 3 point crew upgrade that requires the first ship to attack you during round to suffer one stress token ; ( 7 ) Flight Instructor -- a 4 point crew upgrade that lets you reroll one of your focus OR blank results depending on the defenders pilot skill ; ( 8 ) Advanced Sensors -- an interesting 3 point upgrade that lets you do your action before rather than after you move , which will come in very handy if you think you 'll end up colliding with a ship or asteroid ; ( 9 ) Heavy Laser Cannon -- a 7 point secondary weapon upgrade that was also included in Wave 2 ; ( 10 ) Sensor Jammer -- a very interesting 4 point upgrade that allows you to change one of the attackers hit results to a focus ( and also prevents them from rerolling this focus ) ; and ( 11 ) TWO copies of Anti-Pursuit Lasers - an awesome 2 point upgrade that lets you roll one attack dice against enemy ships that end by touching your base.As with all expansions , this one includes all tokens , dials , etc . that you need to use this ship in a game ( though a copy of the base set is still needed to play ) . In fact , another very interesting things about this ship is the maneuver dial ... it is the first and only ( as of the time this review was written ) to include 0 movement ( i.e. , you can take a stress token and not move at all ) . This will come in very handy if you want ships to crash into you so you can get free shots off with Anti-Pursuit Lasers.Given all the nice new things it adds to the Imperial side ( especially the upgrades , many of which can be used with other ships ) , I think it is a very worthwhile addition to the game . I bought 2 for now , but could see owing up to 4 at some point depending on how they play over time . Definitely take a look around online as you can often find these for less than $ 20 each with free shipping if you buy enough .	1
So , the finish on these across the board is not very good at all . When you are using a stark white paint , any imperfections are very noticeable . Also , the wings on mine did not go down as far as they were meant to . Other than that , the gameplay possibilities are amazing . This ship can stand still and become a strategic battle station .	1
The Lambda ShuttleExpansion Pack is an expansion for the X-Wing Miniature Game , which happens to include a great model . The sculpt is great , but the paint job suffered a bit as something is off . I wanted to buy this one just to collect as it takes a better player than me to put it on play.This miniature is to scale to other X-Wing Miniatures such as the Millennium Falcon or Slave I.In addition to the Lambda Shuttle , this expansion includes a stand and a base for the miniature , two ship tokens for the base , one maneuver dial , a rulesheet and plenty of other tokens as those included for the X-Wing Miniature Game.As in other expansions , the cards included take the spotlight after the miniature . This expansion includes:4 ships/pilots : Captain Kagi ( 8 ) , Colonel Jendon ( 6 ) , Captain Yorr ( 4 ) and an Omicron Group Pilot ( 2 ) ; 6 crew cards : Darth Vader , Rebel Captive , Weapon Engineer , Navigator , Flight Instructor and Intelligence Agent ; 2 sensor cards : Advanced Sensors , and Sensor Jammer ; 2 utility cards : 2 Anti-Pursuit Lasers ; 1 cannon card : Heavy Laser Cannon ; 1 title card : ST-321Lambda Shuttle has lower agility than an X-Wing , but as much firepower . Compared to an X-Wing , the Lambda Shuttle has no straight at speed 4 , or hard turns at speed 3 . In addition , it takes stress on turns at speed 3 , and hard turns at speed 2 . It has no koiogran turn , but it can perform a 0 maneuver ( full stop , same facing ) at speed 0 instead . This one is also a red maneuver . However , the Lamda Shuttle superior hulls ( 5 ) and superb shields ( 5 ) are better than the X-Wing.Overall , this is good model for Star Wars collectors , but is a shuttle so its difficult to handle in battle .	1
Fun addition to the imperials . with great upgrade cards . The only thing giving this a 4 instead of 5 is that you really need to press hard to fully extend the wings . Everytime I do so I am worried I will break something . The other thing is that the small mini pin that connects to the larger pins and subsequently the base came out right away . I have never had any problems with these ships until wave 3 now I am having all sorts of pin issues .	1
For anyone who likes board games , miniature games or Sci Fi in general or Star Wars in particular , this is a great , fun , simple game that can be a beer 'n ' pretzels affair or deeply tactical if you want it to be.The presentation and build of the models and included card stock pieces is first rate . The packaging protective and re-usable and the delivery I received from Amazon was super speedy.The Shuttle is not speedy , but again adds some nice abilities and characters and the support role it can add to a fleet is quite a lot of fun	1
Same great quality figures . Weather you are playing a game or just collecting the models . This was a much needed addition the the Empire faction of the game .	1
Star wars X wing is a great game . I 'm still working this ship into my squad . Not sure yet . I need more play time with it .	1
The B-Wing is one of four `` Wave 3 '' expansion sets for the X-Wing miniatures game . I think there are some good reasons to add a few B-Wings to your Rebel fleet ; here are those that really stood out the most to me.First , the base stats for this ship include 3 attack dice , 1 defense dice , 3 hull , and 5 shields ( having more shields than hull means they will be less effected by critical hits overall ) . All B-Wings also have the focus , target-lock , and barrel role actions ( note : this is the first Rebel ships with the barrel role action ) . They can also be upgraded in several ways with a variety of previous and new modifications.Second , you get 4 pilots ( including 2 unique pilots with some very nice special abilities ) . Pilots include : ( 1 ) Blue Squadron Pilot , a level 2 non-unique pilot that cost 22 points . ( 2 ) Dagger Squadron Pilot , a level 4 non-unique pilot that costs 24 points . ( 3 ) Ibtisam , a level 6 unique pilot that costs 28 points , who has a very handy offensive AND defensive special ability that reads , `` When attacking or defending , if you have at least one stress token , you may reroll 1 of your dice . `` ( 4 ) Ten Numb , a level 8 unique pilot that costs 31 points , whose very nice offensive special ability reads , `` When attacking , 1 of your critical hit results can not be cancelled by defense dice . `` Third , it also includes five new upgrade cards ( two of which is exclusive to this expansion set at the time it was released ) : ( 1 ) Proton Torpedoes -- a 4 point upgrade that came with several other Rebel ships ; ( 2 ) Ion Cannon -- a 3 point upgrade also came with the Firespray-31 expansion ; ( 3 ) Autoblaster -- an amazing 5 point upgrade whose hits can not be canceled by defense dice ( this will likely find just as much or more use on the Firespray-31 ) ; ( 4 ) Advanced Proton Torpedoes -- another awesome 6 point upgrade that gives you 5 attack dice and allows you to change up to 3 of your blank results to focus results ( also comes with the TIE Bomber ) ; and ( 5 ) Fire-Control Systems -- a nice 2 point upgrade that allows you to acquire a target lock on a ship AFTER you perform an attack.As with all expansions , this one includes all tokens , dials , etc . that you need to use this ship in a game ( though a copy of the base set is still needed to play ) .Given all the nice new things it adds to the Rebel side , I think it is definitely a worthwhile addition to the game . Not to mention that the ship itself looks pretty cool . I liked it so much that I bought 4 of them ( I probably wo n't use more than 1-2 at a time , but I figure better too many than too few ) .	1
Let 's start out with the positives , great model , nice paint job . This model should pivot or roll like the ship would . They even placed it at an angle in the display packaging , but on the stand it forms a T .	1
The b-wing from Wave 3 is not the best of the ships , but it is still worth having around . It has some great interactions with some of the older weapons and has pretty good shields . I would recommend you pick up a few for your arsenal if you can .	1
The B-Wing , as with the other expansions , is impeccably painted . The included cards deepen gameplay choices and I have already seen a lot of use with this expansion .	1
The B-Wing Expansion Pack is an expansion for the X-Wing Miniature Game , which happens to include a great model . The sculpt and paint of this miniature are really good . I wanted to buy this one just to collect , but I may try it in a friendly match.This miniature is about 2 & # 34 ; tall x 1.25 & # 34 ; wide . Of course , it is at scale with other miniatures in the X-Wing Miniature Game such as the X-Wing and Tie Fighters.In addition to the B-Wing , this expansion includes a stand and a base for the miniature , two ship tokens for the base , one maneuver dial , a rulesheet , and plenty of other tokens as those included for the X-Wing Miniature Game.However , the cards included in the expansion take the spotlight after the miniature . This expansion includes:4 ships/pilots : Ten Numb ( 8 ) , Ibtisam ( 6 ) , Dagger Squadron Pilot ( 4 ) and a Blue Squadron Pilot ( 2 ) ; 2 missile cards : 1 Avance Proton Torpedoes and 1 Proton Torpedoes ; 2 cannon card : Ion Cannon and 1 Autoblaster ; 1 sensor card : Fire-Control System:1 reference card : Ion Token.B-Wing is less agile than the X-Wing , but has the same attack power . It can not perform hard turns at speed 3 , but instead it can perform a Koiogran turn at speed 2 , and hard turns at speed 1 but with stress . It also takes stress on turn at speed 3 and straight at speed 4 . This ship compensate on shields ( 5 ) instead and it also have a barrel roll maneuver.Overall , this is good model for Star Wars collectors , but a tough fighter if you can master it .	1
For anyone who likes board games , miniature games or Sci Fi in general or Star Wars in particular , this is a great , fun , simple game that can be a beer 'n ' pretzels affair or deeply tactical if you want it to be.The presentation and build of the models and included card stock pieces is first rate . The packaging protective and re-usable and the delivery I received from Amazon was super speedy.The B Wing adds some awesome capabilities to the game and really kicks but in play !	1
This was my favorite fighter in the Star Wars universe , but Fantasy Flight 's pilot cards and maneuvers makes this ship not a good dog-fighter . I found the best strategy with the B-Wing is to go very slow and rotate around and shoot ( like a mobile gun platform ) . The mini is great with an amazing paint job and mold . Overall , I am very happy .	1
this is a fun add on to the X-wing core game . I got two and we play with them often .	1
Ahh , the TIE bomber , the infamous hunter of the Millennium Falcon from Empire Strikes Back , and a solid addition to your imperial fleet.First of all , the appearance of the ships are great . As always , Fantasy Flight has put some great detail into their miniatures and made them worthy of the Star Wars brand . But do n't be fooled , these little ships are good for more than just vain appearances , they are beasts in combat.While they only get to roll two attack dice on their primary weapons , the draw for these ships is in the secondary category . Each TIE bomber can roll out on the field with two proton torpedoes and two missiles ... that 's four heavy weapons you can use to smoke the Falcon with ( assuming you can draw it out from inside the belly of the space worm ... ) . But it does not end there , TIE bombers can also carry ... wait for it ... BOMBS . That 's right , like the Firespray , the TIE bomber can take bombs to make it that much more of a pain to deal with.There is one drawback to relying on secondary weapons like missiles : the need for target locks . This problem , however , can be addressed with the addition of a Lambda Class Shuttle , specifically Colonel Jendon , who has a special ability that allows you to transfer a target lock to any other friendly ship . Couple this with the ST-321 title card which allows the shuttle to lock onto ANY target on the board , regardless of if it is withing range , and you create a dangerous combination.Take a Firespray on the field and you paint a giant red target on your ship . Put a TIE bomber , fully loaded in play , and you have a destructive weapon flying under the radar .	1
The TIE Bomber is one of four `` Wave 3 '' expansion sets for the X-Wing miniatures game . I think there are some good reasons to add SEVERAL TIE Bombers to your Imperil fleet.First , the base stats for this ship are very nice overall , and include 2 attack dice ( same as a regular TIE Fighter ) , 2 defense dice ( one less than a regular TIE fighter ) , 6 hull ( twice the number of a regular TIE Fighter ) , and 0 shields ( same as a regular TIE Fighter ) . All TIE Bombers also have the focus , target-lock , and barrel role actions ( making this the first Imperial ship without the evade action , but the extra hull probably make up for this ) . They can also be upgraded in several ways with a variety of previous and new modifications.Second , you get 4 new pilots ( including 2 unique pilots with some very nice special abilities ) . Pilots include : ( 1 ) Scimitar Squadron Pilot , a level 2 non-unique pilot that cost 16 points ( I can imagine using up to five of this pilot with some of the bombs and torpedoes that come with this or other ships - see below ) . ( 2 ) Gamma Squadron Pilot , a level 4 non-unique pilot that costs 18 points . ( 3 ) Captain Jonus , a level 6 unique pilot that costs 22 points , who has a very handy offensive/support special ability that reads , `` When another friendly ship at Range 1 attacks with a secondary weapon , it may reroll up to 2 attack dice . `` ( 4 ) Major Rhymer , a level 7 unique pilot that costs 26 points , whose very nice offensive special ability reads , `` When attacking with a secondary weapon , you may increase or decrease the weapon range by 1 to a limit of Range 1-3 . '' ( Which pretty much means you can almost always attack with your secondary weapon regardless of its base range restrictions . ) Third , it also includes five new upgrade cards ( at least a couple of which is exclusive to this expansion set at the time it was released ) : ( 1 ) Assault Missiles -- a 5 point upgrade that came in at least previous ship ; ( 2 ) Advanced Proton Torpedoes -- an amazing 6 point upgrade that gives you 5 attack dice and allows you to change up to 3 of your blank results to focus results ( also comes with the B-Wing ) ; ( 3 ) Seismic Charge -- a nice 2 point bomb upgrade that also came with the Firespray-31 ; ( 4 ) Proton Bombs -- an awesome 5 point bomb upgrade exclusive to this ship that can be dropped when you reveal your maneuver dial and deals one FACE UP ( i.e. , critical hit to hull avoiding shields ) to each ship at range one at the start off the activation phase ( this will likely also see some good use on by the Firespray-31 ) , and ( 5 ) Adeline Rush -- a 1 point and one time use elite pilot upgrade that allows you to still take an action after executing a red maneuver.As with all expansions , this one includes all tokens , dials , etc . that you need to use this ship in a game ( though a copy of the base set is still needed to play ) .Given all the nice new things it adds to the Imperial side ( especially the ability to carry some inexpensive and/or very powerful bombs ) , I think it is definitely a worthwhile addition to the game . As noted above , I liked it so much that I bought 5 of them so I could run a full squad of TIE Bombers with some nice upgrades . Definitely take a look around online as you can often find these for less than $ 10 each with free shipping if you buy enough .	1
Nice paint job , great support ship . Love FFG 's X-wing mini 's game . I bought 2 of these , probably will get a 3rd after play testing these ships . Definitely love the Empire over the & # 34 ; rebel scum & # 34 ; .	1
This newest wave brings with it a gift to Imperial SWXW player 's everywhere : The Tie Bomber . This icon was first introduced in the old Decipher card games and it very powerful on it 's onset in this miniatures games . This little guy is slower than it 's predecessors , but packs a much larger punch ! A must have for any X-Wing enthusiast .	1
As with many of the slower , more tanked ships , I have n't found the most strategic uses for it yet . That said , it looks great and has a good set of upgrade cards .	1
For anyone who likes board games , miniature games or Sci Fi in general or Star Wars in particular , this is a great , fun , simple game that can be a beer 'n ' pretzels affair or deeply tactical if you want it to be.The presentation and build of the models and included card stock pieces is first rate . The packaging protective and re-usable and the delivery I received from Amazon was super speedy.The TIE Bomber adds some awesome capabilities and characters to the game . The ability to leave nasty little surprises for those pesky X-Wings on your tail is priceless !	1
same high quality item from manufacturer . an enteresting addition to game play and a much needed addition to the Empire forces . It will be very useful in battling the upcoming releace of the extre large vessals soon to be added to the X-wing game experance	1
The second I opened my new Hawk on the day it came out , my eyes fell on the attack abilities of the ship and , like many others who look at the ship without understanding , my heart groaned : one attack dice ... ONE ? ! But , this was before I started looking at the other cards and the abilities this ship can be stacked with.First , for those like me who hate the one attack dice concept , you can throw on a turret cannon . This accomplishes two things : 1 ) you can now attack in a 360 degree firing arc and 2 ) you remedy the one attack dice issue and can now roll three ( unless you put on an ion cannon turret ) . There is a drawback to this : you have to spend a focus token to fire . Luckily , the Hawk offers an offset to this problem in an operative card.The Hawk includes an operative upgrade card that costs 3 points : the Recon Specialist . This upgrade allows the player to take an extra focus token each turn . To make it even better , the player can spend an extra 3 points to add the Moldy Crow title to the Hawk ( an upgrade specific to this ship type ) . This new title allows the ship to carry over all unused focus tokens , allowing you to stack up piles of focus tokens for future rounds . But the joy of building focus tokens does n't end there , the Hawk includes the pilot Kyle Katarn , who can assign a focus token of his own to any other friendly unit within firing range ( 1-3 ) .While not the best ship out of the box , this little craft can be upgraded to be one of the most formidable support ships in the game .	1
If you love Fantasy Flight Games ' & # 34 ; Star Wars : X-Wing Miniatures , & # 34 ; you really need to pick up the HWK-290 . I was initially quite hesitant to get it , largely because it 's the only ship in the game ( so far ) that did not appear in the Star Wars movies . Rather , I 'm told , the HWK-290 comes from the & # 34 ; Star Wars & # 34 ; expanded universe . Nor was I wowed with this ship 's appearance . It lacks the grace of the TIE Interceptor , the angles of the X-Wing , or the sheer beauty of Imperial Shuttle . As for game play- you need to pick this bad boy up . There are some amazing cards and abilities for the ship . My favorite , by far , is the ability that lets the HWK-290 take a stress token in order to give a friendly attacking ship within range an extra attack dice . This is huge ! It can really turn the tide of your battles , as it has mine . In any event , it is really a great ship to have in your corner when you go toe to toe with the dreaded empire .	1
The HWK-290 is one of four `` Wave 3 '' expansion sets for the X-Wing miniatures game . I think there are some good reasons to add at least one or two HWK-290s to your Rebel fleet.To start on a slightly less positive note , the main thing to keep in mind is that this is a support ship designed to help other ships in your squad . So , while the base stats are less than ideal ( 1 attack dice , 2 defense dice , 4 hull , and 1 shields , plus the focus and target lock actions ) , they have some nice special abilities and upgrades that still make them worthwhile ( including a crew upgrade ) . Further , this is the first expanded universe ship that has been created for the game ( and while it is an interesting choice , it would not have been my first choice of expanded universe ships ... but , at least this really opens up the possibilities for future waves ) On a more positive note , is that it comes with 4 pilots ( including 3 unique pilots with some very nice special abilities ) . Pilots include : ( 1 ) Rebel Operative , a level 2 non-unique pilot that costs 16 points . ( 2 ) Roark Garnet , a level 4 unique pilot that costs 19 points , who has a nice support special ability that reads , `` At the start of the combat phase choose 1 other friendly ship at Range 1-3 . Until the end of the phase , treat that pilot 's pilot skill value as 12 . '' Currently , the highest pilot skill is 9 ( or 11 if you use the Veteran Instincts elite pilot skill ) , so this effectively guarantees your ship will fire before anyone else . ( 3 ) Kyle Katarn , a level 6 unique pilot that costs 21 points , with another nice support special ability that reads , `` At the start of the Combat Phase , you may assign 1 of your focus tokens to another friendly ship at Range 1-3 . `` ( 4 ) Jan Ors , a level 8 unique pilot that costs 25 points , and yet another nice support special ability that reads , `` When another friendly ship at Range 1-3 is attacking , if you have no stress tokens , you may receive 1 stress token to allow that ship to roll 1 additional attack die . '' This can really help another ship offensively , potentially rolling five attack dice under the right circumstances ( this can be especially devastating if the attacking ship happens to have a focus and/or a target lock on the ship that is defending ) .Another nice thing it adds to the game are 6 upgrade cards ( several of which is exclusive to this expansion set at the time it was released ) : ( 1 ) Ion Cannon Turret -- a 5 point upgrade that also came with the Y-Wing ; ( 2 ) Blaster Turret -- a new 4 point upgrade that can also be used on the Y-wing -- it allows you to spend a focus token to attack one ship at range 1-2 with three dice and a 360 degree firing ark ; ( 3 ) Saboteur -- a new 2 point crew upgrade card ( so it can also be used on the YT-1300 , Firespray-31 , or Lambda-Class Shuttle ) that gives you a 50/50 chance of turning a random face down damage card on an enemy ship face up ( i.e. , from a regular hit to a critical hit ) ; ( 4 ) Recon Specialist -- a 3 point crew upgrade ( ditto ) that lets you take two rather than one focus token when you perform a focus action ; ( 5 ) Intelligence Agent -- a 1 point upgrade that lets you look at an opposing ship 's maneuver dial at the start of the activation phase ; and ( 6 ) Moldy Crow -- a unique 3 point title upgrade that allows one HWK-290 ( only ) to keep unspent focus tokens from turn to turn.As with all expansions , this one includes all tokens , dials , etc . that you need to use this ship in a game ( though a copy of the base set is still needed to play ) .Overall , I think this ship adds some nice twists to an already fun game ( especially since so many of the upgrade cards can be used on other ships ) . I do not feel there is a need for an entire squad of them , but I did decide to buy two given the nice special abilities and upgrade cards it adds to the game . Definitely take a look around online as you can often find these for less than $ 10 each with free shipping if you buy enough .	1
The HWK-290 offers some unique options to any X-wing pilot . With an added array of features and abilities , the HWK does not disappoint . It is a little light on weaponry , but has options to be a strong force in any army . I recommend having at least one in your arsenal to augment your forces , although I picked up 2 due to it 's diversity .	1
One thing about this ship is , it comes from the EU , specifically the Dark Forces games . Even though the scale is & # 34 ; correct & # 34 ; it looks a touch too small compared to the other ships . That said , the included cards are really good .	1
The HWK-290 is an expansion for the X-Wing Miniature Game , which happens to include a great model . I had passed , and almost decided not to get , this ship because it is not from the movies , but now I regret not getting this ship earlier . The sculpt and paint job are awesome in this model . So if you ever played Dark Forces and loved the game , you must get this ship . And if you never played the game , you may still want to add this support ship to your collection.This miniature is about 2.25 '' long x 1.5 '' wide . And I believe Fantasy Flight Games to be at scale with other miniatures in the X-Wing Miniature Game such as the X-Wing and Tie Fighters.In addition to the HWK-290 , this expansion includes a stand and a base for the miniature , two ship tokens for the base , one maneuver dial , a rulesheet , and plenty of other tokens as those included for the X-Wing Miniature Game.The cards included in the expansion put this expansion over the top . This expansion includes:4 ships/pilots : Jan Ors ( 8 ) , Kyle Katarn ( 6 ) , Roark Garnet ( 4 ) and a Rebel Operative ( 2 ) ; 3 specialty cards : Saboteur , Intelligence Agent and Recon Specialist2 turret cards : Ion Cannon Turret ( 3 ) , Blaster Turret ( 3 ) 1 title card : Moldy Crow2 reference cards : Modifications and Ion Token.As I look through the cards , I see that the pilots and the title card make this ship a good support for your fighters . The HWK-290 is as agile ( 2 ) as an X-Wing , but a lot less powerful ( 1 ) without a turret card . In addition , it is less maneuverable as it can only perform hard turns at speed 2 , and turns at speed 3 and straight at speed 4 are red . On top of that it has no Koiogran turns . It does have a slightly better hull ( 4 ) , but poor shields ( 1 ) .Overall , this is great model for Star Wars collectors , a good support ship which include a killer nostalgia factor .	1
This ship is an excellent support ship to have flying alongside the falcon or y-wings . Just do n't expect a attack ship . It is a very limited ship without the upgrades.cons : the pins that come with the ships are a little flimsy and are prone to cracking . Fantasy flight needs to put out a replacement pack . With this ship in particular the pin glued to the inside of the ship snapped on the 2nd time we were setting up to play . I will need to glue it back together but I wish they were a little stronger than that .	1
For anyone who likes board games , miniature games or Sci Fi in general or Star Wars in particular , this is a great , fun , simple game that can be a beer 'n ' pretzels affair or deeply tactical if you want it to be.The presentation and build of the models and included card stock pieces is first rate . The packaging protective and re-usable and the delivery I received from Amazon was super speedy.The B Wing adds some awesome capabilities to the game and really kicks but in play ! The H ( a ) WK is a terrific support ship for the Rebel side and quite handy in its own right . The upgrade and support characteristics it adds to the game can be really great .	1
This globetrotting cooperative game of defeating ancient and terrible horrors is a great way to bring a group of friends together to cheer each others successes and moan their defeats . And the defeats will come , believe me ! Arkham Horror is one of favorite games of all time and this is a worthy companion game , especially considering its smaller setup and play time . If there is a bit of advice I could offer it would be to attack the game ! Do not wait to build up resources till you 're comfortable , that 's just the game lulling you quietly to your and the worlds demise.Pros : - Fast setup and play time.- Tense gameplay- Creative storytelling- Sometimes brutal difficultyCons : - Not as in depth adventure as Arkham Horror- Sometimes brutal difficultyYou will get squashed in this game so you might as well enjoy being squashed as a team !	1
Stop me if you 've heard this before , but Fantasy Flight Games has done it again . `` Eldritch Horror '' takes all the things you loved about `` Arkham Horror , '' streamlines them , adds some cool , intuitive new rules , widens the scope , and significantly condenses playing time . This game also reminds me quite a bit of Flying Frog Production 's `` Fortune & Glory . '' I do n't know if I 'll play F & G ; ever again.At its heart , `` Eldritch Horror '' is a story telling game . Players search the globe for clues in order to solve mysteries that will prevent an Elder God from coming back to Earth to destroy humanity . In each location they visit they encounter ghouls or smaller mysteries , usually requiring them to roll dice equal to their specific skill set . Characters also are given the ability to enhance their skills by visiting certain locations . One of my favorite aspects of the game is how when your character dies , you are not eliminated , you simply select a new character to play . Your original character does not just disappear however- he becomes an encounter and your new character or someone else may attempt to gain their fallen comrade 's clues and assets . It 's really a cool mechanic that I have n't seen before , and adds to the thrilling , grand narrative.If you like grand adventure games and enjoy a fun , horror theme , you really need to get your hands on `` Eldritch Horror . '' I 'm already jazzed thinking about what future expansions will bring to this wonderful game !	1
The board consists of a map of the world in old parchment color tones . Once you setup the board with your character standees , other world gates , monsters , and clue tokens , you get a sense of the adventure you 're about to embark on . If you can get behind the below , this game is perfect for your gaming group : - Cthulhu / Lovecraft enthusiasts , or Arkham Horror board game enthusiasts- A small amount of setup but thematic rules make it easy to learn how to play- No plastic miniatures and few dice , but a lot of cards which contain the meat of your adventure- Ultimately a storytelling game through card play and strategy discussion amongst the players- Lots of fun and immersive mechanisms in the game such as having your investigators go insane or defeated , fighting monsters , going to other worlds , encountering and dealing with personal conditions/setbacks , improving skills and gaining items and allies.- Long game of about 3 hours with 4 players and even longer with the full 8 player game	1
This game take some time to play , but it is well worth it . It keeps you on your toes , really hard with two player . It a lot fun . Monster our challenging . And if you die or go insane them you get to pick another player . And keep trying to beat the elder one . It will get you heart pumping and at time you feel like you are going crazy too . It was just a lot of fun .	1
This game is such fun with the right mood - play some music ( look in youtube for & # 34 ; Arkham mix & # 34 ; or similar ) and play with a good group of friends , you do n't need to be role playing but at least read things properly and you 'll have quite a challenge .	1

[ b ] Game [ /b ] -Eldritch Horror [ b ] Producer [ /b ] -Fantasy Flight [ b ] Price [ /b ] - $ 60 [ b ] Set-up/Play/Clean-up [ /b ] - 3 Hours [ b ] TL ; DR [ /b ] -An awesome addition to the FF Cthulhu line 92.5 % [ b ] Basics [ /b ] - The world is under attack ! Creatures from beyond are striking out at our world and bringing the apocalypse with them . Based on the works of H. P. Lovecraft , each player takes the role of an investigator traveling the globe trying to close portals to other worlds , foil fiendish evil plots , and fighting monsters beyond mortal ken . This game is a world spanning epic sequel to Arkham Horror . [ b ] Mechanics [ /b ] - The game move somewhat quickly . Each turn , character get two action that among other things can be moving , resting , shopping , or trading . After that each character encounters events , monsters , or clues on their location . Each location has its own special deck of cards strengthening then theme of the encounter there . Finally , a card indicating what events happen next turn is read from the mythos deck . When the mythos deck runs out , the world is doomed ! To resolve shopping , combat , or encounters , characters start by checking their sheet and look for the appropriate icons to find the number of dice to roll . After the roll , 5 's and 6 's count as successes . For most encounters , one success is needed , but for monsters , you 're successes inflict damage as well as prevent damage to yourself . Monsters also have an additional roll where you must see if your character goes insane from the shear mental trauma of the beyond . The game moves very quickly as the basic conflict resolution is fast , and the rules a pretty intuitive . The game does flatten out some of the dice numbers from Arkham Horror , so that was a shock . I did think some item prices were somewhat high , but all and all the game was fun and that came a lot from the mechanics involved . 4.5/5 [ b ] Theme [ /b ] - The theme of cosmic horror comes out pretty well . Each monster has a deck of events/quests you have to solve to prevent the end of the world . If enough bad things happen , the ancient one awakens and then there is another event to deal with on the back of the ancient one . This deck specific for each ancient evil really does make the game that much more focused . The general mythos deck that makes bad things happen/timer is a little to general , but all and all I really did feel like I was working against one specific cosmic horror . The monsters are a bit of a mix . Monsters are still random , which is n't bad , but it does mean you will fight stuff that by the Lovecraft mythos really does n't belong when you are fighting a different ancient evil . That does take away from a bit of the focus . However , I did that some monsters are special . We had a zombie that became the special zombie hoard . That little touch made the game that much more memorable . The same goes for the mix of encounter cards you get . Instead of a focused game against one cosmic being , you get a bit of a mix . However , it 's not bad , just not the game I hoped for . 4/5 [ b ] Instructions [ /b ] - The instructions are well written . I had no questions on how to play . I did have some minor questions regarding specific in game events , but POOF FAQ up before I even opened the box . High quality too . I hate when a FAQ does n't look like it belongs with the game . Also , the instructions are ONLINE in pdf BEFORE the game was released ! 5/5 [ b ] Execution [ /b ] - This is Fantasy Flight , so instant 5/5 The parts of the game are amazing . [ b ] Summary [ /b ] - This game was n't the exact game I wanted , but it is close enough . Arkham Horror had a bit of a focus problem . This game fixes a lot of that but not completely . I did have a great time and ca n't wait to play again . I want cosmic specific encounters across the board ( mythos deck , region encounter decks etc ) , but I know that would have made this game that much more expensive and would have required about five times as many parts . I 've liked what I saw and can easily recommend this to anyone who 's looking for a world spanning Lovecraft adventure . 92.5 %	1
If you 're familiar with Fantasy Flight 's Arkham Horror you will be right at home playing this game , it 's very similar . It 's streamlined while maintaining much of the depth that made Arkham Horror a hit . Basically you play a group of investigators who travel the world ( game board world map ) fighting monsters while trying to prevent a much worse monster from waking up . Every investigator is different with their own abilities that can be improved . There are weapons to collect , allies to enlist and spells to cast while racing the countdown to doom . Everyone wins or loses the game together , a totally co-operative game . I love Arkham Horror but it takes a lot of dedication to play a game , especially with an expansion . This game is slimmed down just enough so a game takes a few hours instead of all day . The components are the same good quality as Arkham Horror and the rules are mostly clear . There 's a bit of a learning curve but there 's a second rules reference book that answers most questions.Bottom line this is a great game and my favorite solo board game now . I highly recommend it .	1
I have n't really gotten to play this with many people yet , mostly as a single player board game , but it is great as single player . The game is pretty brutal and if you do manage to win a solo game or even a game with other people , you will feel like you accomplished something . The flavor of the game is great and does a good job telling a story for each character . A cool aspect of the game is that when your character dies or goes insane , you can still come across their bodies and & # 34 ; encounter & # 34 ; them as a ghost or crazy person . I think that 's a neat idea and it works really well in this game . I 've never played Arkham Horror , which came before this so I ca n't speak how it compares to that , but I really enjoy this game .	1
This game has such an engaging story line that changes with every game to keep you guessing , I am so happy that I bought this game ... I will never part with it .	1
I purchased this for my son 's birthday . The boys in college love it . This was on a list of gift ideas and my son said it is the best .	1
Fantastic Game ! Basically Pandemic , fighting monsters with weapons . Get a bunch of your friends , team up and stop the monsters .	1
I have a page on Facebook dedicated to AMC 's best hit series , The Walking Dead . I did a caption contest and this was one of the prizes . When I got it in the mail while the contest was going on , I noticed it was nicely packaged and in excellent shape . I definitely recommend this rather you are buying it for yourself or someone else .	1
It 's been said more than a few times ... It 's REAL easy to die REAL fast in this game , and the balance favors the walkers , but then again would n't it anyway ? That being said , I found this one to be pretty entertaining . The board is a rolled mat ( like a fabric mousepad , but but much bigger ) and the pieces are cardboard stock knockouts . Nothing to write home about , but pretty and easy to identify . Players take turns one at a time in a typical round table fashion , rolling a single die and moving that many spaces around the board . Travel is pretty open , as the board pathing is not linear , and certain spaces provide a few different bonuses . In each corner of the board/map is a location . You must travel to each corner and survive the associated encounter to earn a tile for that location . Once you have all 4 tiles , you have to make it back to camp.Not as easy as it sounds.Be prepared to die pretty quick sometimes . My first two games I died before my third turn : - ) It 's hard outside for a zombie survivor . Fret naught , though . If you die , you become a walker and actively attempt to thwart your former fellows and suspend their life privileges . Just try not to die third , or you 'll be sucking wind while your last survivor slowly realizes there 's no hope and kicks the bucket playing KFC to a gaggle of beef jerkyesque automatons.Yes , it can be a pain , but it also can be a TON of fun . Do n't get discouraged.Also , though it 's not obvious , you can play this game solo . However it 's not nearly as much fun that way and you are far more likely to shuffle loose your mortal coil and join the choir carnivorous.I give it 3.795834 stars-J	1
My teenager loves this game and plays with his friends regularly . It 's hard to find gifts for teens and this is a great alternative to video games for walking dead fans .	1
the walking dead board game I was really upset there was only 4 stands yet it comes with 8 game pieces not 4 so if you want 8 people to play you will have to go pend another 40.00 just to get 4 stands that probably cost a penny a piece of the back of the box it say comes with 6game pieces and stands they lied than they had the gaul to go to my facebook and try and rectifie it well I took a picture of the box and putit onmy facebook you would think they would have written sorry we will send you the other 4 stands not the case they want you to have to sopend another 40.00 just to get the other 4 stands so eight can play and than try to pass them selfs off like a normal person I looked up there names they are the ones that wrote it so ofcourse they going to say that but I prove them wrong but im out 40.00 and im terminally ill I can not afford such money just to get 4 stands that are probably a penny a piece so I love amazonits not there fault it the sellers fault for lyning and I really did n't appreciate them going to my facebook trying to pass them selfs off like a nother customer when in fact they were the ones that wrote the rules and the back of the box just buyer beware big time if you are wantuing 8 or even 6people to play you have to spend another 40.00 to get he 4 more stands the right thing to do was to send me the right number of stands and im sure im not the only one this is happen too and I tell you right now there sneaky going onmy facebook they had no right and acting like they were just a person not the persons that wrote on the box and mislead you to believe even 6players there are stil only 4 stands and they have never tried to accommodate me I will never order from them again maybe that 's why I have n't receuived the zombie cards im not sure the company so I do n't want to blame that on them but if they are the same people well sense I still have n't received them I guess I have my nurse go to walmart and buy me those too	1
This game is laid out simply enough , all you need to do is collect the cards at the four corners and avoid turning into a zombie in the process . It takes some strategy though . `` Do I want this bonus or this one ? '' `` Do I go forward or double back ? '' The other cool thing is that your role in the game switches when you lose a battle to a zombie ( roll a die and get a number less than the number on their card ) . Upon becoming Zombified , your new goal becomes making your teammates meet the same fate . Fantastic game , even cooler that it 's based off the show .	1
This kit was a gift for a 9 year old girls birthday . She was excited to receive it , but I do n't know how it performed for her .	1
My 7 year old boy loved this kit . He read through the book and did all of the experiments himself . My 9 year old girl also likes it . After using the kit , they both understand the basics of magnetism ; how to make a nail into a magnet , why a compass points to the north , how the earth acts as a magnet etc . etc . Highly recommended !	1
So glad I could find this on line . My grandson loves science and I could not find anything in the stores . He has enjoyed his Science Wiz .	1
My 7 year old daughter and I enjoyed a few hours around the table playing with this kit . Building the electromagnet was my personal favorite . It was well worth the money for the time we spent together .	1
My daughter has hours of fun with this toy or rather science kit . There are lot of small experiments to understand concepts in magnetism . It is definitely worth for kids to play with this sort of experiments at early age. & # 10004 ; Has multiple projects , not just one & # 10004 ; Everything is in a compact box & # 10004 ; My daughter started exploring on her at age 9 & # 10004 ; Highly motivational . As parents we should encourage and get right things for kids . This is in alignment with MAKER Faire philosophy that people need physical things also to explore and get them motivated on science and math . Highly recommended	1
My teenager really had a good time making these things and he actually learned a thing or two so everyone is happy	1
This was a birthday present for my first-grader and he loves working on with his dad ! It needs something to keep it in , like a plastic box or something , but otherwise it 's great .	1
sent 2 as gifts & the kids really liked them ! I did the first experiment w/my g-son & it was a great learning eyes-on & hands-on experiment about how we can get clean water !	1
We bought this as a part of homeschooling our 4th grader.It required some of my help for holding things in place while my daughter built the circuit , but she could complete 90 % of the work herself . The & # 34 ; inventions & # 34 ; worked well ( minor shortcomings in the blinking light circuit , but it was n't a big deal to us ) .The telegraph was a bit trickier since the placement of the & # 34 ; clicker & # 34 ; had to be just right for it to work . But , it was a good challenge for us because my 4th grader really appreciated the lesson that some ( or most ) things do n't work on the first ( or the second or third ) try . We kept fiddling with it until it worked . When it worked , it was really satisfying.We learned a lot about simple circuits from this kit !	1
The box was smaller than I thought it would be , but the recipient was excited to get started with this . Great gift for the science lover !	1
I have plenty of Energy Wiz kits . They are all very educational . This Light kit one has plenty of nice guided experiments ! & # 10004 ; One WARNING . If you purchased electricity ScienceWiz / Electricity Kit or magnetismScienceWiz Magnetism Experiment Kit and Book 22 Experiments , Magnetismor have large collection of Science Wiz projects , you will see many duplicates here . If you are going to buy only one , this is a great value. & # 10004 ; Has multiple projects , not just one & # 10004 ; Takes about 10 days to explore all experiments .

My husband and 8 year old grandson work on these together . Both of them enjoyed building these and learning how things work . Nice toy !	1
This kit has enough parts to teach my 8-year-old boy about electromagnetism and similar concepts . I 'm happy with it , especially since I was able to use the kit with him .	1
My kindergartner *LOVES* this book ! He actually asks to do it for fun even after the formal part of our homeschooling day is over . The `` map '' aspect is really engaging , and I 've noticed a big improvement in the speed in which he can solve the equations as a result of working through this book . Highly recommended !	1
I bought Subtraction Secrets to give my 5 and 7 year olds something fun to practice their subtraction facts . They have really enjoyed this book ! There are 30 different puzzles , each with a different goal . I.e. , Subtraction Secret # 22 has you navigate your way through alien spaceships to find the one that is friendly . To figure out which one you need to get to , you do 24 different subtraction problems . You start at a star on the map and then solve the problems . Each subtraction problem tells you which direction you need to go from the square you were at before . Once each problem and direction is completed , you have solved the secret . The back of the book has an answer key so children can check their answers.Besides finding friendly aliens , there are also puzzles for finding treasure , kittens , gold , a pet snake , a dog , chocolate candy in a room , and more ! You 'll want to make sure your children know North , East , South , West before starting these puzzles as the directions tell you N , E , S , W as to which direction to move your line to next.I highly recommend this book as a fun and encouraging way for children to reinforce their subtraction facts !	1
I am a young adult . I also love to think different with math . This is a great series ! I do n't recommend fine tip pens for the map though . If you are learning basic programming this might also be an effective tool for some robots . Cause it forces you to understand that in a different . Anyone who wants to can use these not just the grades stated . I still keep up with my basic- complicated facts .	1
My 6-year-old grandson loves the challenges ! I ordered a number of activity-type books for him and , thanks to Amazon , he 's been busy continuing to learn during vacation time .	1
This is the basic Fluxx card game that will change your ideas about `` rules . '' There really are n't any set rules in Fluxx . That 's why it 's called Fluxx ( though I have quickly learned this can also be used as a cuss word . ) The rules are constantly changing , as are the ways in which you can win , so you can kiss any sense of strategy goodbye ! You simply have to go with the flow and luck of the draw . The only thing that can ruin the fun of this fast changing game is the eventual winner . The more they gloat , the less you 'll want to play .	1
As the name says , the rules are in fluxx . Of the variations , I think this is 2nd best ( only beaten by Pirate FluxxPirate Fluxx ) . I do not like the Star FluxxStar Fluxxbecause there are too many additions to most of the keepers .	1
A fun and easy game . If you can read then you can play . It starts of simple . You draw a card and you play a card . Follow the rules on the card and continue until one of many goals are met .	1
Fun game with ever-changing rules . The expansions are fun and add to the game without adding a lot of complexity . The game is easy to learn because the rules are always out on the table .	1
Fluxx is one of my favorite games to bring out with non-gamers . Everyone that I 've played it with has loved it and wanted to keep playing over and over . You ca n't go wrong with this one .	1
This game is awesome . It 's fun just to keep up with the various rules that are created through the gameplay . It 's also very easy for new players to pick up since essentially there are no rules and the rules change throughout the gameplay . As I like to say : & # 34 ; Let 's get fluxxed up ! & # 34 ;	1
++++++++++Quality+++++++++++The cards are beautiful and the words are very easy to read . The card stock could have been better or thicker , but it is definitely not cheap . The game comes in a 2-piece box , which I do n't particularly like . When lifting the box by grabbing it around the sides , you could end up only grabbing the lid of the box , and the cards and rest of the box would just fall out . This is definitely not very travel friendly . For my game , I just use a rubber band to make sure that the box stays together.++++++++++Audience++++++++++This a casual game that players of all ages ( at least those who can read ! ) can enjoy . If you 're looking for a heavy game that takes hours on end to play with tons of strategy , this is not the game you 're looking for . This is more of a game that you play when you have 10-20 minutes of free time while waiting for friends to arrive , and you do n't really care who wins . Games I 've played have ranged from 2 minutes to 1 hour . If you do n't want to get caught in games that span such a long duration , you can enact a house rule where the deck does n't get reshuffled when there are no more cards in the draw deck , and the game ends in a draw.++++++++++Game Mechanics++++++++++Although the game mechanics are very simple ( draw __ cards , play __ cards ) , when I play with new players , they try to read all of the text on each card , which sharply slows down the pace of the game . I have found that you definitely need to keep track of the amount of cards drawn as well as the amount of cards played per turn because of the constantly changing rules . One thing I like to do is have players display the cards they 're playing in front of them as they progress through their turn . That way , we can keep track of exactly how many cards they have played . Then once they have finished their turn , that 's when we resolve the turn by discarding cards that need to be discarded and replace/discard rules currently in play.++++++++++Strategy++++++++++There are many comments here that state that this game requires no strategy and is 100 % based on luck . Although there 's a high level of randomness in this game , not everything is based on luck . As a player , you are forced to follow the rules currently in play to try to accomplish the goal at hand while preventing others from completing the goal . There are many instances where you can easily help other players win with the cards that you currently have in your hand . Oftentimes , you actually help them win simply because you have to follow the rules . You must try to change the goals when they are advantageous to your opponents or try to change the rules in play so that you do n't accidentally help your opponents win . In my experience , although I do strategize to win , I spend more effort strategizing to create disadvantageous situations for my opponents so that they are as far away from winning as possible . This is just as fun as trying to win myself .	1
Great game . It makes for a really good gift to someone and the whole family can play it . Very great game .	1
Account holders wife here giving the review ! The kids ( 8 and 9 years old ) and I play this all the time ! It is great ! I would suggest getting Family Fluxx first to get kids used to the rules and then moving on to this one . Family Fluxx is a bit more friendly ... no Creepers . You 'll just have to buy the game to see what bad things Creepers are and can do ... but they can help you too ! ; ) We have the Monty Python version but have n't played it yet . We keep going back to this one ! You never get the same hand twice ! The replay value is excellent and it does n't take up much room to store it !	1
I like this game a lot . Basically you play the cards you have and follow the rules , but the rules changes with almost every card you play . You need to strategize and pay attention or just go with the flow . I have n't relied the many expansions but I would bet they are also good . I like this game .	1
This is a new kind of card game - it makes for lots of funny quips and conversation and a group think emerges as you play trying to keep up with what you are supposed to be doing now.We were new to the game and it was a bit confusing at first and we laughed and did n't worry about it too much . The second game was worse as we forgot how it worked but winged it and did n't worry about who won or did n't win.Third time was a charm with everyone remembering basic rules and just enjoying the play without messing up too horridly . It 's great at parties and small gatherings- for us at least- we just play and let any rough sides drag.Hope to pick up Fluxx Zombies soon . I think it would make a fine Christmas present for families and young adults , maybe college students . The fun comes from the constant change itself and all the jokes you can make about things like `` I have time but no money '' and 'You never did have a brain . ''	1
Picked this up at the local bookstore a few weeks ago and finally got a chance to break it in last night with the significant other . The first game we played we were both way shaky and a little confused . It was sort of anticlimactic . It can take some time as you read each card ( CAREFULLY ) and try and piece together some sort of strategy which is likely only good at most a couple of rounds . And then suddenly the game is over . The second time we played things started to click and by the third game , we were both getting the hang of it and laughing about it . Mind you , we are still playing the Easy way without the Creeper cards . Definitely do not play this game in a situation where there are lots of distractions . Reading carefully is crucial to this game . I am very pleased with this addition to my game collection and look forward to trying some other varieties as well .	1
I love the Fluxx series so much , and you ca n't go wrong with the original ! Fluxx is the perfect go-to game if you want something fast-paced , fun and easy to learn . Because the explanation and basic rules of the game are so simple , I 've found that it 's equally fun for brand-new players as for those who 've played it before . Everything is explained on each card , so you can give very minimal instructions to new players and they 'll pick it up easily . We usually use this as a warm-up game on game nights with friends and family , before moving on to more strategy-based games.Since I mentioned strategy , I will give you one word of caution : this is not a game for those who are looking for something with elaborate strategy and get frustrated when the plan they 've been working on for several rounds either does n't work out or backfires . The nature of the game is to be ever-changing , so you have to be willing to go with the flow . You can have some strategy , of course , but you have to be willing to see it blow up in front of you in seconds -- and then laugh about it ! A word about the theme versions of the game : I own several of the other versions ( Monty Python Fluxx , Star Fluxx , Oz Fluxx , Zombie Fluxx ) , and this is the version I play with either new players or when I have a mixed group of people in terms of their familiarity with some of the other themes . Monty Python Fluxx , for example , is best played by a group of MP lovers -- this can be played by anyone , and they 'll get the references and the humor !	1
For those of you looking for a cheap , simple and entertaining game , this might be your answer . I had bought this game a long time ago for $ 12 but never had the chance to play it till recently . I played it with a couple of friends and it was a success . It only took me 5 min to read the instructions , explain to everyone and from there on everybody caught up pretty quick . We ended up playing like 10 times and it only took us like 1 hour to do so ! Now , I will first go with the pro 's of this game . I am a board game fan so this is not the top game for me . However , unlike some other extreme board game players , I like to have a large variety of games , games that can be for the overall public , ultra geeks , simple or complex , short or time consuming , etc . Positive factors from this game include : a ) cheap ; b ) Easy to understand ; c ) fast game-time ( there was one game that only took us around 3 min ) ; d ) tons of fun ; e ) perfect for parties or family-time ; f ) fair variability on victory-conditions.Now , to go with the negative aspects , I really do n't think there are any as a general board game viewer . However , viewing the game as an ultra board game lover , I would have to say that this game is fairly simple for gamers that are fans of hardcore boardgames and they probably would n't find this appealing . On the other hand , the cards can fade-off with play , but this issue can be corrected by buying card game sleeves ( they are cheap , should n't spend more than 3 bucks getting a pack ) . Even if you dont ' buy sleeves , this game is so cheap that by the time cards start ruining you have probably enjoyed it for many years.Overall , I think this game is great , for those of you just wanting something cheap and fun to play with the family or friends and that is not very time consuming this can be your choice . Have fun ! !	1
This is my 2nd Fluxx card deck . It 's such a great game that I keep one both in the house and in the car . My friends and I are addicted to the game ; clearly our favorite game . We 've played with as many as 14 ! It 's easy to teach , changes every time , is a lot of fun , and a hand can usually be played 15 minutes . What I like about the game is that , at parties , it is easy for someone to step into the game and out of the game at any time . If I have a lot of guests over playing a variety of games , I can play one or two hands of Fluxx before moving on elsewhere and then come back for another hand or two .	1
A great game for two or more players ! Such silly fun ! We own nearly all of the Fluxx games . Highly recommend them .	1
different every time you play it . Some games take 5 minutes . sometimes they are over an hour . Great for quick plays at home or on the go .	1
This game is so fun and dynamic . It can be super quick , or it can take a little longer . This version is really great for families , but I 'm aware that there are other versions that might appeal a little more to adults . The game itself is the same , though .	1
If you have never played Fluxx but you enjoy card or board games then give it a try . They have several flavors ( themes ) and each can play a little different . This is the original and a great starting point if you are new to the game 's mechanics .	1
This one is another game that is easy to pick up quickly and is fun for groups.We have played through it maybe 30 times - and each time is a bit different . I am probably going to pick up a few of the expansions to increase the variety of this game .	1
Fluxx is a card game for 2-6 players created by Andrew Looney . It 's tagline is that it is & # 34 ; The Card Game With Ever-Changing Rules ! & # 34 ; - and it truly lives up to this name . When it comes to new players , all I need to tell them is this : & # 34 ; Draw one . Play one. & # 34 ; Those are the most basic rules of the game . But what is the objective ? How does one win a game of Fluxx ? We 'll find out during the course of the game itself.Your basic Fluxx deck has several types of cards . At first everyone will have limited options given they have to follow the basic rules - draw one card from the deck and play one card from the deck . However the deck includes New Rules , which include manipulating how many cards are drawn or played or even how many cards you can have in hand . In order to win , you need to meet the condition/s of whichever goal card/s is/are in play at the moment . Since goals are also cards , any player can introduce a new goal , thus changing things up . And there are slightly more complex Action cards that have you do different things like drawing a second hand of cards to manipulate or gives all players a new card to work with.Meeting goals is simple enough - most of them involve having certain Keeper cards in play . And keepers are seemingly random items like a Rocket or an Eye . But they gain meaning when you look at the goal cards like the need to have the Keeper cards for Milk and Cookies to achieve , well , Milk and Cookies . But there are also annoying cards call Creepers which you have to play when you draw them and typically they prevent you from winning . But there are still Goal cards that actually require Creeper cards , so things can get pretty interesting.Thus the game is pretty easy to learn at its most basic level , but at times actually winning can seem like almost random affair . But the strategy of the game really comes into play when you try to figure out how to make the most of the cards that you have in your hand right now . It 's a game that requires quick thinking and tests how well you can come up with a plan with only so many cards in hand and of course a limited number of cards that you can actually play.Fluxx games can be very quick when a lucky player has the right number of Keepers in play early on . But they can also drag on for a significant period of time , especially when New Rules like Hand Limit 0 or Play All get involved . Being forced to play every single card that you have can get pretty tiring , but even then it 's still possible to salvage victory - it 'll probably just take you a while.Fluxx is a nice little gateway game that is great in terms of introducing new players to the wider range of tabletop games out there beyond the likes of Snakes & Ladders or Monopoly .	1
This is such a fun game . My friends introduced me to it at a get together and I had to get my own deck . It was impossible to find in stores , but yay , Amazon has everything . : - ) This game is fun for adults , teens , even my 12 year old video-game obsessed son loves this game and asks me to play it all the time .	1
The rules are always changing but you catch on fast . When I first played this game I was confused as ever but now I am a master after a few rounds . Highly recommend you get this and combine it with several of the other versions .	1
My family and friends hate this game for some reason , but my girlfriend and I love it and play it together once or twice a week . We love the moral dilemmas involved : whom to let die , Hitler or Reagan ? It 's a real toss-up ( I usually choose Reagan ; I feel that he did more damage ) . I would n't bother with the expansions , as they will probably be more of the same , just with a few more cards . One of this type of game in your possesion is enough .	1
this is a great filler . You play a time traveler attempting to be the first to get home . There are three ways to win- collect specific artifacts , have ten cards in hand at the end of your turn , or meet specific timeline requirements . The third option is the core of the game . There are 32 time cards arrayed in a grid on the table . Each card represents a year . Some years can be directly modified by playing cards in your hand . These are called Linchpin cards . Flipping a Linchpin results in a change in history . What happens if Lincoln is n't assassinated ? Or the Challenger never blew up ? Each change in history has a ripple effect . Events in future years can be changes , creating paradoxes in time . These paradoxes can be & # 34 ; patched & # 34 ; with different events which the players can try to use to get home.If you like lots of card interaction , fun mechanics , and a game that takes about 15-20 minutes to play , this is a great choice .	1
My older tweens and young teens LOVE this game . I can see it holding their interest for a while to come . It plays like a board game but packs up small like a card game -- great to pack for trips . Buy along with Fluxx for younger kids or different moods , and everyone is happy !	1
I first played this game about ten years ago with my friends as freshman in college . It 's a great game that takes a bit of time to understand the many rules , but once you do , you 'll get hooked.This newer addition has added Gadgets and a few other new cards to mix up the game . It 's easily a family game , but not for kids under 6 I would guess as the rules can be pretty complicated . It 's also a great way to enjoy elements of history and play with the ideas of how connected major events could be in history .	1
Great game from the creators of Fluxx . Alter the timeline in this fun and dynamic time-traveling game . Collect artifacts like a convincing copy of the Mona Lisa , a sports almanac from the future , or even live dinosaurs while changing the course of history to get back to your home timeline . This is a great game to play with three or four history buffs . What do you think would happen if John Lennon survived his assassination ?	1
I play tabletop games on at least a weekly basis . I really like Chrononauts because of the unique gameplay mechanisms . I love the idea of creating your own timeline . My boyfriend always tried to legalize marijuana , no matter what his identity ( in the game ) . I like that there are a few ways to win . There is really no way to know who is ahead in this game . Anyone can win unexpectedly . The text on the cards is cute and funny . The games usually end within a reasonable amount of time ( e.g . within an hour ) and anyone can win . Even my mom won at Chrononauts because someone else accidentally patched up her timeline right before her turn . I have the Gore Expansion and Early American Chrononauts . I combine Chrononauts with the Gore Years but not with Early American . I tried that , but it is just too much crap on the table . It gets a little hectic .	1
`` Chrononauts '' is another card game by the creators of `` Fluxx . '' The general premise is that you 're a time traveler from an alternate timeline ( not the history we know , but some alternate history ) who has to return home.You play on an 8 x 4 grid of cards that represents the `` timeline . '' Each card in the grid shows a historical event like the JFK assassination or the Lincoln assassination . As the game progresses , players play cards that `` alter '' the timeline - for example , if JFK was just injured , but was n't actually assassinated , that would have a ripple effect on events further down the timeline and might create paradoxes.While the timeline is getting altered , players can also play `` artifacts '' which represent the player visiting a given point of history and stealing something historically significant , like the Mona Lisa.You can win the game by either changing the timeline to match the alternate history you come from or by retrieving a specific target set of artifacts . Everyone loses if too many paradoxes are created in the timeline.The game takes a little bit to get into because , while the rules are simple , it 's not immediately clear how the timeline `` ripple effects '' work . You 'll figure it out soon enough by playing the game , but it might take a few turns before it truly clicks . It might be good to play the first game with everyone just showing their cards to the group so folks can help each other through . Once you figure it out , start over and play `` for real . `` The educational aspect of this game is in the historical timeline . If you 've got people unfamiliar with some of the events or why changing this event might alter the course of history and affect that event , it can bring up some interesting conversation . For kids , it might get them interested in finding out more about those events . That said , it is n't a history lesson itself - there 's not , like , a bunch of details about the events , just general chronology.Once you figure out the gameplay and the strategy , it gets to be a pretty competitive and fun game . It 's easy to set up and does n't take a ton of room . The product description says it takes 20 - 45 minutes to play , but the first time through it took closer to an hour because we were working through all the ins-and-outs of play . I think you could probably get it close to the 40 minute range , but unless cards fell exactly right , I do n't know that I 'd count on a 20 minute game .	1
We 've tried nearly all the Fluxx games and this is definitely our favorite . It 's the only version where having Creeper cards is usually an advantage , so we welcome those Zombies into the family with open ( albeit bloody ) arms ! Not the best Fluxx game to start with if you 've never played Fluxx before . We 'd recommend starting with the Original Fluxx for that . But if you have a bit of experience , you 'll catch on to Zombie in no time , groaning all the way !	1
This game uses the original Fluxx rules , and thrusts them squarely into a zombie theme -- and , surprisingly , it works very , very well . The game play is relatively straightforward : ( 1 ) collect `` keeper '' cards in front of you while avoiding zombie cards , ( 2 ) play `` global '' cards that change the rules of the game , ( 3 ) attempt to collect the right combination of `` keeper '' cards to satisfy the ever-changing goal conditions.This game can be played as a standalone set and is also compatible with any of the Fluxx sets , although I 've found that the game play is usually a bit stilted and less enjoyable with other sets mixed in.Each card contains its own set of rules that affect game play , so each card contains ( often substantial ) text.The game is fairly flexible in terms of the number of players it can accommodate , but somewhere between 3-5 is probably best . If you stick to those numbers , a game will usually take around 15-30 minutes . ( 2 player games are generally not much fun ) .Overall , the game is portable , fast-paced , and often amusing.APPROPRIATE AUDIENCE : Hardcore gamers will enjoy this as a `` warm-up '' between their more complicated gaming sessions . It 's also a very useful tool for introducing newcomers to these kinds of games.Finally , this particular set is , of course , zombie themed -- in other words , if the player does n't enjoy zombie jokes , you are better off getting a different set of Fluxx cards ( Star Fluxx for sci-fi fans , Cthulhu Fluxx for Lovecraft fans , etc ) .OVERALL SCORE : B- The game is a lot of fun , but can get tedious if played too often .	1
Looney Labs ' Zombie Fluxx is a variation on their popular Fluxx card game , introducing a new kind of card type to lend even more craziness to what is already a nutty card game.COMPONENTS:100 cards and a set of instructions . The cards are not plastic/linen coated , but seem fairly durable . The cards consist of six types : Goal , Action , Basic Rules , New Rule , Keeper , and Creeper . ( The Creeper cards are new to the Zombie Fluxx variant of Fluxx . ) GAME PLAY : Trying to describe gameplay is difficult since one of the fun elements of the game is that the winning conditions ( Goal ) are unknown before the game starts . Not only this , but the rules of the game change as New Rule cards are played.To begin , each player is dealt three cards . If a player receives a Creeper card , zombies in this variant , the zombie is immediately laid down and another card drawn to replace it.The Basic Rules card is laid down . That card tells the players to draw a card and play a card . Any one of the cards the player has in hand can be played . Those playable cards belong to one of four types : GOAL cards , when played , will determine the winning conditions for the game . Playing a new Goal card will eliminate the previous goal ( in most cases , depending on new rules currently in force ) . A special Ungoal card even makes it possible for the zombies to win and all the players lose.KEEPER cards are used to satisfy the Goal card 's winning conditions . For instance , if the Goal is to have the car and the shotgun Keeper cards and a player has played those cards , that player wins.ACTION cards tell the player to perform a particular action , such as steal a Keeper from another player or discard a hand and draw a new one.NEW RULE cards modify how the game is played . A rule might now be to draw three cards or to groan whenever a zombie is drawn . A rule of a particular type overrules a previously played rule of the same type , the older rule being discarded . Rules can stack up ( though Action cards exist to remove rules ) .The Creeper cards , zombies in this case , also have their own rules . The zombies come in singles , pairs , trios , and quartets.The constant shifting of the rules and goals makes for insane game play . Add in the `` anti-Keeper '' Creeper cards and this version of Fluxx is even nuttier than the original.PROS : * No round of this game ever plays the same twice . * Game length varies due to the combined effects of New Rule and Goal cards . * Utterly unique gameplay makes the game fresh for seasoned card players . * The frantic nature of play with changing rules and goals makes for some real nailbiting . * One of the best games out there for severely sticking it to other players . * The humorous illustrations on the cards and the sheer inanity of some of the goals , rules , and actions keeps people laughing -- or groaning . * Fluxx expansion packs will work with Zombie Fluxx , too . ( Though Zombie Fluxx has color illustrations on the card fronts , while the other Fluxx card images are B & W ; line drawings . * Simple enough for kids ages 8 and up . * Dude , it 's got zombies ! CONS : * Though definite strategies exist to play for a winning hand , they are all too easily undone by some of the Action cards and Goal changes , making the game a little too random for some players . * The cards , though sturdy , could still use a linen finish ( although this would make them look different from older expansion pack sets . ) * Should the rules pile up ( more than five or six ) , people often forget to abide by all of them . This is especially true of younger players . * Despite simple gameplay , the complexity of variations of rules , actions , and goals can bewilder players unfamiliar with the game ( though repeated play will break them in quickly ) . Many of the cards have explanatory text that should be read to all players or else they will not follow what is going on , especially if unfamiliar with the game . * Serious card players wo n't see the sense in a game like this.CONCLUSION : Once people get the hang of this game , it works . It 's simple to pick up , though impossible to master . Anyone can win , either through smart play or dumb luck . The tongue-in-cheek nature of the concept makes for a lot of fun , too.Definitely a winner , and probably the best game in the Fluxx series . That it can be combined with other Fluxx card packs only makes it better .	1
This game is so simple to teach , and so fun to play , that it has quickly become our favorite game . It 's perhaps not the easiest Fluxx to start with ( Family Fluxx is easier ) , but it 's just loads of fun . The basic rules are easy enough : On your turn , you draw a card and you play a card . Generally . Except there are cards that change the rules and they WILL be played . The rule change takes effect the moment it 's played , which leads to all sorts of interesting strategies about when to play what & # 8230 ; Even the game 's objective can change . That 's why it 's called Fluxx . : ) Creepers behave a little differently than other variants like Star Fluxx in that zombie creepers do n't actually attach to anything , which simplifies the mechanic a little for players who might otherwise think that 's a complicated aspect of the game . It 's really not & # 8212 ; the only complexity is that when you draw a zombie , it goes directly into play in front of you and you draw a card to replace it.If you like Fluxx , or zombies , or are into preparedness ( if you 're prepared for the & # 34 ; zombie apocalypse & # 34 ; , you 're ready for anything , right ? ) , or you just want a fun way to spend a bit of time with a friend or three , pick up this game !	1
A fun , fast and easy to learn card game with high replayability ! Every time you play Fluxx it changes . The cards change . The goals change . The game can end in one play or 40 minutes later , this is what makes it so fun , or frustrating ! The Zombies are the Creepers in this version of Fluxx , and there are certain cards that can also turn your friends ( Keepers ) into zombies as well . Other cards can undo that , as well as make the Goals ( which most say you can not win with Zombies ) allow you to be able to win with zombies . There are a lot of fun elements with this version and it does combine with most other Fluxxes ( although not Martian , which I just purchased and found out ) . I love everything Zombie so this one gets played a LOT with our various gaming groups ! Highly recommended !	1
Love this game . My whole family likes to play it . we even have the normal version and they love to play that game too .	1
Flux is already a great game and then you add in zombies too ? What fun ! Flux is a game where the rule and objective cards change as you play the game . The zombie theme was very thought out in this version and is fully integrated into the game very well .	1
I love this game , its confusing at first , but its so much fun . I play it with my friends at college and my friends at school ! Its fun for any age and it was worth it !	1
This game is simple and fast paced , wide variety of ways to comically stab your friends in the back . Variety of zombies to effect gameplay in different ways each time . I plan on buying the Monty Python edition next as it offer numerous rules of increasingly idiotic fun . Would gladly recommend to a friend !	1
If you have played any of the Fluxx games , you know how to play this one . It has a Zombie Theme ( Surprise ? ) . A quick game , with replay value , humor , and a decent light-hearted competition between the players , this game is good for a few people without the time or inclination to play a more difficult game . The rules are simple ( although they can change throughout the game via the cards ) , you draw a specific number of cards , can hold a specific number of cards , and can play a specific number of cards -- while trying to stay clear of zombies . Cards change the number you can draw , hold and play , as well as the specific cards you need in front of you to win the game . Cards can be stolen , wiped away , and a goal change can take all your hard work and wash it down the drain -- or cause you to win in an instant , out of sheer luck .	1
This is the first of several Fluxx games that we have purchased . We own almost all of them now . It 's one of the more challenging of the Fluxxes ( if that 's a word.. ) b/c there are so many Creeper cards , but it so much fun ! Highly recommend this .	1
This is a great game but the KEEPER cards were lacking in their abilities to make them worthwhile . The artwork is fantastic and campy . The theme is great but could of been more enjoyable if their KEEPER cards were as useful as the KEEPER cards in Martian FLUXX .	1
Zombie Fluxx is a entry in the line of 'Fluxx ' card games . It is not an expansion , but a separate game fully playable by itself.What you get : One set of rules.One Fluxx Adand100 Cards divided into several categories : ( 15 ) Keepers- Cards that represent positive things , such as friends , gasoline , shotguns , etc . Most Goals require certain Keepers . ( 15 ) Creepers- If Keepers are cards you want , Creepers are the ones you do n't . They represent Zombies ( 24 ) New Rules- The cornerstone of Fluxx . The Rules constantly change with these cards . ( 23 ) Actions- Cards that are one time playable and resolved as soon as played . ( 21 ) Goals- These cards are placed , one at a time , as victory conditions for the game . They constantly change . ( 1 ) Ungoal- This particular card allows for a complete defeat of all players . ( 1 ) Basic Rules- The first card to sit on the table . It tells players to Draw one , and play one every turn.All of these lovely cards are contained within a box , in which they lay divided in half.Gameplay : Start with each player getting 3 cards . Draw one , Play one . Easy , right ? Well , kinda . Until the new rule cards come out that have you groaning like a zombie as you draw a Zombie Creeper , or drawing four cards at a time instead of one . But enough about the rules , you need to know what the goal is , right ? Well the goal changes just as often as the rules . If you thought that an outbreak of Zombies is a thing of chaos , just wait until the ever-changing rules and goals of Zombie Fluxx get you.There is a Flame-Thrower expansion for this deck , as well as Promo packs to help expand your addiction.In conclusion : I recommend Zombie Fluxx for both gamers , and non-gamers alike . We use it as a diversion from more serious games , or as a closer for the night .	1
This version of Fluxx is pretty fun . Like another reviewer stated , this probably is n't the best version for only two . However , I should mention that this is the best Fluxx game for more than 5 people : More than 3 folks starts to stretch the basic game 's resources a little thin . I 've played Fluxx with 4-5 people three times , and not a single game lasted uner one hour . One even lasted close to two , until we mutually agreed to stop playing.This version is best with a larger group , or more than two folks in general . The Creepers add a zany strategy to the game ( earning a 2 education rating ) : do you keep them for a future goal requiring them to win , or do you lose them for a likewise requiring goal ? You count stuff , when you draw , so I ca n't really give it a one star in Education . The art may not be for kids , as the zombies scared a couple of them , but the adults enjoyed this version more than the basic version . ( Being horror fans may have helped also ) .If you have never bought a Fluxx game before , I recommend this one and using the `` No Zombies '' variant until you 've learned the rules ( that change often ) and goals ( that change often as well ) . You do n't get some of the Fluxx basic cards ( Inflation , for example ) , but the fact is , you 're paying a couple of dollars more for more cards .	1
Especially when you 're the zombie boss ! This game can be really quick or take forever depending on the people you play it with and the cards you get . Still lots of fun to play with people who have never played the Fluxx series before .	1
We have a great time playing with our 7 and 9 year old girls . They picked up the game in one round and have a blast .	1
I love Zombie Fluxx almost as much as I love Martian Fluxx.The conceit is that the players are survivors . Keepers are stuff like axes and shotguns and just about any other useful anti-zombie thing you 've come across in your viewing of the canonical material.Creepers are Zombies , some with an extra card mechanic that moves them around and that requires the owner be vigilant and a careful reader.Play is the usual Fluxx affair , defining and re-defining the game as it goes . There are no `` interrupt play '' type cards in this deck , those being a later addition to the basic Fluxx Mechanic , though there are some themed New Rules.For even more fun , do what I did and order the flamethrower expansion , which comes with more zombie Creepers and the flamethrower you need to get rid of them . The instructions tell you to put these creepers in other Fluxx decks rather than the Zombie Fluxx one . Ignore this advice . Soon your Zombie Fluxx Game will be properly overrun with crowds of Zombies spilling onto the floor , just like they should be.Recommended .	1
another fluxx card game . have n't played this version yet but got it for the boys.slow learning and getting into it , but when you do , it is fun . like that you can add cards .	1
We play this game a lot in our house . My son is 8 and loves it . We 've mixed the original fluxx with zombie and enjoy it very much . I just ordered the star and martian versions and plan on mixing those decks . We also have a group of friends that love playing this game that we get together with often . We 've introduced this game to many of our friends and we always have a good time . It 's easy to learn and fun to play !	1
Be sure to brush up on your Monty Python before you play this version of the Fluxx card game ! It would really help to watch at least one Monty Python movie first , as there may be a couple of times you 'll have to sing a song or recite lines of dialogue . And if you or ANY of your fellow players do n't know anything about Monty Python , forget it . Simply choose another version of Fluxx , because playing Fluxx is supposed to be fun for everybody . Note that this Fluxx version is for a slightly older age range and will likely take a bit longer than other versions just because of the Monty Python aspects and the inevitable arguments that will take place as to whether `` Ni ! '' is actually a line of dialogue . ; - )	1
I love anything related to Monty Python and this game does not let down on that front at all , every card is related to Monty Python . If you like games that basically have no strategic point and almost no ability to predict what is going to happen at all then you will like this game . If you like strategy and planning you will be frustrated by the randomness in this game . It is hilarious and if you have a fun game group you will like this ! Fun .	1
Some of the cards in Monty Python Fluxx have you performing songs or quotes from the movie , so it really pays to be nuts for Monty Python . The other Fluxx games do n't seem to have such a strong dependency on knowing a certain subject well , so this is `` hard Fluxx '' in my opinion . It 's still lots of fun , and I have had quite a bit of practice with my sparrow quotes and singing the Lumberjack song after playing a few games of this.Great fun !	1
Looney Labs ' Monty Python Fluxx is a variation on their popular Fluxx card game , expanding on the updated game play first introduced in Zombie Fluxx . The added bonus is the insanity of the Pythons , for this game includes dead parrots , knights that say `` Ni ! '' and not even one morsel of cheese.COMPONENTS:100 cards and a set of instructions . The cards are not plastic/linen coated , but seem fairly durable . The cards consist of six types : Goal , Action , Basic Rules , New Rule , Keeper , and Creeper.GAME PLAY : Trying to describe gameplay is difficult since one of the fun elements of the game is that the winning conditions ( Goal ) are unknown before the game starts . Not only this , but the rules of the game change as New Rule cards are played.To begin , each player is dealt three cards . If a player receives a Creeper card , mostly evil creatures from `` Monty Python and the Holy Grail '' in this variant ( and , of course , the Spanish Inquisition , which no one expects ) , the Creeper is immediately laid down and another card drawn to replace it.The Basic Rules card is laid down . That card tells the players to draw a card and play a card . Any one of the cards the player has in hand can be played . Those playable cards belong to one of four types : GOAL cards , when played , will determine the winning conditions for the game . Playing a new Goal card will eliminate the previous goal ( in most cases , depending on new rules currently in force ) .KEEPER cards are used to satisfy the Goal card 's winning conditions . For instance , if the Goal is to have the Holy Grail and Holy Hand Grenade of Antioch Keeper cards and a player has played those cards , that player wins.ACTION cards tell the player to perform a particular action , such as steal a Keeper from another player or sing a classic Python song to gain an extra play.NEW RULE cards modify how the game is played . A rule might now be to draw three cards or to talk with an outrageous accent . A rule of a particular type overrules a previously played rule of the same type , the older rule being discarded . Rules can stack up ( though Action cards , such as My Brain Hurts ! , exist to remove rules ) .The Creeper cards may also have their own rules . The Knights Who Say `` Ni ! '' are defeated if any card with `` It 's '' is in play.The constant shifting of the rules and goals makes for insane game play . Add in the `` anti-Keeper '' Creeper cards and this version of Fluxx is even nuttier than the original.PROS : * No round of this game ever plays the same twice . * Game length varies due to the combined effects of New Rule and Goal cards . * Utterly unique gameplay makes the game fresh for seasoned card players . * The frantic nature of play with changing rules and goals makes for some real nailbiting . * A great game for severely sticking it to other players . * The humorous illustrations on the cards and the sheer inanity of some of the goals , rules , and actions keeps people laughing -- or singing `` The Lumberjack Song . `` * Fluxx expansion packs will work with Monty Python Fluxx . You can combine other full Fluxx decks , too . ( Though Monty Python Fluxx has color illustrations on the card fronts , while some of the older Fluxx game card images are B & W ; line drawings . ) * Simple enough for kids ages 8 and up . * Dude , it 's got Nude Organists ! CONS : * Though definite strategies exist to play for a winning hand , they are all too easily undone by some of the Action cards and Goal changes , making the game a little too random for some players . * The cards , though sturdy , could still use a linen finish ( although this would make them look different from older expansion pack sets . ) * Should the rules pile up ( more than five or six ) , people often forget to abide by all of them . This is especially true of younger players . * Despite simple gameplay , the complexity of variations of rules , actions , and goals can bewilder players unfamiliar with the game ( though repeated play will break them in quickly ) . Many of the cards have explanatory text that should be read to all players or else they will not follow what is going on , especially if unfamiliar with the game . ( In Monty Python Fluxx 's favor { or detriment , depending on how you look at it } , it 's less chaotic than Zombie Fluxx . ) * Serious card players wo n't see the sense in a game like this . ( But then again , who wants to play a game like this with serious card players ? ) CONCLUSION : Once people get the hang of this game , it works . It 's simple to pick up , though impossible to master . Anyone can win , either through smart play or dumb luck . And if you know what `` Nudge , Nudge , Wink , Wink ! '' means , you 'll eat this game up.Monty Python Fluxx is the second game in the Fluxx series that uses Creeper cards , the other being Zombie Fluxx . The two games do play differently , though . Zombie Fluxx comes packed with Creepers ( the Zombies ) , while Monthy Python Fluxx has only a half dozen . But while Zombie Fluxx gives you plenty of ways to get rid of your Creepers , Monthy Python Fluxx does not , making it tougher to win if you 're stuck with one.Monty Python Fluxx and Zombie Fluxx -- which to choose ? A tough call . Zombie Fluxx 's gameplay makes it more possible for someone to win in a wild combination of moves that requires a lot of forethought -- or just plain dumb luck . Monty Python Fluxx 's gameplay is more straightforward . In that , it may actually be the more mental game . Shrewd gameplay rewards players more often than in Zombie Fluxx . Still , the even better question may be , Why not buy both and shuffle the decks together ? Indeed , what could be better than going after the Killer Rabbit with a chainsaw ? Or dispatching a quartet of zombies with Excalibur ? Talk about making tasty brains hurt !	1
I had previously purchased Cthulhu Fluxx and to be honest unless you are a Lovecraft fan , the cards and their humor get a bit lost as you have to explain what certain cards mean and their significance.This Fluxx however is amazingly fun , and would be even to those who may not be familiar with the subject material . The game is easy learn and play , and even if you do n't understand some of the things referenced in the cards , the sheer ridiculous nature of the references allow hilarity to ensue.A personal favorite card of mine included with this Fluxx is : New Rule , If you speak with an outrageous accent during your turn , you may draw an additional card . If you maintain this accent until your next turn , you may draw an additional two cards . Suffice to say , keeping a straight face while playing this Fluxx is nearly impossible .	1
I love the Fluxx series so much , and while I may play some of the other versions more often ( I 'll explain why at the end of this review ) , this is by far my personal favorite ! ! ! ! Fluxx is the perfect go-to game if you want something fast-paced , fun and easy to learn . Because the explanation and basic rules of the game are so simple , I 've found that it 's equally fun for brand-new players as for those who 've played it before . Everything is explained on each card , so you can give very minimal instructions to new players and they 'll pick it up easily . We usually use this as a warm-up game on game nights with friends and family , before moving on to more strategy-based games.Since I mentioned strategy , I will give you one word of caution : this is not a game for those who are looking for something with elaborate strategy and get frustrated when the plan they 've been working on for several rounds either does n't work out or backfires . The nature of the game is to be ever-changing , so you have to be willing to go with the flow . You can have some strategy , of course , but you have to be willing to see it blow up in front of you in seconds -- and then laugh about it ! A word about the theme versions of the game : this particular version is really best played when you 're playing with others who know and love Monty Python . Several of the actions of the game give you bonuses based on your knowledge of the MP canon , including being able to quote from their show/movies or sing songs . It is playable with people who do n't know MP , but I do n't think it 's as much fun for them . I own several of the other versions ( original Fluxx , Star Fluxx , Oz Fluxx , Zombie Fluxx ) , and while I love this one the most ( closely followed by Star Fluxx ) , I do make sure to play it with my MP-obsessed friends .	1
Of watching Monty Python movies in the summer time . I liked this game because it 's true to the MP movies and makes you remember lines from the movies and quoting them and even some singing . The singing was a bit silly , but it 's only on one or two cards and hey it 's fun ! Re play is high as well .	1
Monty Python 's Fluxx is a pythonization of the popular Fluxx game that produces many laughs.The basic rules are simple draw one and play one , however the draw rules the play rules , the hand size rules and even the victory conditions can change with the play of a card.This is Fluxx but with python you get keepers like the Hand of God that can change things , the Knights who say Ni , rules that count `` 1-2 , 5 ( 3 sir ) '' and actions that can be taken if the rules get `` Much too Silly ! `` The game can run 5 min or an hour you never know , its a perfect reserve game to have handy if you are waiting for part of your game group to make it . It says up to 6 but you can play with more without trouble.This is a winner and a must for Python fans and with the economy tough it is a cheap and fun evening at home . Get it .	1
My boyfriend loves Monty Python and Fluxx , so this was the perfect combo ! He knew what all the cards meant ... unlike me who has n't watched the movies , haha : P	1
A fun version of the Fluxx card game that I would definitely buy again . Lots of wacky combinations of alien technology and weird rules . Fluxx is always a challenge due to its ever-changing rules , goals and actions . Be prepared to laugh a lot with this one , even if it 's only two of you playing .	1
I have several of fluxxs games , this is one of the other fun fluxx to play with . we are those aliens try to destroy humans . hahah .	1
we play it all the time . Itt is a fun game we play a lot of cards and this looked different and it is . Great fun for anyone who can read .	1
I think the funnest element of Martian Fluxx is that players are the Martians coming to take over Earth ! How cool is that ? My biggest dislike , however , is that unlike other Fluxx games , this one is not combinable due to that aspect . All the same , this is highly replayable and a super cool and fun Fluxx . I like the `` Martian Technology '' cards , which allow you to kill humans , sneak peeks at other players cards during your turn ( unless they have a tin foil hat , lol ) , and even abduct humans with the Abduction Chamber , allowing you to hide them underneath this card and not count against win goals , but can be revealed at any time ( in case you need them FOR win goals . This can also hurt you , however , as I found out , when another player steals your technology and leaves you with a bunch of filty humans , which , in case you have n't figured out , are the Creeper cards for this version of Fluxx , lol . A ton of fun though , and highly recommended to all who love Fluxx or card/board games in general . Very easy to catch on and just a fun and random game to kill the time . I 've yet to meet anyone who dislikes Fluxx !	1
Great fun ! We own nearly all of the Fluxx games and enjoy them all ! ! Highly recommend any of them . Great for two or more players .	1
This game has quite a nifty martian theme and plays better than its sister game ZOMBIE FLUXX . The keeper cards have more redeemable value and add more to the gameplay . I picked this up on a whim and now enjoying every minute of it . A light game with a sci fi theme . Its family fun all around when it comes to Looney Labs !	1
Fluxx is a gnomic , a game you define as you play it . At the start there is no goal and you simply draw a card and play a card . That changes fast as cards are played that define new rules and goals.The conceit for this deck is that the players are Martians invading Earth . Goals are themed accordingly , drawing on Hollywood , Ed Wood and popular knowledge . I find them hysterically funny.There are Action cards that are pretty much the same in all Fluxx variants . The keepers ( cards that enable you to achieve goals ) are stuff like cows and ray guns and Martian teleporter booths - again side splitting in context and can be combined to form a number of clever visual puns in the goal cards . The creepers ( cards you must play and that usually prevent you from winning but not always in this variant ) are mostly Pathetic Humans , but there are also the dreaded Germs and Army cards . Again , in context , they make for an amusing and nifty mechanism as well as offering a neat win possibility.Special for this deck is the Martian Tech , a subset of the Keepers that allow all sorts of nifty things to be done by the owning player.Fluxx is a short-term tactical game in which the win is almost always a lucky spur-of-the-moment thing , and the play value can be diminished because of that , but for a quick game with no real limits on numbers of players ( I 've had as many as 9 at the table in one game ) it ca n't be beat.Martian Fluxx is in my opinion the best of breed .	1
I love having a stripped down version of the game for the kids or new players that get intimidated with how crazy the original can get with new rules and Creepers . My kids love it and they do n't need to read the cards as much as the pictures are fairly self-explanatory . This might also make a good large expansion to throw in your original Fluxx game , though it might make some of it too easy and some of the new rules do n't wo n't make sense unless you are playing with your family .	1
When I was a child we loved Uno because back then that was the best card game out there for children . Games have come a long way since then . This is an example of that fact.Family Fluxx is a wonderful card game for elementary school aged children . I 've played it with my children ( 5 and 8 ) and with 5th grade students . My own children enjoy the game and think this is how a card game should play ( having never been really exposed to Uno ) . My students , who knew nothing other than UNO before they played this were astonished and ecstatic over it.In Fluxx games , the rules of the game and the winning conditions are constantly being modified by the players . The game starts with the default rules of draw one card and play one card . Players then start laying down cards from their hand to change those rules . It could change to draw 4 cards and play all cards , for example . There are also goal cards which show two pictures on them . These two pictures match other cards , called Keepers , which have one picture each on them . Keeper cards are placed face up in front of the player from their hand as a possible turn . Players are constantly replacing the current goal card , in addition to the rule cards , in order to attempt to make it match their Keepers . There are also action cards which let players do things like steal Keepers , trade them , or other things.There is a great deal of strategy happening in this game , mixed in with the luck aspect of drawing cards . Far more brain cells are firing in Fluxx than in UNO I 'm sure . The fifth graders like the `` Take that ! '' aspect of gameplay , of course . My own younger children like working out their plans to get the right Keepers.Family Fluxx is the easiest of the Fluxx games to learn . But I would n't attempt it with a child younger than a very bright 5 year old who is reading comfortably . It should be good for most children 7 and up.Family Fluxx is a great game for family or classrooms .	1
We played this for the first time ever this evening with our kids and everyone loved it ! Our 7 and 6 yr olds begged to play it over and over , and even my husband liked it and was eager to play it over again , more than a few times , and all were reluctant to put it away when it was time for the kids to go to bed . We plan to play tomorrow night and include our son who just turned 4 , as we realized this evening , that if he partners up with an older sibling or parent , he will likely enjoy this as well . It goes differently each game , so there 's always something new happening . Our favourite moment was after my husband had plotted and planned and strategized to try to win the game , I got a card that basically said & # 34 ; If you have the ice cream and cake on the table , you win instantly & # 34 ; and I had both on the table ! All of his planning for nothing , lol ! There was also a card that gave someone his entire hand during one game , so he had worked to gather up all the right cards , and in one fell swoop , the entire hand was taken ... we loved it ! Now , he 's wanting to play again to try to beat us , lol ... the kids were literally giggling their way through this each round , and it was truly enjoyable from start to finish ... the kids loved the way that it constantly changes rules ...	1
Account holders wife here giving this review . This game is great ! Our kids are totally hooked on it ! They play the game almost every evening . I love it also . Hubby has n't played it yet but he said it looks like fun . We 'll get him hooked ! Our kids are 8 and 9 years old and they had no trouble learning the rules and making them change with the revealing of a card ! Get this game and you wo n't regret it !	1
It has card bonuses for being a child , parent , and grandparent ... .too bad there was n't one for being a young adult , haha ! No creeper cards which makes the game easy .	1
another fluxx game . all of them are fun but slow to start . you 're just learning how to manage changing rules , which is actually part of the fun .	1
We got this game two years ago and still love to play it with friends . A great take on crossword games , and refreshing alternative to Scrabble . Since it is small , it is easy to carry around and play in airports , on holiday , or a friends house . Definitely worth checking out	1
This is a great game for game nights or just simply when you and a friend want to pass time.It is great for picnics as well.Similar to scrabble but without all the points ! Just a fast paced word game .	1
This game is super fast to learn , super easy to play , and can be fairly short . You basically draw ten tiles and try to make words using the letters you have drawn . The first person to use all of their tiles wins . You can trade in one tile but you must take three . You can also take one tile and make everyone else take one as well . This is a portable game and it is super fun.We have come up with a scoring system of sorts just to provide an added twist . If you win , you get ten points per round . If you loose you must subtract 1 point for each letter left in your hand . Of course , you can easily come up with your own scoring system . It 's just something our family does for fun.We have also come up with various twists . Banana split , in our version you can play your letters on anyone elses words that they lay down . This makes you think just a little bit more.We love this game and would buy it again.Enjoy .	1
I first played this game at a Thankgiving party with a group of people ranging from 9 years old ( my son ) to 60 's . It 's fun for everyone and challenging . It was easy to learn with the guest who brought the game explaining as we played the first time . Even my 9 year old picked it up quickly.So I purchased it for home and we 've been playing ever since.I like that you get your own tiles and work from your own build . Each person works on their own word puzzle.I 've never gotten into Scrabble , so I 'm not a wordy , but I was able to play this.This is a fast paced game that encourages vocabulary and works on spelling as well as different meanings of words . A definate conversation starter with kids who will ask if different letter placings are words.The packaging is cute in the banana that holds the tiles . A zipper is used to open and close it .	1
Bananagrams is a word game that uses letter tiles - 144 unusally finger-friendly , bakelite letter tiles . It will remind you of other letter-tile word games , many other letter-tile word games , until you actually read the rules ( which are simple enough to summarize on the 1x2-inch tag that is attached to the banana-like zippable package ) .Basically , you draw a bunch of tiles and try to assemble all of them into a crossword array . If you succeed , you draw more . That 's about it , basically-wise . The full rules are a bit more complex . Players all get the same number of letter tiles , the exact number depending on the how many are playing . They race to assemble all their letters into a crossword . As soon as one player succeeds , she calls `` peel , '' at which time every player has to take a another letter tile . And so it goes , on and on , until almost all the letter tiles are used up . Naturally , the first player to have used all her tiles shouts `` bananas '' ( if she still has the presence of mind to remember ) , and wins the game.Everything about Bananagrams is Major FUN , the quality of the tiles , the portability and storability , the adaptability and flexibility . Because the game is so simple to explain , it is also simple to change - to adapt to different skill levels , different environments and time constraints . Read , for example , Lance Hampton 's exemplary story of how he plays Bananagrams with his kids . We 're working on variations for teams , and maybe even cooperative versions.The Nathanson family , Bannanagram designers , comment : '' Obsessed by all the word games that could be found , we all hankered after something a bit more fluid than the classics we all love and wanted a game that the family could play together - ALL ages at the same time . We sought something portable , that we could take with us on our various travels and simple enough ( with no superfluous pieces or packaging ) that we could play in restaurants while waiting for our food . We love that one hand can be played in as little as five minutes , but as it 's so addictive , it 's often hard to put away ! `` If you like playing with words , it 's very likely that you 'll be taking a banana-case full of Bananagrams with you everywhere .	1
The banana seems sturdy enough , the tiles are a lovely quality , and the directions are super easy , but the fun is all in the game . My husband and I play Scrabble a lot , but it can take sooo long . This game is much faster , easier , and more fun because everyone plays at once rather than waiting - sometimes endlessly - for another player to make the `` right '' Scrabble move . Highly recommended.I did order this game from Amazon , but it took more than six weeks to arrive .	1
Bananagrams is a great game for everyone , kids & adults , who can spell and arrange words cross-word style . And it does n't matter how many different levels of readers / spellers are playing . Since you 're creating your own board , you 're competing against yourself.With it 's yellow banana-shaped carrying bag , Bananagrams stows in your purse or backpack to take along everywhere ! I love travel games that still have full-sized playing pieces.All players start with the same number of face-down letters , someone says `` split '' and players begin creating their own Scrabble-style layout with their letters . When anyone runs out of tiles , she says `` peel '' and everyone draws another tile . You can always `` dump '' a tile , but you 'll have to draw three ! When there are less tiles left than players , the game continues until someone uses all their letters and calls `` Bananas ! '' She is the winner ... unless someone challenges one of her words . The dictionary can confirm any `` rotten bananas '' and the rest of the players may a chance at the win.If you need to adjust the difficulty , you could level the playing field : limit stronger players to longer words , or give the weaker players a little extra time at the start of the game.Bananagrams is great fun for adults and kids , mixed age groups , anyone who can spell . We do keep a dictionary around to double-check those rotten bananas.We LOVE Bananagrams !	1
this is a great game ... especially if you like scrabble , upwords , or other games like that . it 's faster paced than other similar games .	1
How many times have you feigned interest in a child 's game you agreed to play with them ? This little sack of letter tiles is quite different . We 've all had so much fun playing this , it 's worth its weight in gold . I gave it to my just turned 7-year-old granddaughter for her birthday thinking it would be good 'filler ' , ho-hum but not expensive , and good for her to learn spelling . I was quite surprised that she instantly recognized it from her pre-k class and was very excited because she 'd loved it then ( when she could n't spell much of anything ) .I guess since the tiles are smooth and satisfying to hold , line up or drop in plinking rain showers , they are fun for little hands and at least help letter recognition . My granddaughter enjoys spelling real words now and her older brother attempts very bizarre words , which are always worth a laugh . The adults enjoy it like Scrabble but without the board and the elaborate scoring . In fact , we have n't even read the directions yet to see what the scoring for this might be . We 're just making words for the pleasure of it . Their mom enjoys spelling out little messages for them to see at the breakfast table and has put a few in their lunch boxes that spell a word for them to figure out . We like to lay out our names and then make anagrams . I had no idea this set would get so much use.Highly recommended for almost any age and number to play a variety of things .	1
REALLY enjoying Bananagrams ! I understand that it 's actually a & # 34 ; game & # 34 ; , but I like having it around to pass the time in the day ... waiting for water to boil or laundry to finish . It 's fun to just grab a handful of letters and put together whatever words come to mind . It 's like my own portable crossword puzzle ... no pencil required ; ) On an alternative & # 34 ; game & # 34 ; side of it ... my six-year-old daughter and I like creating a giant grid of related words . Since Bananagrams comes with TONS of usable letters , it 's easy to make a lot of words , great and small ~ perfect for a little cutie pie whose spelling vocabulary is growing : ) I have yet to play the other Bananagrams ' games as described in the instructions , but I 'll bet it 's a blast ... AND I think it would be a lot of fun for a game night with friends : )	1
Great game to play during the holidays . Games go fast with 4 or more players . Does not drag like Scrabble gets sometimes.Very portable . Good to take camping , trips , etc.Better with 4 or more players.Buy it	1
I had one of these at home for my family and had to purchase an extra set for my classroom . We love this game and it 's so much faster than Scrabble and just as educational -- if not more so -- -than Scrabble cause you can move your lettered tiles around throughout the entire round to create , recreate and build new , better , and longer words to use your tiles up so you can scream , `` BANANAS ! ! ! '' Our Scrabble game is collection dust !	1
This is a fantastic game ! It 's easy to take on the go like if you 're looking for a good game to take on vacation ( though NOT a car game , pieces will go everywhere if you try to play in the car ) . Excellent for encouraging verbal creativity . Bananagrams is very similar to scrabble but without the game board so you have more freedom to build words however you can . This is a great game for encouraging kids to expand their vocabulary and get creative .	1
I 've been playing Scrabble for years , and just got a chance to try Bananagrams for the first time a few weeks ago . I really like it ! With everyone trying to complete their own boards simultaneously , it 's a very fast-paced , energetic game . Bananagrams works well with just a couple of people or a larger group . Since each round lasts just a couple of minutes , if someone wants to get a snack or go to the bathroom or something , they can just sit out a round and nobody else has to wait.In some ways , the game is more accessible than Scrabble . A good vocabulary still helps a lot , as does a good familiarity with two-letter words , but knowledge of really esoteric long words is n't as important in Bananagrams as in Scrabble . They 're two completely different games , and I still do enjoy Scrabble , but I 'm definitely a Bananagrams fan now as well . There 's a time and a place for both .	1
My wife loves to play Scrabble , but I think it is slow and boring . This game allows us to play a similar style game , but make it much more fun and fast paced . I love having to think quickly and creatively in my word choices . Tons of fun for two or more people . We usually take less tiles than recommend to make the game a little more fun and fast paced . I look forward to being able to use this when my son gets old enough to help him practice vocabulary words for school . I know many language arts teachers who use this in their class to make vocab . more fun !	1
If you enjoy playing Scrabble you will absolutely love Bananagrams.It is a much faster paced game , which is great because you do n't have to wait for your slow opponents to make a move . You actually are punished if you go too slow , because the goal is to be the quickest.One of my favorite things about it is you do n't keep score so there is nothing stopping you from playing it on Shabbat .	1
My husband and I are hooked on Bananagrams ! While I 've always been a fan of word games , Scrabble in particular , my husband is never as excited to get out the board and play a game . Bananagrams is the perfect alternative to Scrabble as it effectively eliminates the boring sit-and-wait-your-turn piece that often seems interminable . Since we can both play simultaneously , we both stay engaged and on our toes the whole game . One negative for us is that with just 2 players , a single round can take quite awhile .	1
Simple fun game that lets the player work on his own yet has a sense of competition . Much faster than Scrabble and lets you rearrange the tiles as your letters change . They are two different games ; people are going to like one more than the other . I like Bannanagrams best .	1
I think there are enough reviews on this to describe the game 's qualities . A great game solo or with multiple players , even teams . Highly recommend this !	1
My husband and I were walking through the game aisle at the store when I pointed out Bananagrams to him . I knew from Amazon that it was a bestselling game and thought it looked fun . I ended up not buying it because I had the impression that it was just a kids version of Scrabble and did n't think my kids were old enough to understand how to play.My observant husband ended up purchasing this game for me for Christmas . We soon discovered that our assumptions about this game were way off ! The game consists of letter tiles which come inside a cloth banana . A clever and cute way to store the pieces ! I love it ! ... the banana case makes this game very portable . We bring it with us on vacation , to restaurants , camping , etc.Players start the game with 21 tiles . You must arrange your tiles into words - but they have to connect like in a crossword puzzle/scrabble . The first player to use up their tiles shouts out `` Peel '' and all players take another tile . Maybe the person who called out `` Peel '' drew an easy letter and can place it in his crossword immediately ... like drawing an S and putting it at the end of an existing word on his puzzle . Or maybe that person got a difficult letter to add on , like X , so now he has to disassemble his crossword and remake it to include a word with an X . This gives the other players a chance to catch up , and someone else may be first to call out `` Peel . '' You can continually change and rearrange your crossword as much as you want . Game continues in this manner until there are no more tiles in the draw pile . At that point the first person to use up their tiles and calls out `` Bananas ! '' wins.My husband does NOT like playing word games with me because I usually win and he ends up not having any fun . This is why Scrabble and Boggle have been collecting dust on the shelf . To my suprise , he enjoys playing Bananagrams . I think it 's because this game does not require you to be a word junkie . In fact , it 's the opposite ! It 's actually easier to win if you make short little words . Case in point - it 's a lot easier to turn the word Tap into Tape if you draw an E , or into Tarp if you draw an R , and so on . Whereas if you make a big word , you usually ca n't add or drop a letter from it . This game keeps you on your toes ! You have to be able to see opportunities to change words quickly without having to rearrange your entire crossword.My whole family plays this game - myself , husband , 8 year old , and 6 year old . My 8 year old does suprisingly well creating his own crossword , and my 6 year old just works on creating words without having to put them into a crossword . It 's easy to create your own set of rules for younger players.After watching us play , the grandparents ( who are avid crossword lovers ) were intrigued and wanted to try . They quickly caught on and had a blast playing ! A lot easier , funner , and faster to play then Scrabble . No waiting around for someone to decide what word they want to play and where they want to play it . No point tiles to worry about . A lot less stressful ! This game gets two big thumbs up from our family !	1
As others have said , a bit like Scrabble , without the board and points.I read the negative reviews and simply can not identify with their criticisms ... particularly that adults wo n't like it . My husband and I LOOOVE to play against each other and get quite competitive - glancing at each other 's words to ensure correct spelling and propriety , speeding up , reworking existing words ... In fact , we were introduced to this game by a group of older adults at a family summer camp . While the children played soccer , we sat at a table and raced to beat each other ! That said , my daughter loves the game , too , and she 's learned quite a bit in playing . We always keep two dictionaries nearby - one that is current and Webster 's 1812 - and if she has a question about a word , she asks and then uses it in a sentence . There are always opportunities to learn , for all of us ! My favorite way to play is on my own , with a timer . The possibilities are many.Highly recommended !	1
Great travel game . Helps teach how to spell and combine words and kids have fun creating their own games out of it since there are really no rules .	1
I 've played this game with 6 year olds to 80 year olds and had fun each time , more importantly , they did too . Easy to carry around and easy to play , probably the best new game I 've seen in years .	1
I played this game once and was hooked ! The rules are simple . You can modify it for kids , by , for example , not requiring their words to connect with each other . I like the speed , and in my family it 's very social . True , during the game itself , you do n't talk all that much -- only groans of pain when you get a bad letter or get stuck and have to `` Dump '' or wait for someone else to `` Peel . '' Then there 's the aftermath , where we critique each other 's boards , make charges of cheating or bogus words , call each other `` Rotten Bananas , '' etc. -- all in great fun with lots of laughter . Scrabble can be SOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO slow -- you could take a nap in a four person game while you await your turn . Takes about 10 minutes , max . This version of the game works for up to four people -- for more than that I 'd go for the double version . I love it !	1
This is such a fun game for all of my family- adult children and grand children . We even take it on trips to play at our motel .	1
I 've played Bananagrams with a number of different players , and ultimately , I must say that the game is fun , but there are some issues . The short advice is that if you like word games ( like Scrabble ) , you 'll probably like Bananagrams.The game itself is pretty straight forward . Each player takes a number of tiles ( somewhere between 16-20 tiles each ) , and then the game starts . You must take your tiles and start forming words in a crossword puzzle style . After someone has used all of their tiles , they yell `` Banana '' and everyone grabs an extra tile to work into their crossword puzzle . The game continues until all tiles have been taken , and the first to finish then is the winner.The problems with this game come into play when trying to mesh in with it 's audience . If someone is really good at this game , it tends to be impossible for any other player to win . If a player happens to get a good set of letters and finishes their initial set quickly , then they tend to keep yelling banana until the game ends . Likewise , when you get behind it 's very difficult to get back in the game . These problems occasionally ruin the game , but players tend to get used to this.The bright side is that bananagrams is also a pretty free form game . It can work with a number of players ( even 1 ) , could easily be played in teams , could be played as one giant crossword rather than 1 crossword per player , and with some additional thought , more alternative game types could be created ( maybe even something as simple as `` nouns only '' ) .Overall , the fast gameplay and free form nature of the game help it appeal to a wide group . Do n't expect this game to last you all night long , but it 's great as a more casual event where everyone can participate .	1
My family loves this game . It 's everything I love about Scrabble without have to worry about scores and it 's much faster-paced . The little banana carrying case is great - makes the game really portable and perfect for bringing on vacation . We 've had it for a few years now and it 's held up perfectly .	1
18 bucks seems a bit steep for a bunch of letters in a bag . This game is so easy that the rules are on a sheet of paper roughly the size of an index card . Easy to learn and lots of fun , it 's a real blast . The game can end up moving so fast , it could drive you bananas .	1
This is a new fun game for our family . My cousins ages 20-30 love to get a group of 4-8 people at a table to play a game . Fast paced and exciting . Lots of laughing .	1
Scrabble is a game our family has played for more than 50 years . It can be slow though , so recently we made up a speedier way to play it . Then when we bought this game so cleverly packaged with a theme using banana terms , it was so similar to the game we made up , that it was easy to learn and play , and it took minutes -- not hours to complete !	1
My husband and I love scrabble and are very competitive so this is a super fun game for us to play .	1
If you 're looking for a fun family game that challenges every one , try this ! It 's great for kids and adults alike -- we played it with my 25-year-old and 26-year-old sons and friend and everyone enjoyed it . It 's good for keeping your mind nimble . Love the banana storage concept . Looking forward to many more opportunities to play it . Will give it as a gift -- it 's a wonderfully fun present that is sure to please . Easy to store , too ! A perfect family game .	1
This game is great for all ages and so easy to take with you where-ever you go . It can be as fast or slow as you want it to be . My father is in his 80 's and is a Cross Word Puzzel whiz and he loves it . I have grade school grandchildren who love it as well . It 's great to take with you camping or anywhere . I have adult groups who even keep a set in the car ... just in case the chance to play Bananagrams presents itself . It even has instructions to play it solo . Bananagrams also offers a jumbo size for more players.Bananagrams JumboGreat game - great price and no better place to buy it from , yeah Amazon ! Bananagrams	1
Similar to Scrabble , Bananagrams players use letter tiles to make a series of intersecting words . But in many ways , I consider it superior to the game that inspired it . It 's fast and simple - no letter values , no score multipliers , and no waiting for your next turn . Players simultaneously build their own set of crosswords using a pile of letters drawn at the start of the game . If you do n't like the way your crosswords are turning out , simply pull apart some of the words , and start again . If you have some letters you ca n't use , throw them back in the community pile and take new ones . The key to winning is speed and agility . When one player uses up all of their letters , everyone has to take another letter from the community pile . With all these letters flying around , you 'll have to pull apart words and make new ones on the fly.Since the letters do n't have a point value , the winner of the round is the first person to use all their letters once the community pile is gone . Bananagrams is unique in that the more players you have , the faster the game goes . A two player game has long rounds with very large crosswords , while a six player game has rounds lasting about five minutes.Overall , Bananagrams is a great Scrabble substitute . In fact , everyone I 've played with actually likes this game better than Scrabble . To top it off , the high quality letter tiles come in a banana-shaped pouch , which is great for travel .	1
Love this game . It is fun and quick . The rules can be tweaked to keep it fun and interesting . I highly recommend !	1
This is a fun game the entire family can enjoy , and it & # 8217 ; s also a lot of fun for just the adults to have a good round of fun . It & # 8217 ; s not bulky and you don & # 8217 ; t need a board , and I like how you can throw the letters in the bag to take with you while traveling with the family . Sure , Scrabble has the name recognition and is very structured , but the convenience and portability of this game works well .	1
Bananagrams the game is ok , not great . I guess some people like it , but it 's not my cup of tea . What this is to me is a great set of tiles in a portable bag . I use the tiles to play another game , Snatch-It . Snatch-It is a much better game than Bananagrams , but it comes with terrible tiles . They 're harder to read , and there 's not nearly enough vowels . Buy Bananagrams , buy Snatch-It , use the Bananagrams tiles with the rules from Snatch-It .	1
My daughter got this game when she was 7 , and we 've enjoyed it off and on for the past couple of years . I would say 7 is about the youngest ... .as kids learn to spell more words correctly , this game gets easier .	1
I have nothing to add to all the exemplary praises of the other reviews , but did want to say that this game arrives in its zipped banana pouch carrier , with no bulky box or packaging . It 's the size of a fat banana , and would fit neatly into a Christmas stocking .	1
We made up some of our own rules and enjoyed playing Bananagrams more then . The first one to use up all their first 21 tiles is the winner.The game is way too long otherwise .	1
So far our family prefers this new game to Scrabble - each person gets to work on their own words at their own pace , you get to arrange and rearrange your letters however you want which can be just as challenging as working off of somebody elses words like you do in Scrabble.One game with just two people lasted at least 30 minutes - but it did n't seem that long , it 's easy to get very involved in concentrating on the words and letters.Overall I would recommend it - we found it to be a little more relaxing and fun than Scrabble but at the same time a good challenge .	1
Bananagrams is so versatile . We do play the game the way it 's intended to be played , but we also break them out for sight word review , leaving messages for others . Our Elf on the Shelf even gets into it before Christmas , leaving notes for the kids saying , & # 34 ; Behave Yourselves & # 34 ; and things like that . Totally love this and the bag included for storage is VERY appreciated .	1
My wife and I continuously return to Bananagrams for its originality and speed . Players are given several letters and make words out of the all the given existing letters upon which the player says , `` Peel . '' Every player receives several new letter tiles until they are likewise used up in words and the player says , `` Peel . '' The process continues until all the tiles from the draw pile are gone , when the first player to use all the letters says , `` Bananagrams '' instead of `` Peel . '' Game over.The game requires quick problem solving , a wide vocabulary , the ability to adapt , and the ability to start over if you ca n't fit in the newly acquired tiles . It 's lots of fun amongst two people or a large group of friends ; it does n't become boring ; and it is fast if you have a hankering for a quick word game ! Any family or guest-entertainer needs it !	1
Our ( middle-school through high school aged ) children and I enjoy this fun little game . We can make the game as quick or as long as we want , and everyone works independently at their own pace ( not needing to wait for anyone to take a turn ) . It 's easy to set up ( just dump out the letter tiles ) , easy to clean up ( put them back in the zippered fabric banana bag ) , and takes up very little space and easy to just throw in my bag and take with us when we want.The main object of the game ( simplified , there are variations with the same main object ) is this : Everyone gets a set number of tiles , creating crossword-style words . The first person to use all of their tiles wins . Simple , but more challenging than one might think . I secretly suspected I 'd win pretty much every game , but our children beat me several times at this game more than I would like to admit : ) It 's easy to make adjustments to make the game shorter with the included instructions . We have had a lot of fun with `` Bananagrams '' and recommend it !	1
Bananna Grams are made well . The tiles are a hard plastic and the zippered pouch makes it easy to store and/or travel with . It 's a fun game and it helps kids learn to think better and improves their spelling .	1
This game is fun for the whole family . It also teaches children new words and spelling . There is no board required and you are building off your own words . You are playing independantly and as a group . You can also play this game alone . Challenging and rewarding ! Great Game !	1
My daughter is 7 and loves this game . We play together , and she also plays herself by seeing how many words she can make from tiles she draws from the banana . It 's a great way to practice spelling .	1
Bananagrams is a brilliant game . It gets rid of some of the problems of Scrabble ( the interminable length of some games or turns ! ) by making speed an issue . You can vary how you play the game and it is fun for kids ( older for sure ) to play as well . We spent many after dinner hours this summer playing the game as a family . Even my wife who HATES HATES HATES games got hooked on this one . If you are at all interested in word games , you will be hooked on Bananagrams after your first round . So simple ! Perfect , get it ! Wish I had thought of it ...	1
I bought this hoping to encourage my 9 and 10 year olds to 1 ) enjoy games and 2 ) practice spelling . WHO KNEW we 'd all fall in love . My mom comes over every afternoon and forces us all to play ! It is quite fun and anyone can win . I love it and buy it for friends . Highly recommend this game . So much easier and carefree than keeping score and strategy in Scrabble .	1
I purchased this game because I 'm not a huge fan of scrabble but enjoy word games . I was pleased to see how fun it can be as well as the variety of games you can play with it . The base game involves a lot of chaos and interaction between the players and is a riotous , good time . The game-type that I enjoy the most is detailed in the rules as , & # 34 ; Banana Smoothie & # 34 ; and is much more relaxed and easy-going . ( The base game involves picking up new tiles and yelling out , & # 34 ; PEEL & # 34 ; when you need to grab more tiles and every other player will follow suit thereby increasing the amount of letters in their collection ... in Banana Smoothie you evenly divide up the tiles at the beginning of the game and the first player to finish wins . ) Anyway , great game and a nice learning tool for kids I would imagine .	1
My husband hates bananas , so I got this game for him becuase it would be a funny moment on Christmas , and also , he loves scrabble . The banana seems very durable and nicely made . I love it !	1
This game can be compared to a live crossword puzzle without the clues . It is also similar to Scrabble , but much much better and more fun ! The games do not take very long because the first one finished wins ! No complicated scoring or turn sequence . The letter tiles are built to last , and the banana bag is durable enough to hold the tiles for the life of the game . A great game to exercise the brain !	1
This game take the competitiveness out of scrabble . There is no board and no points values on the letters . Just plain tiles in a banana-shaped bag . Great for kids , easy to travel with . Educational and fun.Use the letter tiles to work with kinesthetic learners when visual and auditory methods alone do n't work .	1
A friend brought Bananagrams to a retreat . Fun and easy to learn , this game was a hit and I knew I had to purchase it for my own family.We play at least one game of Banagrams almost every evening . Sometimes just my husband and I play . Other times our elementary-aged kids join us . A single game takes 15-20 minutes , perfect before bedtimes.What we really like about this game:1 . Very portable.2 . No board needed , just a flat surface3 . You can change up the words you spelled , so you are rarely really stuck.4 . Takes only 15-20 minutes to play a game.5 . Playing involves spelling , strategy , and quick thinking.6 . Rules are simple to learn .	1
Bananagrams is one of those games that 's fun for kids , adults , grandparents , uncles , aunts , and cousins . It 's a fantastic game that spans the concept of a `` recommended age '' and provides not only an awesome fun time , but also can help develop spelling and word skills.Bananagrams is portable and durable , the entire game fits into a cloth `` banana '' that 's only about 6-9 inches long . You do n't even need a pencil and paper to keep score - all that you need is a free surface . The game works well with almost any number of players , young and old . It 's just as much fun one-on-one as it is with a group of six or seven . You can even play by yourself if you want ! The final thing I want to mention about Bananagrams is that every player is involved with the game at all times . There 's no 'taking turns ' , and no down time . You 're always playing , and trying to make words . It 's a great game for restless kids who ca n't handle a game like Scrabble where you have to sit and wait for everyone else to make their words .	1
Fun game for all ages . Portable . No board needed . Make up your own space where you want to play it and your own way of playing it . Great for school age kids to show off how smart they are , too .	1
Bananagrams is a competitive and challenging crossword game . It 's a great party game because while there is a race to finish using all the tiles in crossword formation , each player works alone , so it requires quick thinking and concentration . You can take apart your crossword and start over at any time to fit the tiles . The Banagrams website explains the rules thusly : '' Place all 144 tiles face down in the center of the table . These tiles are called the BUNCH.Everyone then takes tiles from the bunch and puts them in front of them , face-down . The number of tiles you take depends on the number of people playing:2-4 People : each player takes 21 letters.5-6 People : each player takes 15 letters.7 People : each player takes 11 letters.Once everyone 's ready , any player can start the game by saying `` SPLIT ! '' Everybody then turns their tiles face up and starts forming their own crossword collections of intersecting and connecting words.IMPORTANT : Words can be horizontal or vertical , going from left to right or top to bottom . Players can rearrange their own words as often as they want . There are no turns in Bananagrams , everyone works on their own crossword independently of each other . It 's a race to the finish ! ! ! When a player successfully uses all their letters in a crossword , he or she says `` PEEL ! '' and takes a tile from the bunch . When this happens , everybody has to take a tile and add it to their collection of letters.At any time ( and as often as they like ) , a player can return a troublesome letter back to the bunch ( face-down , of course ) . The catch is that they must take three letters in return . The player declares this by saying `` DUMP ! '' . This does n't affect any of the other players.Play continues until there are fewer tiles in the bunch than there are players . At that point , the first player with no remaining letters shouts `` BANANAS ! '' and is the winner ! But it 's not home free for the winner yet ! The other players now inspect his or her hand for misspelled or incorrect words . ( You ca n't use proper nouns like names , and we recommend using a print or online dictionary to keep things fair ) .If the words are acceptable , than that player is the WINNER.If any word is unacceptable , that player becomes the `` ROTTEN BANANA '' and is out of that hand . He or she returns all their letters face down to the bunch and the game resumes for the remaining players . `` The variation that we have played at parties and at home is : Everyone takes 7 tiles to start.Whenever one player is finished , he/she shouts , `` Go ! '' and everyone takes another tile . It repeats until the tiles remaining are fewer than the number of players at the table.It 's a fast-paced game and supremely fun for anyone who likes Scrabble or crosswords . There is only one Q and a couple of Zs . We allow proper nouns for those letters in our game -- -otherwise they end up in words like `` qi , '' a real word allowed by Words with Friends , meaning `` energy . '' The less players quibble about whether these kind of words are `` allowed , '' the more fun they will have . There are no points to keep as in Scrabble . You just try to go as fast as possible to use up all tiles.The tiles are plastic but are heavy and are lasting . They sit flat on most flat surfaces , including our tablecloth . The cloth bag is thin but has held up well for us . We pack the game on travel trips . It requires a large surface for play ( not for airplanes ) . It is enjoyable for most kids ages 9 and up .	1
Let me give you a new family ritual before I even begin my review : Whenever someone in my family mentions Bananagrams , we all sing a little song to the tune of Menomena by the Muppets . It goes , `` Dut dada dat ... Bananagrams ! Dut dada dat . `` Now for the review . The basic premise of Bananagrams is that lettered tiles are distributed among the players , and everyone competes to use all the letters in the bag to build real words that are connected to each other like a crossword . Whoever finishes first wins . I 'm in my 30s , but when my siblings , parents , and I get together we play Bananagrams and have a blast . The game is simple but so much fun and fast paced . It 's good for your brain , vocabulary , and concentration skills.If you like crossword puzzles or Scrabble , and if you have some friends or family who share your interests , you 'll love Bananagrams .	1
Cute game , great for kids too young to play scrabble and you do n't have to keep score . It is fun and easy to carry .	1
Our kids enjoy this game . It is perfect for travel , too ! People who enjoy spelling , would enjoy Banagrams . This is a great game for the classroom , too ! A great way to practice spelling in a fun way !	1
You can play by the rules , or make up your own . Who cares ? Anything that gets a 10 year old boy interested in making words by looking at a bunch of letter tiles is number on with me ! Great fun and great for building word , spelling and reading skills ! Kid testes , mom approved !	1
This game has taken our family by storm . Everybody enjoys it - from 7 to 70 . It is not , however , a game that lends itself to conversation - way too intense and fast-moving . We now have a number of them , and play tournament-style when the number of participants permits .	1
This is really a fun and educational game . Just a couple minutes into playing I knew it was going to be good . I just brought three more games for my mother and sisters !	1
This game was given to our family as a gift and my husband hates games . He was not excited and now he loves it . We 've played every night . It is a confidence builder for kids and fun for adults . It 's fast and competitive , and easy to learn ( except for the crazy terms which makes it funny when you ca n't remember the right term ) . Even our teenager loves it . Highly recommended .	1
For the first time in the 10 Days series , you can link travel tiles ! Th is truly the most unique element in this new addition to the 10 Days series . I 've had trips where I have 3-4 ocean liners all linked together before I even touch land again . I like that . I have also learned a lot about geography in central and south America . Very fun and a nice new way to learn geography of the western hemisphere . Something severely lacking in students knowledge base today .	1
This is a game that our family has played many times . I can honestly say I have learned more about other countries from this game than anything else . You and the other players will find countries ; I bet you did not even know existed . 10 Days in the Americas is great for the kids who are studying the American countries in school and crave more knowledge . It also has tremendous replay value , which is what I look for when I purchase a new game.There are four other games in the 10 Days line . They are Europe , Africa , USA , and Asia . All make a great learning adventure for the young and old .	1
All of the `` 10 Days '' games are fun , and 10 Days in the Americas is no exception . A new area to explore ( North , Central & South America and the Caribbean ) and a new twist ( `` cruises '' , in which you can string together sequences of oceans ) make this a great addition to the series .	1
We like this game but I do not like the way they put the Caribbean in the big circle at the bottom left corner of the game . It makes it so hard for the kids to get the feel where these islands actually are . Also the cruises are great but can be difficult to take trying to get around South America . Wish it had more cards .	1
very cool and fun for the kids to read about and explore . My 4 year old loves to ask for the brain haha ! This will com in very handy when they will be testing on it in school .	1
The human body is a curious subject to learn . So complicated , yet delicate , yet strong . While I hardly know anything about it other than the basics I 've learned up until high school , I still have a slight fascination in how it works . Now I know I may be a bit too old to care about these sorts of things , but hey , I 'm still curious ! Well thanks to Project Play Smart I was able to get a Smart Lab Squichy You Explore it Human Body ! I love their site and how easily it is set up to search for what you want . Everything they sell is on an educational level and sorted into age appropriate groups . After placing my order for the Human Body , it was shipped and arrived quickly and all in tact . No beat up boxes here ! As far as the product itself : With this hands-on kit and tour guide , kids enter the twisted world of the human body ! Complete with removable squishy vital organs as well as representative skeletal , vascular and muscular systems , you can explore the complex inner workings of the human body and literally see how they all go together ! It comes with easy to understand instructions so you know what body part is what and where it goes . It is well made using high quality materials . It was made with the intention of it lasting a long time . Would I recommend this product and company ? Absolutely ! The customer service is great . The products are great . What I love most is the reasonable prices of such wonderful products . If you need educational tools for your children or just have your own curiosities , this site is a great place to start ! READ FULL REVIEW : [ ... ]	1
I purchased this for my 5 year old daughter for her birthday . She is fascinated by the human anatomy and plans on being a doctor . She loves taking him apart and putting him back together . My only complaint is that the scissor tweezers broke coming out of the box .	1
Bought this for my son , who was really into the human body and doctor stuff . The pieces are fun and squishy . He ended up liking the squishy body parts so much he just carried them around the house , and ended up losing a lot of pieces . the skeleton is hard to put together , and the pieces are hard to get in . It is not something my child could do on his own . If you want to keep the kit all together , you need to be willing to put it away yourself . A kid older than 9 or 10 might be able to do it themselves . It would be a good kit for teaching a science course or homeschool class .	1
My 4 yr old loves this ! We 've given it as a birthday gift and its great fun for everyone . Be careful to keep it all together so you do n't lose organs ! We keep ours in a box with lid .	1
I really like this human body model as it allows my child and I to discuss his body with a 3-D visual reference . My only negative is that they squishy nature of the internal organs make it difficult to put things back in place when the learning is done . Also , the clear plastic shell is open over the abdomen , which allows the intenstines to fall out . It is n't gross , but just a bit annoying .	1
This was a nice gift that my daughter enjoyed , plus it was very educational . My daughter still remembers the human anatomy as she often refers her remembering back to this product . Cool product ; reasonable price ...	1
My 10 year old had started asking me about internal organs and where they are in the human body , so I got him this . He thought it was the coolest thing ever , and now he knows where all those icky guts are .	1
My daughter loves this ! All of the organs are squishy and sticky which kids love..anything to making learning FUN ! ! The tweezers and pieces used to pick up organs are a little flimsy , but other than that this is great quality . It has lots of education materials with it to explain what everything does . May be a little hard for a younger child to put the body back together .	1
My three year old can now identify organs by sight . That 's pretty impressive to me . She loves taking them all out and putting them back in . The stomach and the liver are a bit tricky though	1
We have a 6 year old grandson who had a great time learning about how the body works . I found some difficulty putting the pieces in securely , but , that being said , the education you can learn about outweighs the inconvenience . We are enjoying itl .	1
My 6 year old son loves the hands on toys . He has put this together and taken it apart so many times . He still needs to be reminded to & # 34 ; go easy & # 34 ; as it will break with rough play , but if you 're willing to sit with your child and do this then it 's a great educational toy for the both of you	1
My son loves taking & # 34 ; Dave & # 34 ; apart and finding out where everything goes . Very educational and fun . I would highly recommend .	1
It threw me when my six year old asked for a body for Christmas . When he explained he wanted to know how the body works , I found this and I am beyond satisfied with this purchase . We do this often and we read the book that comes with it . The only way this could get better is if it came with a case to hold everything . He likes that the body parts are squishy and I like that he 's learning while playing . The Organ-izer is one of his favorites . He likes knowing what everything is called , and I like the book that helps with proper placement of the organs . I would buy this one again !	1
My grandson uses it for his homeschool science . It does have numerous small parts , but he has kept up with them so far . He sent me a thank you note saying how much he liked it .	1
Despite the age recommendation that this is for an 8yo , we bought it for my 5yo daughter because she loves her & # 34 ; bones book & # 34 ; and is pretty good about repeating back the right words for bones and organs . Plus the & # 34 ; squishy & # 34 ; nature of the organs makes her laugh . The pieces are a little flimsy though , and some of the bones do n't snap back into the plastic & # 34 ; body shell & # 34 ; like they should , and they fall out . Overall it 's a good learning tool and she loves it .	1
Great instructional book and human body model . It is smaller than I thought . Other reviews warn that the parts of the body will get scattered about the house if you let young child play unsupervised . Well , my science savvy 4 year old grandson and 6 year old granddaughter started out exploring the parts and were able to put the body back together themselves . However , after a while , they created some other games and now , about half the parts are unaccounted for -- I think their dog ate some . So parents , this is great for older children , it is a great tool to learn about the body , and great for younger ones with supervision . Has anyone seen a spleen ?	1
this toy is super cute , but if you kid does n't know how to read it might be a bit boring for them to do alone . Mine was 6 when we got it and he played with it just a few times , but now that he 's older i am hoping he will be more interested in it ! very cute body with squishy organs , really cute concept . plastic outer body that holds it all in could snap in place a bit better .	1
Cool toy , cheep materials used foceps useless organs are squishy . Good for intro to human body but not very detailed .	1
This is the first time I purchase a doll that has its guts hanging out . I totally loved it . It is a great way that I am exposing my children to the human body . The inside parts do feel gooey . My 7 year old was weary of touching them at first . We had so much fun talking about the body parts . Next stop Museum of Science and Industry . They have a whole exhibit on animals and you can see the muscle and bone .	1
My 8 year old grandson , who is learning disable , loves this Squishy Human Body . He is learning the body parts . It is really durable.Of course , it stays in the box when he is not using it . It is not for the toy box .	1
If you are looking for toys that are educational than look no further . My 10 year old girl loves this . She has learned so much about the body and organs by playing with this item . Great toy	1
My son totally loved this set , he put it together and took it apart so many times it is n't funny . I would have helped him , but I dislike touching the ikky guts .	1
My daughter received this for her 5th birthday & could n't wait to crack it open . The 'squishy ' organs had significantly more detail than I expected , and the forceps & tweezers to remove them with made her feel `` like a real doctor '' as she said . There are also a bunch of removable bones & muscles . Combine this with a mat to place everything on to keep it organized & labeled , a nice book explaining what you are removing and how it helps the body , and detailed instructions on how to easily replace everything made this a winner for me to . My daughter is already asking when we can do it again . Highly recommend .	1
I got this for my girls . We homeschool , and at least two of them will be studying parts of the body this second semester . What a great tool ! ! Ca n't wait to dive into it with them !	1
I 'm surprised by how much my 8 year old likes this educational toy . He even brought it with him to a `` show and tell '' at one of our home school groups . All the kids seemed to love getting their hands on the squishy organs.This kit comes with a clear plastic body into which a skeleton snaps into place . The skeleton is probably the most delicate part of the model . It is held in place by little protruding pieces of plastic that snap into holes in the clear `` skin '' . I would suggest you take the hard pieces in and out a few times to loosen things up before the kids do that part on their own . One of the little nubs broke off of ours right away , but luckily it was n't the only one on that piece so it still stays in place.The organs are made up of a similar material to theseSticky Hands , so expect them to be squishy and to pick up dirt easily . However , they do wash up well with soap and water . The squeezablity of the organs seems to be the biggest draw to the toy among the kids . It really gets them interested and asking questions about the human body.The book that is included with the kit takes the kids step by step through the `` dissection '' process . Using the kit 's forceps and tweezers the kids are expected to take apart the body and place the organs on the enclosed chart . The book shows a snapshot of each step and then goes on to describe the function of each part . The book is written for the kids to read themselves . It has brightly colored pictures and lots of labels that relate to things kids know about . A phonetic pronunciation follows the more complex terms such as alveoli ( al-VEE-o-lie ) . It also includes a few `` gross alerts '' about scabs and zits.The end of the book has instructions ( with illustrations ) for putting the body back together . If I were to do it over again , I would save the piece of plastic film that originally held the organs in place so that I could put it back on in the end . The model comes with a stand to display the body , but in the upright position the organs do have a tendency to start oozing out of the open abdominal area . For now we tucked a piece of plastic wrap over the body before we snapped the front part of the `` skin '' back in place .	1
Awesome gift for any future doctor ! My son loves playing with this , he thinks it is cool to be able to remove all the organs and put them back again !	1
I chose to rate Smart Lab Squishy You Explore it Human Body 4 stars because it is a fun and educational toy . This is a type of toy to complete together with your young child and undirected with older children.Cons , the forceps & tweezers are cheap . The forceps broke right out of the body and expected these materials to be better since we paid more ( $ 24 with shipping ) than the current price on Amazon of $ 17 . Also the texture is squishy but very sticky , if you drop it on the carpet everything gets stuck on it , especially if you have pets.Overall , a fun and educational toy that will be used many times over to teach inside the human body . I would like some of the books pictured on the box to be included with the set instead of having to purchase them separately .	1
This product comes with lots of fun , realistic looking body parts . My only issues with it is that there is no storage case for the body parts and the entire body is difficult to put back together . It does n't stand up in the stand provided and bursts apart easily . But on the upside , my son has had this for more than a year and he still plays with it even if his focus is on the body parts and not putting together the entire thing !	1
Great game for the whole Family .	1
My daughter ( 5 ) My husband and I all love this game.My daughter asks us to play this game all the time . We brought it to a family party after Christmas and all the kids 5-12 loved playing it .	1
This is the one family game we can all play and works even with language barriers ( my in-laws do n't speak English ) and my kids can play with their grandparents and everyone has fun . My daughter first started playing this with us at age 3 - and sometimes she wins ! This is truly the best game in the world and I give it as my preferred gift to friends with kids . Great price and wonderful convenience having it on Amazon !	1
What a great strategy game that will help teach younger kids matching skills ( as well as colors and shapes ) and will also prove to be challenging enough for adults to play without the kids . It & # 8217 ; s just an all-around fun game that reminds me of scrabble with shapes and a pinch of Sudoku . The idea is to build off of the other players tiles , building rows of colors and shapes with no overlapping in order to rack up points and create qwirkles ( complete rows of either one specific shape , all six colors , or all shapes , one color ) . The game becomes tricky when other players block off possible qwirkles , and new rows start spurring off left and right . It & # 8217 ; s the perfect balance of ease and challenge , and a great game for everyone in your house !	1
Received this game yesterday and played it last night at our ladies ( all over 30 ) game night , everyone loved it ! In fact one of the ladies called after she got home to ask me to order her one . Ca n't wait to play it with my family , I think my children will like it as well.The game is a combo of luck ( what tiles you pick from the bag ) and strategy but mostly strategy . It 's all how you play your tiles as to how many points you get so one has to think a bit which is a good thing.I think this is a game we 'll come back to time and again . If you are questioning as to whether or not to buy it go ahead you 'll not be sorry .	1
Our family with 3 boys ( 11 , 9 ,6 ) likes this game but the 6 year old usually is done before the game is actually over : ) It can take a while to play . The scoring is also fairly complex , despite the easy concept . I still like it and recommend it to families , just be aware of the length .	1
I bought this for my 6 year old . It 's a game that is actually fun to play with your kids . He is still trying to understand all the rules for play , but that 's part of the fun . I think we will really like it when he can understand it .	1
Simple game once you learn the rules and play for 5-10 minutes . Each tile has one of six shapes , in one of six colors , five tiles in their hand . Each turn players can place ( or trade in ) their tiles . If you place , you must place tiles so that you form a row of either : ( 1 ) same color tiles , with no shape repeating ( meaning the maximum row size is six ) ; ( 2 ) same shape tiles , with no color repeating . You get 1 point for the length of the row formed . For example , if you add two tiles to a row that was 3 tiles placed by another player , you would get 5 points . As long as you place tiles in a straight line and obey the above rules , you can form more than 1 row , and get points for all . For example , if you add a tile to the end of a row of 3 , you get 4 points for that , and if you place a tile below the 4th tile in that row ( the one you added ) you get another 2 points for that new 2 you created . In other words , the scoring works like scrabble , in that as long as you place your tiles in a row , you can form more than one scoring line -- more than 1 `` word '' in scrabble terms . If you form a color row with all six shapes , or a shape row with all six colors , you get 12 points , not 6 - that is called a `` quirkle . `` Sounds complicated but its not . As long as an adult is keeping score , kids as young as 5 ( maybe even 4 ) can pick this up . In my house , my kids being 6 & 9 , we find it most fun to play 2 v 2 , with everyone having their own hand , with team members seeing their teammates hand and jointly planning strategy . While this is mostly because the 6 year old would not be competetive on his own -- and he hasnt learned to like games he always loses -- team play actually does add to the level of strategy . My six year old can sometimes spot plays that I miss.There is easily enough strategy that a strategic minded adult would almost always beat a non-strategically minded adult , and that adults will always beat kids in solo play , but team play with teams of adult + kid fixes this problem . While it may not be strategically deep enough for the very serious strategy gamer , its a total winner for everyone else .	1
Qwirkle is a very simple , yet very fun game ! Kind of like a cross between matching and dominoes . What I really like is that you can play it with almost any number of players , and even relatively young children ( such as my six-year-old ) can play competitively .	1
We have really loved and enjoyed this game ! Sometimes we play it with children and sometimes we play it with just the adults . Easy to learn and understand . Allows for conversation while playing but just enough strategy involved to make it fun as well .	1
I purchased this game to play with my children ages 4 and 7.They both enjoy it and so do I , which I think says a lot.This is a great game for kids and adults and I think it would be good for the grandparents too.Our blocks are nicely made and have a nice finish to them.My only complaint would be that I 'd like there to be more blocks so the game would last longer .	1
We got one of these games on the recommendations on Amazon . We were not disappointed , it is fun , quick to learn , and can be played with children as well as adults . I tried it on all of them from grand kids to married and college kids and my husband and I alone . It was fun in every instance . We then bought 13 games for Christmas presents for friends and families confident that it would be an addition to good times together . Recommend it as well as Spot It , both new games we tried this year .	1
I love this game ! It requires a lot of thinking and logic . My 7 year old daughter needs help sometimes but it is a lot of fun ! The pieces are great quality and will last many years .	1
The game itself is made up of a number of sturdy black plastic squares with different colors and shapes on the top . Game play is similar to Scrabble , but without the added difficulty of having to think up real words . Basically you create new rows or columns with the same shape or color , and keep score with the number of squares placed . It 's a fast moving game , so it 's great for those times when you want to have a family moment , without adding the stress of a lot of thought.I do n't want to sound like I 'm dissing Scrabble , I love that game too . I guess you could just say this is a kinder , simpler version ( which may be better for younger kids ) .	1
I was very impressed with this game ! The tiles are made of wood and are smooth and feel nice to touch . I gave the game to my grand daughter who was turning 5 . She caught on to it immediately , and she seemed to enjoy it .	1
We play this alot	1
I love this game so I purchased it for my grandson for Christmas . I have n't had the chance to play the game with him yet so I do n't know if it was a good fit for him . I think as the newness of his other gifts wears off , he 'll turn to this game .	1
Both my 9- and 5-year old can play this , which is a rarity . Would have given 5 stars , but the time between turns can be exasperating . The game packs into its own pouch , which is an added portability benefit .	1
My six-year-old daughter and I have played this game a few times since receiving it . It is **Fun **Challenging **A great way to spend time together **Easier yet more challenging than Scrabble ! As a Scrabble lover , I understand that it can be frustrating for younger cutie pies to keep up without getting frustrated ( with Scrabble ) . This game has a similar premise : creating a grid by building or adding onto rows - in this game : of color or shape . Starting a new row or finding a way finish an existing row of shapes or color ( & # 34 ; Qwirkle ! & # 34 ; ) really makes you use your thinker BUT it 's very fun so the mental challenge is greatly rewarded with lots of smiles and high-fives : ) We have yet to use the scoring system ... We just like the challenge of tile arranging !	1
I am a certified Scrabble Club Director and I think that this game does what Scrabble is so good at doing without the need to know words . At it 's core Scrabble is a game of logic and pattern recognition and those are the two crucial elements of Qwirkle . In this game you maximize your points by scoring a row of 6 same shapes of different colors or 6 different shapes of the same color . I play this game with my nephews who love it . The playing pieces are sturdy wooden blocks so the game will stand up to a lot and it is very easy to learn and to teach .	1
I gave this as a gift to some cousins . They are 6 and 8 . They immediately opened it and we all got engaged in this game quickly !	1
I love the puzzle like logical quality of color and shape-matching . In a way this is like the game of Set in that concept . However , the continuous counting and color recognition while gaining points is especially stimulating !	1
We purchased this for my in-laws for Christmas this year and played with my father-in-law , step-mother-in-law , brother-in-law ( 11 ) , and sister-in-law ( 13 ) . Everyone LOVED it . The game was quick to pick up and start playing as the rules are not too complicated . As we played more it remained challenging as we all started to develop more strategy . Played with 6 people and the games usually averaged 30 minutes - about the perfect time .	1
I got this for my daughter for Christmas . She plays it with Mom , friends , and her 2 younger brothers . It has been an instant hit .	1
Bought this for my grandchildren for Christmas . It is age appropriate for both adults and children and should provide several hours of entertainment . I like these types of sets because the have an educational value as well as being a toy . Well pleased .	1
This game has very simple rules . You can only play tiles in a single line . That line has to either be all of the same symbol , but different colors , or all different symbols of the same color . You score points based on how many tiles are in a line when you 're done playing your turn . That 's it . Trust me , it 's easier than it sounds.Once you get the basic rules down , you can participate in the game . After about 8-10 turns , the rules will become second-nature ... and that 's when the fun begins . You 'll stop thinking about & # 34 ; can I make this move ? & # 34 ; and start thinking , & # 34 ; WHY should I make this move ? & # 34 ; After your first game , you 'll begin thinking , & # 34 ; If I make this move , can I build on it later ? Can my opponents ? Should I make this now , or wait until someone else makes a play on that line ? & # 34 ; ... and so on.Just like Go or Tsuro , this is a very simple game with surprisingly deep strategy . It 's a perfect & # 34 ; gateway & # 34 ; game to get non-gamers into playing & # 34 ; real & # 34 ; games like Catan , Ticket to Ride , Carcassone , and other non-Parker Brothers games . You can then use those games to gateway them into more complicated games like Lords of Waterdeep , Pandemic , Puerto Rico , etc . Soon you 'll have generated another gaming fan , and let 's face it ... the world needs more gamers !	1
This seems so simple at first , and is easy to play regardless the age group . It is a pretty game when laid out , the colors are pleasing to the eye and the pieces are sold and well built . We sometimes just make patterns with the pieces after playing . It is a great game for kids ( ours are 7 and older ) and the adults enjoy it as well , as the play moves quickly but not hurriedly .	1
I bought several of them for m kids and as birthday gifts . All kids loved it . My daughter even took it to school for a & # 34 ; game day & # 34 ; and could not keep up with those who wanted to play with her . Highly recommended .	1
Considering that this game is for ages 6 and up , and considering that it involves color and shape matching , I really was n't expecting to enjoy it . I figured it would be a good , basic game to play with my seven-year-old daughter ( and maybe even my five-year-old ) . I was so wrong that my parents and I ended up spending the past extended holiday weekend playing by ourselves while my daughters wandered off . While it certainly can be played by younger players , there is enough subtlety and strategy to challenge even advanced adult players.I will say that the instructions are rather vague . There is only a little bit to describe how to play the game , while most of the information is conveyed through examples . It does take some mental gymnastics to apply those examples to situations in your actual game , but once you get the hang of it it 's pretty straightforward . My daughter and I initially got confused because we thought that the shapes and colors always had to stay in the same order , which seemed like it would just form one grid and that there would be extra pieces left over . Once we understood that , so long as a new line does n't touch an existing line , it does n't need to go in the same order , the game coalesced and took off ( at least for me , if not for her ) .The game is simple to play , but challenging to master , as you must always be on the lookout for how best to maximize your tiles . There is always a play available , but to get the most points , you need to look for how to play on existing lines , combine two or more lines , and especially where you can create a Qwirkle ( or even a double Qwirkle , as my mother managed once ) . At the same time , however , you should try not to create situations that your opponent ( s ) can easily capitalize on , like putting five tiles in a row , which makes it easy for an opponent to create a Qwirkle.I was expecting the game to be more like Dominoes , but it 's actually more like Scrabble without the words , if that makes any sense . Although my daughter does n't particularly like it , I think it 's a good introductory game for kids to look for patterns and connections , as well as a good game for adults who like a challenge . If playing with players of different age or skill levels , it might be helpful to play as teams.One of the best features of the game is that there is no set up . Once you have returned all the tiles to the bag after one game , you are ready to start another . The game also stores and transports easily , either with just the bag , or the bag inside the box.As far as the complaints given by most of the one- and two-star reviews , either I got lucky or the seller has corrected the problems . My box included the bag and the instructions , as well as high-quality durable tiles .	1
This is a nice game for the whole family . It works for many age groups and I think it is a nice gift .	1
We 've had our Qwirkle game for more than three years now and have played it many times . For a game that has seemingly simple rules , it requires a significant amount of strategy to play it well . Every game is different and requires a good deal of thinking . Thankfully , the explanation of the rules that comes with the game lays out the rules in an easy-to-understand , logical fashion and explains all the possible combinations clearly and in detail.There 's no setup involved . All one needs is a fairly large smooth surface to play it on ( like a dining-room table ) . The individual pieces are made of wood and appear to be nearly indestructible . It 's compact and stores easily.About the only problem is that the colors of the different pieces are hard to differentiate . Even in good light it is difficult sometimes to tell the orange and red apart and the blue and green . Other than this , this is a great game and has provided many hours of fun for our family and guests .	1
This is our new favorite game . It is fun and easy to play . I also used it as a teaching tool for our toddler to help with colors and shapes !	1
I bought this game on reading the positive reviews , must say one of the best buys I 've made . I play with the wife & kids it 's so much fun . My 6 yr old has actually beaten me a couple of times , I was really trying to win . Very easy to learn & each game is always different depending where you place the pieces . A Must buy . So much fun .	1
The day after Christmas friends came to play at our house- The kids wanted to show their friends how to play Quirkle. -- Not the new video games . Now that is a recommendation ! ! !	1
This is the first time any of our friends and family have seen this game . It intrigued me enough to buy it . So far , we 've played in one time and once we got the idea of the game , it was really fun to play . The shapes and colors are really nice and bright so we 're going to play this game in a modified fashion with our 3 grandchildren . Boys 7 and 5 and our little princess at 2 1/2 years old . They 'll be able to match shapes and colors and will have a great time with us . There wo n't be many rules for them to understand as we 'll match them to their level of understanding . Now I 've run across a new form that uses blocks which will make the game more complicated in puzzling our way to win . Will eventually get it , too , but right now this game is THE one we 'll enjoy as we teach more friends and family how to play . Great game . Just buy it , especially if you like puzzles or Dominoes . Fun for all ages regardless of what the box age states .	1
This is a very innovative game which is simple and complex at the same time . Initially it appears simple but in order to score big , excellent strategy and analysis is needed . This can be enjoyed by all ages .	1
Qwirkle is the latest winner of the Spiel des Jahres , a prestigious gaming award in Germany , and the most coveted award in the gaming industry . Quirkle is essentially an abstract game , and can best compared with Scrabble , but with colours and shapes instead of letters . If you enjoy games like Dominoes , Ingenious , Set , or Blokus , this tile-laying game will definitely appeal to you.Gameplay in Qwirkle is speedy and smooth , and the rules are very easy and quick both to teach and to learn . Despite the simple rules , Qwirkle game-play has ample room for decision making and strategy . Qwirkle does have an element of luck-of-the-draw , and thoughts about this luck element depend will depend on your own perspective : hardcore gamers might find the luck element too much , but casual gamers will find the luck element just right . For most people there 's just the right mix of skill and luck , and that 's why strongly appeals to families and is accessible to a wide range of ages.The wooden components are colourful , well produced , and good quality . The only draw-back is that the colours could pose a problem for the colour blind or in low light.The bottom line : Qwirkle is an abstract Scrabble-like game with colours and shapes that has all the essential elements - great components , quick play time , ease of learning , and just the right blend of luck and strategy - to make it the perfect choice as a gateway game or family-friendly favorite with instant appeal for people of all ages . - EndersGame @ BGG	1
We 're always on the lookout for a new game . Because of the reviews I decided to give this one a try . The reviews were right ... this is a good game for everyone . We 've played it over 10 times and still finding new ways to be strategic . We 're a family of 4 with the youngest being 12 . All of us learned it easily and quickly . At first we took it easy ( strategic-wise ) on our 12 year old but she kept beating us ! This game can be simple and quick or as strategic as scrabble depending how you want to play it . If you 're looking for something new-give it a try !	1
I am not big into playing games , but my son loves it so I specifically set out to find a game that we could play together that I could stand . I got this based on a recommendation and it is fantastic . You can play it within about 5 minutes of getting it out of the box , no complicated instructions . It is fun for younger children all the way through teens and adults ( all of which we have in our famiy and we all like playing it ) . The games only take about 20 minutes so it is n't a big time commitment either . To me it 's like a dominoes/Uno combo , but more fun and more variety of play . Very fun , excellent game , not suprised it has so many 5-star reviews .	1
This game only takes about 5-10 minutes to learn . Your strategy for play will change as others make their plays , which keeps it interesting . A great game for all ages , even if all of them do n't read very well yet.My only complaint is that the tiles are not painted as brightly as shown on the box . The yellow is more chartreuse ( yuck ) and the orange is not very bright . If your tiles are in shadow in front of you on the table , they 're not visually very acute . Our table has overhead lighting , so it 's a bit of a pain.I kind of wish they had made the paint design thicker so these were actually more tactile , as described .	1
We got this for our 7 year old daughter this past Christmas and she loves it ! In fact , we all love this game . It took her a few games to realize the strategy part of it , but now that she 's figured that out , she seriously kicks butt playing this ! She absolutely loves to yell `` Qwirkle '' and has become rather skilled at getting them ! She asks to play this game every day . Even my { almost } two year old enjoys sitting and matching the shapes and colors { with supervision of course } . We had our neighbors over one evening and they and their eight year old loved it so much they went out and bought it the next day . It 's no wonder this game has received its awards and excellent rating ... This truly is a fun and educational game for ALL ages . If your family is into playing games , other than video , I highly recommend getting Qwirkle .	1
Great fun ! This game was is a hit with the little ones and the adults ! There 's lots of strategy to be used , but the littlest toddlers can even play without that ! If you make a set of six ( by shape or color ) you get six bonus points , and you can set up your future plays with a bit of planning .	1
A group of us played this recently at an & # 34 ; end of the world & # 34 ; party a few weeks ago and found it fun but challenging . At first it seems like it might be too easy , but once you truly understand the rules , strategy becomes very important . Not sure that youngsters would understand all the nuances , but they could still play with some adult assistance . It does n't take a long time to play ( we finished three games in about an hour ) .	1
Grandchildren loved this game . It was an immediate hit with them , even though they differed in ages ... ranging from six to nine . Works as a great FAMILY game .	1
This is a great game once I got used to how to score . It is a bit luck and a whole lot strategy . It is a puzzle and a game all in one .	1
This game can be simple when played by children or those not very analytical , or it can be really challenging if you use every possible combination of & # 34 ; what works where & # 34 ; .It 's a great game for kids or for strategy minded puzzlers , which is rare.The tiles are very high quality and my only complaint is that indoor lighting can make the red/orange tiles appear the same color and the purple/blue look the same too . A pretty small complaint , all said . Much fun !	1
I knew nothing about this game until our son asked for it for Christmas - after he said he had played it in school ! ! Bought the game and even I am very entertained with it ! Good mind exercise and nice twist on a domino theme .	1
we like this game a lot and it is pretty easy for our younger kids . there is some thinking and a little bit of math and it is pretty quick to play . highly recommend for a tactile game of matching and thinking	1
Bought this game for & # 34 ; Family Night & # 34 ; at our son and daughter-in-law 's house . We have never played it , but they have told us they really enjoy playing it .	1
This game is deceptively simple . It requires critical thinking , planning and loads of concentration . It took two adults one game playing slowly and reviewing the rules to get the hang of it . It takes 30-45 mins to play depending on how many are playing . This is our favorite game that we have bought in the past five years . Highly recommend .	1
This game is kind of like playing scrabble , but with shapes and colors instead of numbers . The game consists of tiles that have 6 different shapes , and 6 different colors . Each set that is played can be a maximum of 6 tiles long , called a qwirkle . A set must either be all different shapes but the same color , or all different colors but the same shape . For example , you can have a red set that contains the circle , square , sunburst , ninja star , plus , and diamond . All red plus all 6 of the possible shapes , this would be a qwirkle . You can not repeat the same shape in the set . Example : You can not have a red circle , red square , red plus , and then another red circle . The goal of the game is to use the tiles in your hand to make a new set or add on to an existing set . You earn 1 point for each tile you play , one point for each tile in a set that you connect to , and bonus points for making a qwirkle . Most points when the tiles run out is the winner ! We have played this game with a group of adults only and it was a lot of fun . It 's a lot more laid back than a stressful game of scrabble , and the game moves along a lot quicker.I have also played what I call `` clean up qwirkle '' with my 8 and 9 year old sons . Whenever someone got a qwirkle we had to go clean house for 10 minutes . The house got a lot cleaner , and the kids really enjoyed the game . They ask to play clean up qwirkle pretty often now ! They definately needed help keeping track of the points/scoring , and also a few reminders of not placing tiles in incorrect places . But they did understand the basic concept of the game and are needing less reminders whenever we play.This game would be a great addition to any family 's collection .	1
My whole family enjoys playing this game , my 4 year old , eight year old and my husband and me . It is a great game for girls and boys alike . As other reviewers have mentioned , it can be difficult to distinguish between colors ( even if you are not color blind ) . Nevertheless , great game that can be as easy or challenging as you make it !	1
The kids ( 9 and 11 years old ) love this game and so do the parents and grandparents.. Nice quality wood game pieces , with a nice clothbag included Makes a nice gift .	1
I bought this for my nephew for a gift . He loved it . Its great to challenge the mind .	1
This is not an average mind numbing game . There is stratagy and thinking envolved , be we love it . Our 6 year old struggles getting through it , but it stretches him every time he plays .	1
We LOVE this game . 5 year old , 9 year old , 30 year old parents , 60 year old grandparents all love it and play together.Great game , it fun , educational , just really classic.highly recommended for ALL ages .	1
We just played this for the first time and we 're hooked . My 5 year-old can play , but strategy is a little beyond her . The 9 year-old completely gets it , and both my husband and I thought it was great . I love that it 's so simple and easy to pick up -- just a bunch of solid wooden tiles in a canvas bag . Kind-of like an abstract version of Scrabble . Lots of fun . As simple or as complicated as you want it to be !	1
I play this even without the kids . It is fun and brain challenging , but not hard for kids to learn .	1
I bought this game for my 4 year old for his birthday . We played it shortly after his birthday and he needed a little help when it was his turn . He got a little frustrated the first time we played because he wanted to do it all by himself . After playing this game a handful of times he needs very little help now.The game is fun for the adults in the house too . It reminds me a little of dominos because you have to match future pieces with pieces previously played . I think it is a little easier to play than dominos because there is a little less strategy involved . However , it is still a super fun game . I would recommend this game for a bright 4 year old , but be prepared to provide a little assistance . A typical 5 or 6 year old should be able to play this game with little to no help . This is a fun family game that everyone can play and enjoy !	1
Bought this for our five year old and was pleasantly surprised at how much fun it is for the whole family . So glad we got this game !	1
This is one of our favorite games because everyone can play it well . The tiles are high quality as is the bag the tiles are selected from . It is fun to play as a family from age 5 and up . You wo n't be disappointed .	1
Really like this game for our two Grandchildren . We all like to play and can enjoy it through the years .	1
Had a lot of fun playing with the kids and adults . Easy to learn and moderately challenging for most levels .	1
We love this game ! Received it for Christmas and have played it EVERY DAY since . I 'm surprised about the number of players ( 2-4 ) that the manufacturer has on the box . My whole family ( family of 9 , ranging from age 4 to 45 ) have gathered around the table to play at one time . Definitely more than 4 people can play this game . My youngest can play with a little assistance from an older child sitting next to her . Just make sure it 's the person who just played their turn , and not the person that is about to play after her . That 's just to ensure that there 's no temptation to cheat : ) If you like board games , you should get this one . Grown-ups like it just as much as kids , and many people can play , or just two . How often can you say that about a game ? The game combines thinking and luck . The 4 yr old has won a few times.Qwirkle Cube is fun also , but I like this one better . The cubes rolling around , falling off the table , etc.. got on my nerves a bit . It 's still a fun game , but if you 're looking to buy only one , get Qwirkle original . Hope this helps .	1
My 10 year old LOVES this game ! Grandma and Mom like to play too . My 6 year old can play with help . Great family game and makes the kids think .	1
The only reason I bought this game was that it was $ 6.00 at a consignment shop , I was on vacation visiting my parents with my daughter and her children , and my parents did n't have many games to choose from . We took this little gem home and started playing . Wow , what a great game this is . I have to admit , the instructions were a little hard to follow at first , so we went online and found some videos on You Tube . After watching others describe the rules and seeing the game laid along with the explanation , we began to understand how to play the game properly . The age range of those of us playing were 7 - 76 , and we all had a blast . It was too complicated for the 7 year old to play by himself , but he had fun helping me play . Once you get the rules down , it is an easy game to understand and a lot of fun . The tiles are made of wood , which adds to the durability factor when playing with the younger crowd . My mom , who is a stroke survivor , had a great time and felt the game helped her with her focus and thinking ability . She had such a good time playing that she has asked for her own Qwirkle game for Christmas . I highly recommend this game . There is enough of a challenge and strategy component to keep the most serious gamer interested , but still has enough dumb luck ( which tiles you pick from the bag ) to be fun for the younger players .	1
It is hard to find a game for kids and adults to play together , but this game is great ! It is challenging and educational for kids . I played it with a 5 year old and 8 year old and they both loved it and only needed a few reminders of the rules . It teaches patterns , and is very fun . It is really well made too , nowadays most things are so cheap but this game is wonderful . A great game to purchase for a family !	1
We got this game for our son last Christmas and he still plays with it . It 's really a lot of fun !	1
My 5 and 7 year olds love playing this game as do my husband and I . It is a fun game that you can transport and play anywhere . Keeping score can be difficult for younger kids so an older child or adult will need to help if a score is going to be kept . If no score is going to be kept and they are just playing until someone runs out first , then no adult is needed .	1
It 's rare that I can get my 12 year old and 7 year old to agree on anything to do together . This game is super fun , and allows us all to play . Recommend ! !	1
This game is so much fun and best part even the little ones can play . No big rules , no set up or anything ... just out of the box and ready to play . Fantastic concept . Colors are vibrant , I hope the paint holds on without chipping .	1
We have fun with this game -- it 's easy to learn , fun and quick to play . My 6 year old grandson can beat me . I do not agree with the reviewer who said the quality was bad . My game was in perfect condition -- maybe his was a fluke ! Buy it -- you wo n't be sorry .	1
I do n't think that my kids are following the exact rules but they still love this game ! I was secretly pleased when I also say this game at their elementary school .	1
Already a family favorite after just one weekend ! My 6 year old grand daughter kicks my butt in this game . I 've played this game with both kids and adults , and a mix of both , and we always have a great time . It 's an easy concept game so it 's quick to learn . The key is looking at all your options so you can maximize your points while trying to not setup a possible Quirkle for someone else .	1
It is a fun game . I am not sure how long it will hold up , though . The pieces chip black paint very easily .	1
Simply put , this game is for all ages . Just a delight to play , so easy to learn , but with so many twist and turns . There is usually no clear winner till the very end of the game . When the game is finally completed , with a 'surprise ' winner so many times , I am always reminded of what Yogi Berra said : & # 34 ; It aint over till the fat lady sings. & # 34 ; I usually dont get to sing , but this is still a fascinating game .	1
We bought this game on a recommendation from someone who 's only played it with more than 2 players . It 's a great game to play if you want a quick under 30 minute round . We play it quite often and we never get sick of it . Great game for all ages as well with the use of symbols and no words .	1
I can totally see why this game was endorsed by Mensa . I bought this for my 5-year old 's birthday and we just opened the box . The pieces are very nicely made , and feel high quality . It took some time teaching my son how to play the game , but he eventually picked up the basics . While it is a simple concept , there are definitely strategies that can be enacted to make this game more complicated and technical than it looks . For this reason , I believe that it would be enjoyable for a range of ages , from 5 to 100+ .	1
The first time we played this game with my 7 and 10 year old daughter they did n't like it and were easily distracted . We played it the next day and they really thought it was fun . The math from adding who was winning was easy for each girl and after everyone had a couple of turns we stopped and had the kids add up who was ahead . You definitely need an adult to explain it the first few times but after that they get the idea . I like where it takes them and would recommend it to other families .	1
Some of our friends introduced us to this game , and after playing it one time we knew we would soon be purchasing it . The game is very simple to learn and easy to play - simply matching colors or shapes . While there is some strategy to the game , there is more luck involved than anything else . One thing I especially like about this game is the wood block construction . Extremely durable ! This is not an educational game , so if that is one of your primary goals for game purchases , look elsewhere . However , if you 're just looking for a new family game that you can play at parties , at the campsite , at church youth functions , or just around the kitchen table , this is the one you 're looking for ! You will not be disappointed !	1
My daughter began playing this game at age 6 . She will now play it with anyone who offers ! It is challenging and fun for adults as well . The only downsides are that you need a fairly large , flat surface to create the tile patterns , and you need to be prepared to play for 30 minutes or more in order to finish a full game . If you bump the table and jar the tiles , it can really lead to chaos if the game is fairly far-along . Overall , however , I highly recommend it , even for adults .	1
I first tried playing with my wife to see how it worked and my son watched . I played with him yesterday and he actually did better than my wife . I think it teaches him to look at things differently and to have patients . I just wish that the tiles were a little thinner so it did not take up too much space in the bag . it would also make the box lighter . It is a good tame though . I am glad that I purchased it .	1
The whole family plays this ... from the 6 yr old who proclaimed it to be `` My Favoritest Game ... I love the little blocks '' to the elders ( but not necessarily wiser ) 66 year old.We all enjoy the `` family '' times we have ... good memories , good fun . The younger ones learn `` matching '' and the young adults learn strategy and EVERYONE has fun !	1
Fun game for the whole family . The only thing I do n't like about this game is the extensive recording of points on paper . I feel like this aspect could have been better integrated in the game itself . It 's really annoying to constantly keep track of score on a piece of paper after each person plays tiles . Otherwise a good and fun game !	1
My mother-n-law bought this for our son 's 6th birthday . It is a huge hit with my son , my 7 year old daughter , and mom and dad too . We love playing this together . We love games but this is by far the most fun ! The kids love counting up their scores especially when they get a great match . Definitely a 5 star game ! !	1
I saw this game on the cover of a magazine , and in several stores , and it was all the awards it received that got my attention . I needed a game that me and my husband could play with our kids . ( ages 6 and 14 ) . That is not an easy task to find a game for such a broad spectrum of ages . We usually stick with Uno . But this looked promising , so we picked it up . We played it wrong the first couple of times , but with each play we figured out the rules better . ( it is not one that you can just skim over the rules and `` get it '' right away . But once you do `` get it '' it is super simple . ) It kind of works like Uno crossed with the strategy of Scrabble . We love it .	1
I ca n't wait to play this game with my grandson ! I think this might keep him busy for a little while !	1
I play this with my 10 year old . It is very nice game . Game pieces are hard wood and durable . Does not need anything further . It helps kid to design a strategy , anticipate future moves , locate patterns , plan moves based on their current pieces . Overall I loved it . The game is certainly for kids in 8-12 range .	1
I bought this game for my boys , 9 and 4 . I wanted something fun that the whole family could play together ... which is sometimes difficult to find since the youngest ca n't read yet . I was n't sure if this would be too hard or not for the 4-year-old , but he seemed to catch on pretty fast and he really enjoyed it ! Now and again he would ask for help , but that did n't seem to bother him , since he actually got to play by himself and did n't have to be on anyone 's `` team '' . Anyway a couple of the other adults who played this game liked it so much they 're going to purchase it themselves . It really is fun !	1
Our family and friends enjoy playing this game with us . Our grandchildren ages 8 & 10 are so good at it they can beat their grandparents easily . A great game to play with young and old .	1
This is a game that anyone above 5 can play and enjoy . It lends itsrelf to playing alone or in teams and provodes endless hour of entertainment and good natured competition . Our children and grandchildren love to play it with us .	1
Bought this game based on other reviews , my 3 and 4 year old loved it . they may not always play the game the way it was intended , but the possibilbities are endless for matching and sorting . . . a key development for their age !	1
This is a great casual game . Simple rules , and way fun . I would recommend this game . Very similar to Rummicube .	1
Looks can be deceiving ... . this game appears to be so simple , yet it is complex & addicting ! Love it . Have had friends over & played for hours ... on more than a few occasions . I have also bought it as a gift for people . A staple game for your collection , you will not be disappointed . Different from other games , so you will not feel cheated that you bought the same game with a different `` facade '' .	1
Our 7 year old grandson wanted this game and he loves it . Perfect family game to grow into also . Not a kiddy game .	1
A friend gave my daughter one of these . There are some great videos of how to play on Youtube . We loved it so much I bought one for my sisters family and my brothers family . It 's one of those simple games that adults can enjoy as well as children .	1
My son had requested we buy family games for his 3 , 5 and 7 year olds at Christmas . I read so many reviews on games I 'd never heard of and this was one that I took a chance on . When she opened it , my almost 8 year old grand daughter exclaimed that & # 34 ; this is the game we have in our gifted class at school & # 34 ; and was so excited that I knew I 'd made the right choice .	1
We love this game . My daughter starting playing it when she was six . It is easy to learn and fun to play .	1
Unlike a lot of games I 've gotten for my daughter , Qwirkle was one I was not familiar with from having playing it as a child . Not sure if it was around back then , or if it 's just a modern version of a classic concept ( like dominoes perhaps ? ) . All I know is that I love playing it and so does my almost-six year old daughter . And the cool thing is we can each play at our own level and still play together . I do n't have to & # 34 ; dumb down & # 34 ; my playing at all . And she never has to feel like I 'm letting her win . Her moves have surprised and challenged me just as often as the other way around . Not many games like that , are there ? Highly recommend .	1
This game is pretty simple to learn . The idea is to make 'runs ' by matching colors or shapes . Scoring varies based on the tiles you place in a single play and if you are able to complete a series . My daughters enjoying playing it , especially my 8 year old . I find the game a little on the simple side for adults but it is much more enjoyable to play over Candyland and other child targeted board games . This game is a great family game . Add another game like Sequence and you have the makings for an enjoyable family game night .	1
I bought this game for my 6 year old for Christmas because of the awards I had read that it received . We opened it up Christmas evening and played for the first time . We had an age range of 6 years old to 86 years old and everyone loved this game . My 6 year old required some assistance for the first round but after that , she kicked our tales nearly every time ! I love that it requires logical thinking skills and does n't require wifi : - )	1
We love this game ! It makes mom and dad think , but even our seven year old can play . Our three year old is in charge of doling out the tiles for us , which keeps him entertained while we play .	1
This is fun and challenging for the whole family and can even compete with the video games because of the personal interactions .	1
Our family enjoys playing this game . It is easy to pick up on . I would also recommend this game for the classroom . It is perfect for rainy day recess time and for math class when studying geometry , or science when discussing characteristics . This is a great spatial and patterning game .	1
I think it 's a neat game . My kids never played with it alot . It comes with a bag to take along on trips if you want . I actually wish my kids would play it more .	1
This is one of the best `` board '' games I 've ever played . Its addicting and fun ( I 'm 25 ) . The pieces themselves are really nice and visually appealing too .	1
The first time I played the game with 2 other players , who both thought they were smarter than me and laughed at me when I asked questions on how they interpreted the rules . One of my opponents had played the game prior to our & # 34 ; match & # 34 ; on more than one occasion . It turned out , I had interpreted the rules correctly and missed many opportunities to play the way I should have been & # 34 ; allowed & # 34 ; to play , but I still beat the other two players . I would play every day if I could . Great game for mental stimulation , motor skills , strategy , etc .	1
The Qwirkle board game is fun and we play it as a family . I would recommend it as a gift .	1
This was purchased for my great grandson who likes stragity games . It is for christmas but it is something he asked for .	1
I bought it for my six year old grandson who loved it & we loved playing with him as well . A game for the entire family .	1
There are so many numbers on the page it is overwhelming to me as an adult , but it is what my daughters wanted ... so we got them for them . Santa brought them , and they are happy , and that is what counts .	1
My 7 yr old loves this book and it takes her a long time to complete the page . If I had to choose btwn this or the color by number , i would choose the extreme color by number . My child gravitates towards it more and it also takes a long time to complete a page .	1
I bought this to put in a bag of travel activities for the family to do on road trips . One puzzle took my 11 year old 30 minutes to do and 30 minutes of quiet in a packed car is a valuable thing . There are a couple pages that are too obvious as to what the end product will be and the kids bypassed those , but if they did n't know what the outcome was going to be ( although there is a key in the back of the book ) , they were very eager to commit to the 1000+ dots . I will buy another of these .	1
I got this for my son 's 5th birthday , I think -- or maybe it was for Christmas shortly thereafter . He 's quite an advanced kid but has trouble finding things . That 's why I got this -- to help him learn to search . It was a bit too much at first ( which I expected ) . But once he got the hang of searching , he loved it !	1
They were n't kidding when they said & # 34 ; extreme & # 34 ; ! My engineering husband was completely in a trance doing a page that went up well above 1,000 dots . And , our 7 year-old ( who we really bought them for ! ) thinks they 're awesome .	1
I ordered this and other books of this type for my granddaughter who is 9 years old she LOVES them , I find them a very good buy as these books are the ones `` we '' pick up to take along to the doc/dentist offices , it is easy to take and fun for the child while waiting in the waiting room.. I even have done some of the pictures myself.. You will not be disappointed when you purchase this and others in its line..	1
Another purchase for my 9 year old daughter . She likes it , I love it . I could finish the whole book for her . Warning , though , the numbers are extremely small ! I find myself bending over to bring the page closer just so I can read them .	1
too much for 8yr old . I bought this and a calmer dot to dot extreme . He really struggled with these huge ones . I made some copies and did them myself and they are involved and time consuming . takes a lot of patience . if you do n't like tedious and precise work you wo n't enjoy this . cool to look at your accomplishment in the end though !	1
This dot-to-dot is very intense but not so challenging that children lose interest . The final products are awesome and realistic .	1
My 10 year old does n't stop until all the dots are connected , he loves finding these under the Christmas tree .	1
This is a good dot to dot . As some other people have noted , some of the numbers are challenging to find- but is n't that the point ? A good way to spend some quality time with your kids .	1
I 'm sure you 're familiar with `` Scene It ? '' since there are a dozen variations of the game out , and `` Comedy Movies Deluxe '' is the latest to join the team . Gameplay for this one is n't that different from other versions of the game , so you can easily step into this one with almost no learning curve if you 've played another version before . The thing that sets this one apart is the wonderful collection of movies you 're playing with . This game borrows from movies from classics like `` Caddyshack '' to more modern hits like `` The 40 Year Old Virgin '' , `` Bowfinger '' and others . The thing that makes this though is that it does carry a `` Family '' label , meaning though it may touch a few raunchy comedies , the clips you see are nothing you 'll have to be embarrassed about . If you want to relive some hilarious moments from movies you might have missed and more you 've definitely seen , this is a wonderful way to spend an evening with the family .	1
Of course , you will not have seen all of the movies in this game , yet you may be familiar with the scene . If you knew all of the answers the game would not be fun . Along the lines of obscurity , older/black & white comedies included in the set would make the game more approriate for older players . For example , having never watched a Ben Stiller movie on purpose , I can pass on those questions.Though the rules lack logic at times with occasional clumsy game playing , the game is a fun experience . Some questions based on various scenes are quite random and require little knowledge . The big question is , `` Would it be something most people would play often ? '' It probably would spend time on a person 's shelf and be played on the holidays . Aside from certain situations , it would see little action . To play the game for maximum enjoyment , one really needs more than two players . Four players would be ideal .	1
Fun game and amazon has the best price on it which is why I purchased it from them . I would not exactly say it is an educational game but it is fun .	1
I finally got the family together for game night and insisted we play Scene It Comedy Movies . I 'd played Scene It before and had a blast . All of us had laughed till we had tears running down our faces . I expected the same here . Instead , I had a good time , but my Mother and young adult children ( early 20s ) were n't familiar with most of the movies referenced . I still recommend the game to friends but I make sure they play with people who are `` in to '' comedies from the 60s to the present . Otherwise , they will have a game that becomes boring.What did n't I like ? The music and graphics on the DVD became a bit monotonous after a while . Do n't know how that could be improved but we were ready to go right in to the challenge instead of the cute opening graphics .	1
This is your typical scene it game . It 's pretty basic - you roll two dice . One dice has just numbers on it and tells you how far to move and the other tells you what challenge you get.You can get one of the following on the Challenge die : A card challenge with 4 different color-coded questions on a card corresponding to the color on the die ; My Play which shows you a movie clip and asks you a question based on the clip ; All Play which is exactly like My Play except anyone gets a chance to chime in ; My Puzzle gives you a picture and you have to guess what 's wrong or right or put it all together , etc.Then you move your spaces according to the rules of the game . It 's pretty easy stuff - except for the questions . They are hard ! I consider myself a movie buff but I have learned since playing this game that I need to brush up on my comedies ! It makes me want to get an Action or Sci-Fi version so I can see if I actually do know my stuff ! The Comedy version has a lot of stuff from the 80s , 90s , and 2000s - probably more but I have n't experienced everything on the DVD yet . I was really surprised when we had a question referencing the movie `` Diary of a Wimpy Kid '' - mostly because that movie just recently came out no more than 4 weeks ago.All-in-all this game is a great game to play with your significant other , or with a large group . It 's also simple enough that it 's really hard to get confused on the rules . I 've played this game at least 10 times now and I have not seen a duplicate question yet ! My ONLY negative criticism would be the fact that some of the movie trivia has nothing to do with comedy . One question referenced the movie `` Jennifer 's Body '' which is a horror flick , and another referenced `` Sleepless in Seattle '' , which I 've never seen before but my wife claims is a drama . But 2 out of a couple hundred ai n't bad , so I wo n't mark it down for that !	1
Mmm , I think I 've played the more generic version with other people and enjoyed very much.This one did not seem as fun although it was comedy movies ?	1
Scene It lets you play a board game with video input . This version of the game focuses on comedy films.The game is easy to play . There 's a simple walk around the board set up in which players take turns answering questions and moving around the board . There are several different kinds of questions : you can watch film clips and answer questions about them , answer questions requiring prior knowledge , solve visual puzzles , or compete to be the first to guess from gradually presented clues.The difficulty level of the questions varies widely , from questions that require nothing but paying a bit of attention to questions requiring specialized knowledge . This might mean that many different people can play together , but it also means that there 's a very high level of luck involved . It 's also possible for a lucky or skilled player to run the board . However , we find that over time , everyone has a chance to win , and the tables can turn quickly -- sometimes a player who has been behind all through the game can win in the last minutes of play.There 's a quick play option and also a `` party '' option which simply presents questions and lets people answer without using the board at all.Overall , we found this a relaxed game , probably best for teens and adults . There 's not much strategy and we did n't notice any educational opportunities . Our most competitive players were a bit disappointed in the game , since there 's not much you can do to improve or to plan ahead . The movie clips were funny , though , and it 's easy to socialize while you play .	1
I 've played the short version of this game 3 times so far and each time we got duplicate questions . It took some getting used to using a PS3 controller to answer some of the questions , but it worked out in the end . This game is a lot of fun . They take movies from over the last few decades , so if you have young people playing they probably wo n't know some answers . I look forward to playing this again and hope we get a broader range of questions .	1
Prior to this `` Scene It '' game , the only other version I had ever played was the rather mediocre XBox 360 `` Scene It : Lights Camera Action . '' This is SO much better than that one ! This deluxe edition contains metal pieces to represent Wall*E , Buzz Lightyear , Rapunzel , and Tinkerbell . They 're sturdy and heavy and reminded me of the classic Monopoly pieces I grew up playing with . The gameboard is sturdy , and the cards are colorful and well organized to allow people to play many times with many different people before trivia questions might start repeating.The star , of course , is the DVD and the movie scenes . My wife and I enjoy the Disney movies , especially the Pixar ones , and we had a blast competing against each other . It was fun to watch snippets of the movies , especially ones we have n't seen forever , and remember just how excellent many of them are.We really only had two complaints : First , the `` Tiebreaker '' questions are pretty lame , at least from an adult 's perspective . Tiebreakers were `` solved '' by the game telling us things like the `` person with the next birthday '' won the tie . That 's not a tiebreaker , that 's just a fancy coin toss . Our second complaint was that if we had missed ANY of the Disney movies , we absolutely had no chance on some questions . I 'm not sure how popular `` Meet the Robinsons '' was in the theater , but we missed it . We ended up bumbling our way through about half a dozen trivia questions just on that one movie . A better job shuffling the deck probably would have helped , and we 'll do that next time.Overall , this game was a blast , and we plan to bring it out at the next family holiday get-together . ( In fact , I enjoyed it so much I went out and immediately bought the Star Trek Scene It also . ) Fun times with family .	1
We own several Scene It games and have enjoyed them as a family to varying degrees ; my kids ( 13 & 16 ) love them , and the adults find them amusing in brief doses . My 13 yo , in particular , wants to play long after everyone else has lost interest.If you 've never tried a Scene It - it 's a pretty straightforward board game along the lines of Trivial Pursuit ( i.e . you roll the dice and get a certain category of question ) - except that most of the questions are in the form of video clips . The rules may seem somewhat complex the first time you play , but they 're easily learned . Especially by kids.This particular Scene It incarnation is primarily about newer Disney flicks ; it 's for the younger kids ( maybe ages 5-10 would like this best ) . I agree with reviewers who state that this game is for those kids who ( through the magic of DVDs ) have watched and rewatched the newer Disney movies ad nauseum . My teenagers found it interesting once , but they do n't want to play it again ; it 's too young for them.One problem with it 's skew towards the youngsters is that it does need someone old enough to read to play along ... and older kids would likely be bored . One thing you could try , which my kids often do with other Scene It games when the rest of the family is n't up for a full game , is to just sit , without the board , and constantly play the 'my play ' or 'all play ' video clips and compete to see who can get the answer first . That 's an easy short way to enjoy the game.BOTTOM LINE : It 's exactly as advertised , another Scene It game ( so do n't buy it if you do n't like Scene Its ) , with it 's focus on Disney - particularly ( as the box would suggest ) newer Disney ( so do n't get it if you do n't have young kids ) .	1
Kids love it . Mama loves it . The music is irritating as heck , but we mute the TV in between plays . A good game for all ages and we play it all the time . Love this game !	1
if your looking for disney tv shows , then you need to get the disney channel one , all this has his child cartoon movies like the lion king , wall-e , toy story , up , ect . the gameplay isnt to complex , and theirs a pary mode that alows you to just do the video part . if youve played scene-it ? before this is the same as the others .	1
[ Update : my children have asked to play this game so many times , I 'm going to have to bump it up to 5 stars . ] I played this with my 3 year old daughter and my ( nearly ) 5 year old son . The daughter did n't get much of it , but my son enjoyed it quite a bit . I did have to let him win though ; I 've seen these movies so many times , I knew about 90 % of the answers . Still he enjoyed it quite a bit , both in regular game board mode and in casual party mode.Game play is complicated or , if you want a positive spin , diverse , with numerous mini-games within the game , and I 'm still not 100 % sure how you are supposed to play out the end game . The game board needs a flat table to remain flat ; we played it on a padded bench and it was hard keeping it level enough to keep the game pieces in play . As for the game pieces , they are lovely little pewter figurines ; although I can see an emergency room trip should I ever accidentally step on Tinker Bell 's wings . Content is rendered for standard definition TVs ; I 'd have thought that we were far enough into the 21st century for all DVDs to be designed for widescreen TVs , but apparently not.There is plenty of content , with an ample number of trivia cards , although this is not Scrabble , you are not going to get 100 full length games out of this set . Eventually , everything on the DVD will be exhausted , and this will end up at the yard sale . Still the subject matter might be the only trivia category that 4 year olds will be domain experts in .	1
I have had the original game `` Scene It ? '' for a few years ( when it first came out ) as I am a big movie and also trivia buff . The game is really great , I feel , right up there with Trivial Pursuit ( which I consider the greatest game ever invented ) .And , so , when the Vine Program offered this `` Disney Magical Moments '' version , naturally I sent for it to try out and review here . Frankly , I know of nobody who is not a big animation lover , and Disney Animation in particular , so let 's face it , this game automatically scores points just for it 's subject matter alone . A highlight for me was all the Pixar bits and clips , etc ... .I just love all the work this studio has produced for us over the past few years ! I live in a retirement property , residents need be 55 and up , or disabled . When I received this game in today 's mail , everyone present `` wanted to play '' ! I hooked everything up to our 55 '' widescreen and some of us `` dove right in '' , and now , 7 hours later , I finally packed everything up and have come home ... ..phew ! Did we have a good time ? YES , resoundingly , of course ! Everyone wanted to know `` when we were going to play again ? `` ... .which I thought was pretty darn cool as many here do not partake of activities.Some , of course , were not familiar with some of the newer characters , etc. , and were a little stumped , but everyone had a very good time , laughing , chattering , and asking `` if I had the movie for that one ? `` , etc. , which in many instances I do , as I am an avid movie buff , so not only were folks entertained with the game itself , they are inquiring to see the movie ( s ) , etc. , which is a wonderful thing here to help build community ! The construction of this game is , indeed , of very high quality , which sort of surprised me considering how `` cheaply '' things are made today . All elements are of extra-heavy cardboard/paper materials , the pieces are of heavy and durable plastic , and all packed in a very well-made box to hold everything securely.If you have children , grandchildren , or great-grandchildren I can not recommend this particular game highly enough to you ... .remember , EVERYONE LOVES DISNEY ! Even if you are a Great Big Kid , like myself , run out and pick this wonderfully entertaining , laugh-filled , `` Little Magic Box '' and get ready for more fun than you have had in a Very Very long time ... .there are many hours of fun and laughter to be had with this fabulous game . Trust me , being the big kid that I am , I KNOW ! Enjoy this fabulous game ... .it 's too good to pass up ! ~operabruin	1
We love this game and everyone can play from 3 years up . ( The box says 6 - Adult ) If you 're a movie lover this game will entertain you and your guests for at least 2 or 3 rounds each time you break it out . I 'm not sure why other reviewers do n't like magical moments compared to other Disney Scene It games , we have both and I would consider this an upgrade to the last one.It 's surprising to see how many of the Disney movies we 've watched and the little kids can play as part of a team too . We had a 3 year old and a 5 year old helping our adults on teams last weekend and it was a blast for everyone . If you 're looking for strictly adult trivia games though this is probably too juvenile.Each category has challenges and appeals to different different people like guessing characters based on clues , or identifying movies based on scenes . The most fun though was the competitions ( all plays ) to see which team could guess movie or character FIRST based on the audio clips , scenes , characters , clues , etc.. For some reason those audio clues were especially exciting.We also like that the play time was n't too long , we can complete a long game in about 35 minutes or shorten the playing board for a 15 minute game . We have also skipped the playing board altogether and just used the DVD and playing features to have a mini competition , just to see who can get the answer first.If you 're a movie lover `` Scene It '' is really fun . If you 're family likes Disney or animated movies this a `` Disney Magical Moments Scene It '' is GREAT . As a family we like this game better than the other two we have played.Recommended ***** But this is just for fun , there is n't a whole lot of education value .	1
I used to love board games as a kid , but now as an adult I find I just do n't have as much patience as I did then . But my kids love games and this one certainly looked fun . After all , we love Disney movies and have seen most of them ( and the Disney Channel is on a LOT at our house ) . But , having never played a `` Scene-It '' game before , I was expecting it to be played more on the screen than on a board with cards and dice.The rules are a bit cumbersome - definitely not simple for kids to figure out let alone parents . I 'm still not sure I understand the purpose of the Buzz cards and how you 're supposed to end the game . The `` My Play '' and `` All Play '' were confusing as well - how much does everyone move , who 's turn is it afterward , etc ? I definitely liked the expandable game board which allows for a shorter or longer game ( shorter was about the limit of my attention span ) . But I was disappointed that it only includes 4 tokens ( very nicely done in pewter , though ) since we have 4 kids in my family , and we 'd have to round up something else for the parents ( did n't games used to include pieces for lots of players ? ) .As for the DVD , we found the questions harder than we had expected . The clips and questions seemed definitely skewed toward the latest movies ( we saw lots of Cars and Meet the Robinsons ) rather than the old classics . The kids actually had the most fun when we put it on `` Party Play '' when it just shows clips and questions and everyone can just shout out answers without worrying about the board ( unfortunately , however , we could n't figure out how to exit `` Party Play '' and had to just eject the DVD ) .So , it 's a pretty good game - the kids enjoyed it far more than I did , but it was still fun for all . It 's definitely geared more towards the kids than adults , but I wonder how long it 'll take them before they 've exhausted the questions and it becomes redundant .	1
We got this for the family before our first trip to Disneyland ( we 've been to Disney World several times , but never Disneyland ) . It was a fun way to get into the spirit and see Disney hidden gems that we had missed before . Not being the biggest Disney movie fans out there , we did n't fare very well in the game , but we all had fun . This was also our first Scene-It game , but I think we 'll get the Star Trek one now , since that 's more up our alley.Another positive for a family game is that you can play this in about 30 minutes . This is n't a marathon board game that sucks all the fun out of the game over the hours ( I 'm looking at you Monopoly ! ) . Its just right for a family game .	1
I like the Scene It games pretty much . The premise is similar to a Trivial Pursuit type of experience , but with 2 changes . One , all ages can play ( with an older helper to read , use the remote , etc . ) and two , the `` questions '' sometimes involve watching a `` scene '' ( hence the name Scene It ! ! ) and answering questions about that.The kids think that the dvd part is amazing ! They love watching the scene and trying to guess what the question might be . I think it is kind of cool myself ! Still , sometimes the game gets slightly long for younger children . My family does have fun playing this game , but it is one where you do n't want to immediately play over again when it is done .	1
WE had a little trouble getting the disc to play right in our new Blu ray player.Fortunatley they had some alternative directions to start play with this issue.This is a great updated Disney Addition to the Scene it famiy.Easy to maneuver through te menu and options . Fun for all ages and genders .	1
I would say that I 'm too old for a Disney Scene It Game ( I 'm 21 ) but the truth is this is great entertainment for anybody of any age who has seen a goodly number of Disney movies ( who has n't ? ) The card questions range from easy to challenging and DVD video trivia questions come in similar levels of difficulty . I brought it out over the Christmas holiday and had the family gather around the TV and we all had a great time shouting out answers and seeing who knew Disney best . Since there was about six of us I put the DVD game on Party Mode which requires no board or remote really and just runs by itself , asking questions about sound clips , video clips , identifying characters and still images and puzzles and much more . This was a blast and by far the best way to play the game.I did try doing the actual board game though , where you roll dice and actually try to move your token to the finish line . After a while I got used to it , but even once I managed to juggle the remote and figure out what roll meant what and move the piece and keep score there was the issue of being complicated . Still , it might be a thrill for a small number of youngsters ( 4 players max ) who enjoy incorporating DVD technology with oldschool board games.A third way to play , I found , was to simply ask the card questions that require no DVD and are formatted very similarly to the questions found in the game Trivial Pursuit . With no official rules other than tally marks on who gets the most answers correct , I found this method to be the most rewarding because you can play at your own pace and throw out any repeat questions . As a fine accessory which eliminates the `` shout out '' issue , I purchasedEducational Insights Eggspertwhich allows 6 players to `` buzz in '' to answer questions so there 's no conflict over who shouted the answer first . It made the game all the better.Overall , I have positive feelings about the Disney Scene It game . Since my family is full of Disney fanatics we had a great time spotting the classics as well as the more recent Pixar and Disney movies . Unlike some of the other scene its I 've played ( 90 's , sports , general movies , etc ) I think it 's the most age friendly in that anybody will be able to answer plenty of questions and not feel dumb . For Disney fans , I 'd say it 's highly recommended .	1
As a major Twilight fan , I was very excited to receive this game , and my opponent knew I would beat him in no time . While I did indeed win , I admit that some questions really stumped me , either because I was having a `` brain freeze , '' or did not know the answer ( `` Name the Actress '' ) .I think they could have created better game pieces , but the Fate cards are fun and the questions and activities diverse . ( I particularly liked the `` bonus '' game where you answer questions to determine whether you 're a werewolf or a vampire ) . The questions were evenly spread across all three films , which was also a nice touch.This was our family 's second Scene It game -- the other being a Disney game -- and while the gameplay was exactly the same , the menus , music , and voice-over were much more mellow , subdued , and ultimately more enjoyable and relaxing . Although not introduced , I am pretty sure that the game 's narrator is supposed to be the character of Carlisle , though clearly it 's not the actor providing the voice .	1
My wife is a Twihard and absolutely loved this `` Sceneit ? '' game based on the three Twilight movies . If you do n't like the Twilight movies obviously you wo n't like this game . For the die hard and even casual Twilight fans I think you will find it a lot of fun . You do n't need to really read the books to have fun with this game in my opinion , just need to have watched the movies . Overall a lot of fun .	1
Yes , this is a product that will only appeal to Stephanie Meyer 's Twilight series . Should this be a deterrent to buying this game ? No , of course not ! There are a lot of different Scene it ? games out there geared towards different subject matters so there are plenty of options that will appeal to most . This version will be loved by all of those who love the movies and the books alike . There were plenty of options and so much to do that it could be played many times without worry of repetition . This would be fabulous for a slumber party , no doubt about it ! If you 're looking for a gift for your loved one who also happens to be a fan of the series , this will make a great one !	1
My daughter and her friends love Twilight and she was very excited when `` Scene It ? Twilight Saga Deluxe '' came out . Scene It ? games are always great fun at parties and this one is a huge hit for those who love the Twilight series ( we played and enjoyed Disney : Scene It ? DVD Board Game quite a bit as well ) , but I honestly never have any chance at winning since my daughter and her friends have seen every movie and most of them have also read the books.The set includes a game-board , DVD ( you need a TV and DVD player or PC capable of playing DVDs ) , trivia cards , `` Fate '' cards , dice , and metal game pieces.This is a very engaging game that really gets the players involved since there are so many interactive elements.Recommended for fans of Twilight ! CFH	1
Great game ! It has long and short modes both of which are excellent ! Mini games includes puzzles , questions answering and putting scenes in order ... As with all Scene-It games it does include clips of the actual movies ... Pros : FunOn Par with other titlesVery 'Twilighty ' ( lol ) Encourages everyone to let loose and just have a good timeI will say this is more geared toward the girls just like the movies but deep down everyone should get a kick out of these along with the movies !	1
This was a gift for my grandchildren . They tell me it is a good game , and their friends like it also . I can only report what they tell me , and they say it is good .	1
As the wife of a youth minister , I have gotten sucked into all sorts of teen-obsessions . I always take a group to see whatever Twilight movie is newly released . It is always fun . This game offers another way to get my girls to interact .	1
If you love Scene it and Twilight you ca n't go wrong here ! This has the first three movies combined in it with the classic scene it game style . Me and my sisters and girlfriends love it !	1
I guess it was because I told the boys that girls liked Twilight because Edward was the 'perfect ' boyfriend ... .but after that , my teen boys , 14 and 15 , started studying the Twilight movies like they were some magickal text . They swear that they HATE Twilight , but could n't wait to dive into this game when I got it.The game is hard , but it 's fun for them , and I play it too . I really liked the books , and I 'd think I 'd have an advantage , but I do n't seem to , as I never win . There 's a lot about character names . I 'm bad with names . The puzzles include putting the scenes in order . I really like those.There 's a short version and a long version . The short version takes the 3 of us an hour . It 's a well made game . Our biggest complaint is the narrator 's voice . It is supposed to be `` Carlisle '' from Twilight but it just sounds like , as my son puts it , `` Some guy sounding fake English . `` I 've had it 3 weeks now , and it 's been played 5 times . I 've no doubt when we have company it will get pulled out again . This would be GREAT for slumber parties .	1
Well , if you or someone you know is a big Twilight fan then the new Scene It ? Twilight Saga Deluxe game will probably be something you , though maybe not your friends ( depending on how much they enjoy Twilight ) will love ! Ironically , a couple of months ago I saw the original `` Twilight '' Scene It ? and though `` They should make one including all three movies ! '' Then , well , a few weeks later , there was an offer for one on Vine , and I 'm like , `` Heck yeah ! ! ! `` The only other Scene It ? I have played was the Harry Potter one released after `` Goblet of Fire '' came out , about four years ago , and I enjoyed that one a lot , though I do have to say , I made a clean sweep on that game , and although I know Twilight just as well as I know Harry Potter , I did not fare quite as well on this game as I did on that one . Still , both games were extremely fun , and the replay value is fairly good on them , though twice as many trivia cards would be nice.Set up for the game is a no brainer , everything comes as is , meaning , it needs no assembly , so in that regard its easy for kids . As for the game play , if you are familiar with Scene It ? then you know that it is a DVD based game , the game plays movie/sound clips and things like that and you have to finish lines or guess who it is , and other various interactive things , as well as being a straight up trivia game with cards and normal trivia questions which have separate question categories for each movie.I found my favorite part of the game was the straight up trivia questions or the My Play and All Play , as I am pretty good at finishing the line or guessing who said what and things like that . I did n't particularly find the puzzles all that challenging ( with the exception of the memory game , that one I failed every time at , so it was quite challenging in that way at least ) , and found myself wishing there was like a jigsaw puzzle or something . I also did n't find the `` Special '' All Play anymore challenging than the regular one , but maybe that 's not the point ? It would have been nice if the question was more challenging because I won in one guess once I made it to the end , and trust me , I did not win all the regular play alls.Not a perfect game , but it is fun , the only thing that make make it a more re-playable game is a multi-level system that has an `` easy '' , `` normal '' , or `` hard '' option ? Though , probably mixing them together is good so its more fair game play if your not playing with people of all the same play level ( in terms of Twilight movie knowledge ) . Enjoyable game and really fun to play in a group with people who share your love of Twilight ! God Bless ~Amy	1
Scene it ? Twilight Saga Deluxe is a fun game for the whole famliy . It will be more fun , however , if you have watched the movies . There were a lot of different scenes not seen before so that made it more fun . The game is very engaging and would recommend it for 10+ as well . I played this with my daughters , and do plan to get more Scene it games in the future .	1
I should point out that I am completely unfamiliar with the series , and will be relating what my wife , her cousin and her mother say about the game . I should also note that they are HUGE fans . In the week that I got the game , they have been over twice to play . As a point of reference , my mother-in-law was last here about a month ago and my wife 's cousin has n't been over in months . I wish I could say it was my charm and devilishly good looks ... ..alas , that is probably not the case . As a non-participant , I can tell you that they get very excited . Seeing some clips , the video look great , everything is clear , and it seems pretty easy to play . Of course they know everything , well , my wife 's cousin does , and she makes it look easy . My wife finds it the most challenging ... .but they love it , and it 's a great excuse for them to get together . It 's not that my wife 's cousing runs away with it , she still finds it challenging . I should also mention that my wife is not really a `` game person . '' And for her to enjoy a game so much is pretty impressive to me ... .so , if you are a fan , I think you must buy this . My wife agrees . My mother-in-law agrees . My wife 's cousin , well , her birthday is comming up , and she is very clear on what she wants ... .this !	1
This is a ca n't miss for fans of Stephenie Meyer 's vampire books and the accompanying films . It 's perfect for a birthday or holiday present for tween girls ; it 's also a great one to play for a slumber party or Twilight themed party . It 's not a great game for the whole family to play , in that there are not that many men who are Twilight groupies , but it could be very fun for a mother-daughter group . The Scene-it games can be played over and over without too much repetition , since they include a variety of puzzles , trivia games , clips , and more so you do n't get bored quickly like you do with some board games . I can really see this one as a crowd pleaser at a party , since it can be played in teams if you have a big group .	1
My daughter and her friends play this , but of course , they have seen all the movies and read all the books . I do n't think I could get an answer correct to save my life ! Lots of fun for the teenagers !	1
My friends and I are huge Twilight fans so we could not wait to play this game . I previously purchased the New Moon boardgame which was dissapointing because the questions were really easy and the game was not all that fun - so we were really hoping that Scene It would fullfil our desire for a fun Twilight Game - which it totally did ! The game plays like a typical Scene It game with both DVD questions and questions on the card . There are two dice included - one with numebers and one with pictures of the different challeges . It can also be played on half of a board - or you can expand the board for more players and depending on the amount of time that you have . The only complaint that I have about the game is the board itself - it is flimsy and did not unfold into a flat position so the game pieces would not stand up.My friends and I really enjoyed this game - the questions were challenging which made it really entertaining . It contained a ton of clips from all 3 movies . There are also bonus features on the DVD such as Party Play - which is just continuous questions with no stopping . We had so much fun with this game and ca n't wait to have our next Twilight Night . Definately pick this up if you are a fan of the series . Please note that the questions are all based on the movies and not the books .	1
This is a fun family game for Simpsons fans . It is more fun that other Scene It games I have played and was more enjoyable for the whole family . This is a good value since it 's the Deluxe version for the same price as some stores sell the regular version . Some of the trivia questions are hard , but everyone has a chance to do well since many of the questions are based only on observations from the clips that are shown . This would be a great addition to a family game night collection as well as a welcome gift for a fan of The Simpsons .	1
This is exactly what you would expect from Scene It with an all Simpsons theme . This game and a partnership with the Television show make for a nice combination . For avid fans of the Simpsons , the game is a little easy so perhaps you might make a rule that you need to have the entire name of a character ( even the obscure ones ) to get the answer right . The game on the disc looks solid and crisp and it does NOT look like something that was just thrown together . If you like the Simpsons or are huge fans , you wo n't be disappointed buying this .	1
Great game ! It was a little harder than we thought . The cards are sometimes ridiculous as in `` Who would EVER know that ? '' pretty hard to get . Otherwise it was fun and had a good time watching the scenes from Simpsons .	1
As someone whose watched this movie at least once a year for nearly 30 years , I 'm a real Rudolph fan . When I had the chance to grab a Rudolph game made by the Scene It game makers which have entertained me for so many hours , I jumped on it . This game definitely has a little kid bent to it , but for a person who can recite all the movies lines with childish delight it 's still a great game to play.My husband and I played this and an entire game only took about 15 minutes , though I 'm sure it would take longer the more people that were playing or if some players were children . You move old school cardboard character cut outs of Rudolph , Clarice , Hermie , or Santa ( no Yukon Cornelius sadly ) around the board trying to rescue misfit toys before the Bumble can swipe them . You can only collect one of each color as you need 3 toys each of a different color token to win . The youngest player rolls a die to go first and a dvd directs you as to where toys have been cited by King Moonracer or alerts you to the Bumble 's trouble making.To rescue a misfit toy you not only have to reach it before the Bumble , but you must win a mini game on the dvd . There simple games from selecting the right picture card on the screen from memory , selecting the correct toys which were flashed on the screen , or finishing a song line from the movie . Sadly , no , Burl Ives does not host this game nor were they able to find an Ives impersonator . I assume no Abominable Snow Monsters were harmed in the making of this game . A holiday blast !	1
Each holiday season the Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer stop-motion animated special holds a special place in our household -- both for our five-year-old son and his nostalgic parents.The new Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer DVD Games does a good job in turing the enduring TV classic into an interactive experience that really is fun for the whole family . Considering it comes fromScreenlife , the same folks responsible for the popular Scene It games , it 's not surprising that the hybird board game-DVD game formula works as efficiently as it does.Incorporating characters and footage from the original '60s special , the game version adds a new chapter to the Rudolph story -- a powerful storm has resulted in scattering the Misfit Toys throughout the North Pole and Santa needs help to collect them all in time for Christmas Eve . The object of the game is to race around the board and collect them all before the nasty Bumble the Abominable Snow Monster gets to them first . The first player to collect three different-colored Misfit Toys before Bumble collects any six toys , is the winner.In other words , standard board game m.o. , but where things get fun is whenever the roll of the die takes you to a Misfit Toy Token . Then you use the DVD remote to access one of the nine entertaining mini-games , which can be anything from picking which character you think will win a sled race ; to questions related to movie clips from the original special ; to Santa Sing-a-longs where you find out how well you remember the words from those catch original Rudolph tunes.Our five-year-old , who usually does n't have patience for board games , really enjoys the DVD component -- he 's at the perfect age for most of the puzzles.Aside from a couple of board/DVD menu layout quibbles mentioned in other reviews , we really enjoy playing this game -- and being able spend some quality -- as well as thought-provoking -- time with Misfit Charlie-in-the-box , Misfit Spotted Elephant and company .	1
Another great collectible item . Rudolph is a Christmas classic and it is always a good idea to collect items that not only bring a smile to your face , but it makes for a great investment . A great game at a great price .	1
My kids 10 & 13 love that this is true to the story . My grandkids ages 3,5 , & 6 also love to play along with us . If you love rudolph then this is a collector item you will want .	1
This is a pretty fun Christmas game to play . If you have played a SCENE IT game before , you 'll already know what to expect . I 'd recommend it .	1
The Rudolph the Red Nosed Reindeer DVD game was a bit tricky to understand at first but once underway it made for a great evening of family fun . My 6 year old son was excited when he saw the box and after a bit of setting up and explanation we were able to get into the game . The game essentially has you rolling dice and moving around a game board . In order to collect tokens you need to answer questions on the DVD . Most of the questions are geared for young children so there is more fun than critical thinking involved but enough difficulty to keep adults interested . The game play is approximately 30 minutes . For the price this is a great game that that young kids will really enjoy.Positive Points Include : - Easy to understand and play ( after the initial setup ) - The questions are a nice mix of easy to understand and fun- Game time is just right where it is short enough to be fun but not too long where it becomes boringNegative Points Include : - Kids need some parental assistance with the DVD and setup- Not a lot of replay value after a few sessions- DVD instructions are sometimes not in tune with what is happening on the game board	1
If you 're a fan of the classic Rankin/Bass TV special , RUDOLPH THE RED NOSED REINDEER , first of all you should have the `` making of '' book by eminent R/B specialist Rick Goldschmidt as well as the soundtrack album on CD . You 'll also enjoy this interactive DVD/board game version though you wo n't be able to impress anyone with your detailed knowledge of the longest running holiday TV special in history.However , do n't let that stop you . The folks who made SCENE IT came up with a colorful , nicely paced game that can be played by young children and adults with no one getting frustrated or bored . And the DVD is not an ancillary part of the game -- you really need it to play along.The narrator , a well-chosen , grandfatherly type who could very well have been in the original cast ( though of course he was not ) , guides you warmly through the proceedings . The story is that the Misfit Toys have scattered and the players must rescue them before Bumbles the Abominable Snowman captures them . The DVD tells you where to place the toys and Bumbles and you choose to be Rudolph , Hermie , Clarice , or Yukon Cornelius.Every time you attempt to rescue a toy , the DVD has a game for you to play , from watching a clip from the film and recalling a detail to guessing which character will win a race . Some are pure chance and others require observational skills.It may be my DVD player , but there was a bit of inconsistency in the time allowed to answer the challenges . Also , it 's not clear where to keep the Misfit Toys -- on the image in the game board or off the board -- because the narration contradicts it . When you are standing on a space that the DVD suddenly assigns a toy , do you get to rescue it on your next turn or do you have to leave the space and return later ? We decided that since there is no minimum number of spaces to move regardless of the roll of the die , you could stay there and help the toy.The overall design of the game board is lovely and the DVD cleverly manipulates images and audio from the film for various purposes . My only quibble is that there should have been credit given to Arthur Rankin , Jr. and Jules Bass , since the classic film is their landmark production . I do n't care whether it was determined by marketing people that it does n't matter -- it does , to more people that you think . It might have been nice to offer special thanks to the voice cast and also Anthony Peters , whose art direction graces all of the Rudolph merchandise . Just a nod would be an act of courtesy and respect to great artistry and talent.My son loves the game by the way and wants to make it a holiday tradition .	1
My kids ( ages 3 and 5 ) love the Rudolph DVD Game . It works in much of the same way as a regular Scene It Game but it is simplified so that even my 3 year old can get the answers right . My kid 's have watched Rudolph a few times but you do n't need to know the movie to play this game ( although it makes it fun to know the character 's names ) . We did not play with the game board because I found it too confusing for younger children . We just played with the DVD and did not keep score . The DVD would show a scene and then ask a question related to the scene . An adult really needs to supervise for younger children who are n't familiar with the DVD remote control . My kid 's really enjoyed it . The only problem I had was with the game board which was divided into 4 sections - my kid 's could n't really get the concept of it and I found it a little difficult to understand myself . Overall , a fun game .	1
This game is definitely for the kids . When we played along with the kids , we did n't think the game was all that great , but the kids absolutely loved it . They were really excited to play it , and got really into the game especially when `` Bumble '' was on the move. -- Fun for all Ages ? -- We played it with a 3 1/2 year-old and a 6 year-old . They both loved it . And have played it many times . We have to play a long because they do n't know how to operate the remote to the DVD player correctly.Some kid games are lots of fun for adults to play as well ; that 's not quite the case with this game . A few of the very repetitive phrases are irritating once you 've played it for a while. -- Technical Problems with the Game -- There were also some quirks in the game . Once we tried to select the Reindeer Games item on the screen and it just would n't work ! Another time , the game got stuck and we could n't do anything and had to start over . We 've had the problems on two different DVD players.Once we selected the right answer from the screen and it said we got it wrong . It also counted incorrectly the number of toys that Bumble had collected.Those problems were pretty frustrating. -- Overall Assessment -- Overall , the game is for kids , and since the kids love it , that 's a pretty good sign for the game . I wish as we as adults played along that it were a little more fun and that the technical problems were n't there , but again , it 's a game for kids , and they like it a lot .	1
Rather than stealing Rudolph 's family , in this game , Bumble decides to steal the misfit toys . It 's up to players to rescue the toys before Bumble gets six of them . Going around the physical game board , when a player lands on a toy in one of four different sections , s/he gets to play one of nine different mini games on the included DVD , randomly chosen . If successful , that player wins one of the misfit toy tokens ( needing to eventually win three out of four different colors ) . The games are a mix of extremely easy to slightly challenging . This helps add to the ability for children through adults to play . One ( Sled Race ) requires a guess , so that all ages have an equal chance to win it . However , anyone who has watched the film many times will find four of the games easier to play than those who have n't , and adults will generally have an advantage over younger players . The games include identifying the voice of a main character , making a correct match ( a memory game ) , and guessing which box Charlie is in after it has been shuffled about . The mini games are entertaining enough that it would be nice to be able to access them alone on the DVD , without having to play the board game , or be able to choose which ones to play -- but you can't.As players proceed around the meandering board in any direction , the DVD keeps track of Bumble 's whereabouts . Once he 's in a specific one of the four regions , he 's going to eventually steal a toy from it . The DVD keeps track of Bumble 's toy robberies , but even if Bumble wins the game , the DVD shows a clip from the movie that says he is reformed , so there 's no unhappy ending.Overall the game is fun , but there are some things users may not like as much as others . The most obvious is that the main story has been altered , and it does n't fit in with the movie 's plot . The process of gameplay is a bit unnerving at times . For example , a player might be told to put a toy token in a specific region , only to be asked to remove it in the same turn . There is a lot of set-up and maneuvering of game tokens in between most turns . The narrator 's voice is a little irritating and his instructions and the animations can seem repetitive . The biggest drawback of the game and DVD combo , however , is that the layouts do n't coincide with one another . The layout of the DVD menu shows the regions in this order : Great North Mountains , Elf Toy Shoppe , Reindeer Games Playground , Santa 's Castle . The board shows them in this order : Santa 's Castle , Great North Mountains , Reindeer Games Playground , Elf Toy Shoppe . This makes play a bit awkward as players attempt to find the corresponding space to select on the DVD menu.Despite a few little drawbacks , the board/DVD game is still fun . We plan to play it each Christmas season .	1
One of our Family 's Favorite Holiday Traditions , besides the great get-togethers for family , food and gifts is watching many of the darling animated Christmas Shows every Christmas Season . We love them all , to name a few- A Charlie Brown Christmas , A Year Without A Santa Claus , Santa Claus Is Comin ' To Town , Jack Frost , Frosty The Snowman , Nestor The Long Eared Donkey and especially Rudolph The Red Nosed Reindeer . When I saw this new Rudolph the Red Nosed Reindeer dvd game , based on one of our favorite animated Holiday television shows- I just had to try it out ! Our family has spent many Christmas ' playing a game of Monopoly , checkers or cards later in the evening just for family fun after all the talking , eating , watching Christmas Shows and opening gifts . This Christmas game will be nice for the younger children ! This Rudolph The Red Nosed Reindeer Dvd Game is actually a board game with dvd interaction . You can play with 4 players-Rudolph , Hermey , Clarice and Santa Claus or with more people- in pairs . You are actually playing against the other opponents to collect 3 of the Misfit Toys First to win the game , but also to get 3 toys first before the Abominable Snowman Bumble finds 6 of them . You roll a die and walk around the board where the dvd tells you exactly where to scatter toys . When you land on a toy , you get to play a mini game . If you are successful in winning the mini game , you get a toy . It looks and sounds easy until you start playing the game ! Several of the adults in our household played the game to try it out and some of these mini games are quite challenging ! The 9 different mini games seem to have quite a few different ones and the categories are : Movie Clips-where you view part of the film and answer a question ; Sled Race-where you try and pick the winner of the sled race ; Concentration-match a pair after viewing several pairs of characters in a grid- reminds me of the old Memory Game ; Charlie-In-The-Box-Charlie gets shuffled and if your eyes can follow the box he 's in , you have to guess when asked ( reminds me of the old Shell Game ) ; Santa 's Sing Along- guess the words from the film 's songs ; Toy Sorting-guess which box of toys contains the most from the group on the shelf ; Present Pop-Up- Watch the toys pop out of the boxes , then see if you can answer a question about what you saw ; Bumble 's Cave-you have to guess the voice of the person who 's hiding inside the cave ; and Santa 's Memory-guess a detail from the film . The game takes about 30 to 45 minutes to complete and the dvd keeps track of Bumble 's every move and found toys . When our 4 adults had a hard time guessing the winners of the race and not being able to remember where the matches are in the Concentration Game , we knew this is a game that the entire family will enjoy.This is an absolutely darling holiday game that the children will have fun playing and I 'm going to make it even more exciting , by having little gifts filled with inexpensive little candies or items for the winners !	1
This is a great way to get inspired to write poetry and I love the words that were chosen to put on the magnets .	1
Hilarious little box of word magnets . We used these at a bachelorette party to create funny , obscene phrases and stories . It can also be fun to use with a romantic partner- maybe even as a Christmas stocking stuffer !	1
We are enjoying making sentences for each other . But when mixed company is over , these are the first to be put away , for obvious reasons . We 're having a blast with them , though . Thinking I need to order more sets to have more fun , though . Good set stands on it 's own very well .	1
Purchased these for an `` edgy '' aunt for xmas ... they were a hit ! She loves them and it is a good sized tin . I thought seriously about keeping them for myself . Now these are on my want list . Highly recommend .	1
Colorful characters , a bit of `` cut throat '' and a few silly cards can create lots of fun . Out of all the Fluxx games , Pirate Fluxx is our second favorite . Zombie Fluxx is our # 1 so far . Original Fluxx is the easiest to learn and `` kindest '' to newbies , so I 'd start with that one , regardless .	1
We have played many variations of this game and this is my favorite . Especially love suprise cards which can block other player 's actions ( or even block their block ) . COuld live withouth the & # 34 ; talk like a pirate & # 34 ; card though .	1
While I 've not personally played all version of Fluxx , the format to playing is all the same . Some minor strategy with a lot of randomized gameplay thrown in . Classic and Pirate Fluxx have been the two I 've played with my significant other and friends . Pirate Fluxx is definitely themed appropriately and is slightly humorous , but more generic than I feel it could have been.There are certain cards that cross the 4th wall , forcing you to talk like a pirate or address a player as captain which I find to be a bit too cheesy , but for younger or more casual players , that 'll be fun to do for a few times.Overall gameplay can either go quick , or drag on a long time depending on how the stack ends up . I 've played games that have burned through near the entire deck with two players which gets boring and tedious to deal with , but most games are pleasant .	1
Fast paced , constantly changing and very unpredictable . I would recommend this to both gamers and casual players alike . My family and I enjoy playing this game and it has great pace to break up some of the longer games we play .	1
If you 've ever played a turn-based multiplayer computer game , the old style games would have you waiting for the next player to take their turn before you could do anything . This was kinda of a bummer as it could be a long wait because there were so many decisions to make.That is the same here.because the rules keep changing some players are taking a while to catch up with the rule changes and then re-read their cards to know what to do next . . . .unlike card games like Dominion , where you can memorize the cards and play without paying much attention.Other than that , our family of six ( ages 9-over 40 ) really like this game.Everyone has a chance to win.It 's difficult to apply a lot of strategy because things keep changing so fast.Our games yesterday took over 1hr the first time , because kids kept goofing off and not trying to win but just wanted to play through the various cards . The next two games took less than 20 minutes each.We like that all of us can play and that we can play more than one session , when paying attention to the goal.OVERALL : If players can keep up with the rule changes and figure out what 's in their hand , it becomes a fast game you can play several times in one sit down . No single person has an advantage as you can counter the moves of others and hope your draw of the cards is the right combination . We like it a lot !	1
a good gift for a game playing friend who can be hard to buy for . This game comes in several versions , which is nice to adapt to other intersts that they have .	1
Hysterical ! Lots of fun ! Expect nothing less from the folks at Looney Labs . Great for two or more players . Highly recommend this game .	1
Fluxx is the ever changing card game . The additional elements in Pirate Fluxx make this one very different from the traditional Fluxx and different from other themed Fluxx games like Oz Fluxx . Be sure to brush up on your & # 34 ; Pirate Speak & # 34 ; for when the talk like a pirate rule goes into effect and you can enjoy being the Captain complete with the hat !	1
First off , the basic Fluxx game mechanic is a 4-star game . It 's fun , trivially easy to teach and not too frustrating for the players . But in its `` beer and pretzel '' silliness are mechanics that let it sometimes get bogged down or too weird.Pros : It 's very easy to play , even for beginners -- starting with a single `` draw one , play one '' rule.It 's silly fun with half the cards changing the rules or the goals of play.It scales well from 2 to many playersIt is somewhat replayableNormal games are about 15 minutes.Cons : It 's hard to use very much strategyIt 's HIGHLY variable in length . One game can be a 3-card laydown win . Others are an hour or more.It 's good for about 3-4 games before you 're moving on to other things.The `` Pirate Fluxx '' deck is a stand-alone game which has the same basic pros and cons , while being marginally more fun than the basic game . It contains a full deck of cards specific to Pirates , and introduces new concepts along with the new theme . A few key cards of note : The Captain 's Hat , adds bragging rights to the game and a few play variations.The `` talk like a pirate '' card is fun , though gets silly after a while.Two new creepers are interesting , easily gotten rid of , and add a bit of variation to playThe `` Plunder '' card introduces significant card swapping among players.If you 've played Fluxx before , or want a safe first time purchase , it 's worthwhile . It wo n't make the sole basis of a 4 hour game night , but is a good filler.Of the theme decks I 've played so far ( Original , Monty Python , Zombie , Pirates ) Pirates is my favorite .	1
Especially when my boyfriend and brother-in-law join me in using the talk like a pirate card for bonuses ! This version was too much fun ! I think it has been by far the best one ! I 've played family , cthulu , and eco-fluxx 's as reference .	1
This variant is easy enough to understand : Everyone is a pirate and the goals and themed New Rules will be piratey in nature . Arr ! Ye defines the game as it goes , so ye do , and there be little point in long-term strategy since the goals be a-changin faster than the wind at Cape Horn , so they do.I like this variant mostly because it allows me to talk like a pirate from the get-go and rewards me for doing so occasionally . The cards are amusing and the theme is a rich one , comedy-wise.But it is flawed in that there are only two creepers in the deck ( cards that prevent a win ) - Chains and Scurvy.Though it is fun that in this game scurvy is a communicable disease , both creepers are just too easy to be rid of and to be honest they might as well not be there . The game conceit had room for many more creepers in my opinion , so why the deck only has the two is beyond me.Despite that I recommend it to all would be pirates and most pasty-faced landlubbers too .	1
My first interaction with Fluxx was Zombie Fluxx . It was a gift from someone very dear to me . I loved it , as I loved all zombie things . Now today , I am not really able to play this game . The person I choose to spend my life with hates to their core zombies , and while I might be able to do some zombie things on my side , when I play games it 's her I play them with.Pirate Fluxx however is a nice version of Fluxx as well . ( Probably my second favorite ) .Players start with three cards in their hand . As a base rule there is no way to win the game , and players only get to draw and play down one card.Cards can be goals , ways to win the game . Items , things used to meet the goals , and therefore win the game . Rules , that can effect how the game is played , and lastly actions which can effect things in play , or player 's hands directly.In addition to the normal cards , in the deck is a limited amount of Creeper cards , when you get a creeper card , it immediately plays down and you replace the card from the deck.Creeper cards can prevent you from accomplishing a goal , and winning the game , unless a card specifically says otherwise.Play continues with rules being written , overwritten , disposed of , and goals being thrown down constantly . Game is over when players meet the goal . Which could be anywhere from 10 minutes to over an hour.WHAT DID I LIKE ABOUT THE GAME : A lot of the rules and touches to the game that are unique are well played.The rule that allows you to take additional cards , as long as you keep up your pirate accent is my favorite , followed closely by the Captain 's hat , that requires people to call you Captain.While for the most part the game is just like all other versions of Fluxx , the Pirate theme is well played , and unique enough . This is accomplished thanks to the items and their abilities , making this game worthy of being picked up even if you have one of the many other versions of Fluxx.WHAT DID I DISLIKE ABOUT THE GAME : I have to say , while the dynamic is fun , Plundering ( the ability to steal one item per turn , created by a rule ) has to be one of the most frustrating parts of the game.Also you may as well say good bye to strategy , since any player might be able to steal the last item during a 5 play turn , to win the game thanks to your plundered item.I also dislike how sometimes you can have a game that lasts less then 10 minutes.WHO IS THIS GAME DESIGNED FOR ? Pirate fans , fans of the original Fluxx , and people who have an indeterminate amount of time.RATING ! 5 out of 8 . One of the best things about this game , is also one of the reasons it takes a ding the unique facet to the structure of building yourself how you win , makes the game possibly quick and boring .	1
Many of the cards in this game will remind you of sci-fi and fantasy movies and television shows you have been watching for years . It 's fun having them combined into one crazy card game . Fluxx games are always crazy , but this version is one of the most fun for sci-fi fans . Enjoy !	1
I love the addition of keepers that have abilities . I also wish that there was a pack that integrates this version with the original . Like Cookies for the captain or other goals that use the original game and the Star Fluxx Keepers .	1
ITs like your in space , and playing with space themes . My friends and I really enjoyed play with this fluxx . I also own few other fluxx games ... all of them are fun espically when you create your own rules and mix them with other fluxxs . very cool , and longer as well but fun .	1
Wonderful game for novices and experts alike . The only real caveat is the length of play , as the victory conditions can change at the drop of a hat . Games can be as short as a few minutes to almost 2 hours ( these are the extremes I have been a part of ) , something to keep in mind .	1
This was a gift , very simple to play . Take a card , play a card . Very easy to play and does n't take that long . If you like games this is n't a terrible choice .	1
Fluxx gets a lot of tepid reviews from players claiming the game is too random and contains too much luck . Well , those aspects are true . You can totally be winning at one point and in the very next turn , you 'll be furthest away from victory . As long as you are aware of this element , Fluxx is an entertaining little card game.I use Fluxx to introduce my friends and family to the deeper world of board games . Its just nice to be able to share your hobby with others and not intimidate them . I am also a fan of sci-fi and the reference in Star Fluxx are nice little bonuses.Sometimes you win a lot . Sometimes you lose a lot . Its really about how much of it feels controllable . By yourself , its absolutely manageable . Oh but this is a game with others . How foolish to expect any outcome at all . Well at some point you 'll draw a correlation between who you play with and how much you enjoy the game . You might not like the results , but therein lies the most important choice you 'll ever make in this game : who you play with .	1
Great card game , with completely different style of play and rules than you will be used too . There are many types of Fluxx games available , but when I saw Star Fluxx , I did n't even consider buying any of the others ( OK , maybe the Monty Python , but I think the non-trademark style of the cards makes Star Fluxx so fun and hilarious ) . This was my first time playing Fluxx and I did n't have any problems understanding the rules , but I do find myself forgetting some of my keeper powers , but thats just the fun of playing , knowing you may have been able to win last round if you had done x , y , or z . Of course , since there are many pathways to victory , there are also many pathways to have victory snatched from you , completely unrelated to your own stupidity . Most Star Fluxx games for us become a battle of attrition , to see how long you can play before someone gets lucky enough to have the right keepers , without anyone being able to foil their victory .	1
As seen on Tabletop with Wil Wheaton , this game is fabulous . Love playing with my nephews ( ages 8-14 ) - the whole family loves it !	1
good game great game to pass the time . anyone can play and it is easy to understand . we paly it all the time and we try to stick each other . That is the fun part of it .	1
With a fast pace and ever-changing rules and goals , this is a great game , especially if you might be pressed for time ( my wife and I finished a game in about 5 minutes , which , of course , all depends on the shuffling of the deck ) . Pulling sci-fi elements from multiple sources ( Star Trek , Star Wars , 2001 : A Space Odyssey , and Firefly , to name a few ) , you , too , can enjoy trying to put together a crew of spacemen or discover an city of robots . Well worth the minimal cost of the deck , this game has me interested in getting some of the other themes in the Fluxx line .	1
This is a space themed version of the game Fluxx . A lot of first time players find Fluxx to be complicated but once you understand the mechanics of it then its actually a simple and fun game to play.To win the game you have to match your hand ( called keepers which are face up on the table in front of you ) with the current goal in play . For example , the goal might be to have the captain , doctor , expendable crewman , and one other crewman card.The game starts off by drawing a card and playing a card . You can put keeper cards down as part of your turn but you may also play a rule card or goal card , etc . A goal card changes the winning objective . A rule card might change how many cards to draw during your turn . The game gets crazier when players have cards to steal keepers or cancel actions.Also in the mix are creepers which are cards that attach themselves to other cards for better or worse . Typically a creeper prevents you from winning the game tho some goals might actually require it.I recommend at least 3-4 players for this game as it does get a little too predictable when you have only two players.The best thing about this game is because the goal can change and discarded cards can come back into play nobody is every out of contention to win the game .	1
I bought this for my son for Christmas . He loves playing it and so do his friends . Fun and easy to learn . Different . The more you play the better . Recommended .	1
I love the Fluxx series so much , and while I may play some of the other versions more often ( I 'll explain why at the end of this review ) , this and Monty Python Fluxx are my two absolute favorites ! Fluxx is the perfect go-to game if you want something fast-paced , fun and easy to learn . Because the explanation and basic rules of the game are so simple , I 've found that it 's equally fun for brand-new players as for those who 've played it before . Everything is explained on each card , so you can give very minimal instructions to new players and they 'll pick it up easily . We usually use this as a warm-up game on game nights with friends and family , before moving on to more strategy-based games.Since I mentioned strategy , I will give you one word of caution : this is not a game for those who are looking for something with elaborate strategy and get frustrated when the plan they 've been working on for several rounds either does n't work out or backfires . The nature of the game is to be ever-changing , so you have to be willing to go with the flow . You can have some strategy , of course , but you have to be willing to see it blow up in front of you in seconds -- and then laugh about it ! A word about this version of the game : in my opinion , this particular version is best played when you 're playing with fans of Sci Fi . This version is based around references to popular sci-fi film and television series ( Star Wars , Star Trek , Dr. Who , etc . ) , and really I think it 's funniest when you understand the references . It is playable with people who do n't know their Sci Fi , but I do n't think it 's as much fun for them . Also , because of the special powers of some cards in the game it is a slightly more complex version of Fluxx than others -- I would n't start anyone out with this unless they 're playing with others that have played it before .	1
We love playing this game . The re play is high and it 's good value for the price of the deck . I just wish my husband would n't take it to work and leave it there . I 'd like to play it more !	1
So . Much . Fun . It 's a great card game , really easy to learn , can be played with both adults and kids , and on top of it all , makes fun of science fiction shows and movies we all love .	1
Keep your Fluxx play in more flux by adding Star Fluxx or playing it stand-alone . While this is not our favorite theme Fluxx game it mixes well with any of the others and plays well on it 's own too . If you 've ever played any other Fluxx and have a desire to reach for the stars then this one might just be for you .	1
I 'd like to try a couple of the other fluxx games as well , but being a sci-fi geek , had to get this one first . The always-changing rule structure is genius . I only like certain kinds of card games and this definitely makes the list .	1
I have about four different Fluxx card games and this is my favorite . This is definitely a must have for Scifi fans . The best addition to this version are creepers that attach themselves to Keepers .	1
If you are introducing the game to new players , make sure they are comfortable with variable goals or you will be in for a frustrating game . If you can deal with the fluctuating rules and changing goals , then this is a fun game . This edition has a special appeal for science fiction fans with all the in-jokes and nods to various popular stories/movies/tv shows .	1
There may be a way to win this game other than by pure luck , but we 've yet to find it . Still , the gameplay is fun , and the cards witty .	1
This card game is so much fun.The rules are super simple so it 's a great game for young children.My gaming group loves games like munchkin and betray at house on the hill.So this game fits right in . The game plays as follows everyone gets 3 card to start . To win the game you have to have the cards in play that are on the goal card that is in play . Each turn you draw one card and play one card . ( Unless a card allows you to do more of either. ) . Now here is where it gets fun . EVERYTHING can change and does you can play cards that change how many cards are drawn and played , how many cards you can have in your hand , and the most fun you can change the goal on your turn . The star edition of this game has a bunch of dr. Who , Star Wars and Star Trek references . Such as the & # 34 ; light sword & # 34 ; .Star fluxx was also featured on tabletop with wil Wheaton [ ... ] That is a link to a video showing them playing it . It is worth watching .	1
Fluxx is fun . I picked this particular version because it seemed like the one that would appeal to my group of friends more than any of the others . We have played a couple of times , but that 's about it . The novelty wore off pretty quickly and we have n't really touched it since.I think this game might come out a few times a year from here on out , but it seems like you need several dedicated players all ready for it at the same time . You ca n't just bust it out at a party and be like & # 34 ; Whoo ! Who wants to play some FLUXX ? ! & # 34 ; because then everyone around will sort of stare at you awkwardly until one guy comes up and says & # 34 ; Not now , man ; we 're trying to conduct a bris ! & # 34 ; and then you 'll look stupid because you 're not even Jewish do n't actually know anyone at this party.What I 'm trying to say is that I enjoy the IDEA of Fluxx a little better than I enjoy the actual game . It 's chaotic , and difficult to keep track of what 's going on at any given time . I understand that 's supposed to be part of the appeal of the game , but unless everyone has played the game before , you end up having to teach the game to a new person every single game , which ends up slowing everyone down and sapping a lot of the fun.Bottom line , if you have friends who are looking for a game you can all play repeatedly and is different every single time , you can do way worse than Fluxx . But if you 're looking for a casual party game , this might not be a great match for you .	1
This is your standard late period Fluxx game with New Rules & Action Cards you 've seen before in other sets and Action Cards that are by-and-large the same as in your other sets . There are four new cards that may be played out-of-term to mess with other player 's card plays.But the clever part is in the Goal , Keeper and Creeper cards , which manage to evoke every popular Sci-Fi `` vehicle '' you 've heard of ( and maybe some you have n't ) without actually requiring a license from any of the IP owners . This is so clever I have no way to describe it.Play is the usual `` define the game as you play '' affair . The theme is an amusing and clever one , as I 've said . I recommend it , though my favourite variant is still Martian Fluxx .	1
Keeps you on your toes . constantly changing so you do n't get bored . Very clever and funny similarities with Star-Geek stuff	1
We own original , zombie , martian , pirate and star . While we do play the others we always choose this one first . When playing with new players we always choose this version as well . Our favorite , by far . We really enjoy the Keepers in this version as most have additional `` powers '' that go along with them . Also , the surprise cards are lots of fun ( or a pain in the arse , depending on what end you are on , lol ) .	1
Since every American kid and quite a few non-American ones are familiar with the Wizard of Oz , this ever-changing card game based on the Oz theme is fun for all ages . Nothing really scary here , just non-threatening , non-competitive family enjoyment . : -D	1
okay so i am in love with the wizard of oz ! and when i started to inot the world of Fluxx , i knew i had to buy myself a copy of the game . i had played star fluxx and wanted that but when OZ popped up . i could n't say no ! the box of cards come in perfect shape . but after a few days the box started to rip on the sides . ive had to type them . but the cards remain in great shape . it 's a fun game of never ending change . and is a great party game . once you understand the basic 's your golden .	1
We had so much fun playing this the day we got it . I love the creepers , new action and rule cards , and the fun combinations of the goal cards , never a dull moment , so it keeps it fun . We played for about 3 hours straight . Enjoy it , we sure did = )	1
I love the Fluxx series so much ! The base game is so easy to learn , and a lot of fun to play . I bought this for a family member with a particular love of the Wizard of Oz , but we 've all played it and had such a blast . I have given different versions to all of my game-loving friends and family , and I love all of them . I would say that between this and the original Fluxx the themes are the most universally recognized and funny for everyone , so they 're good choices to play with any group.Fluxx is the perfect go-to game if you want something fast-paced , fun and easy to learn . Because the explanation and basic rules of the game are so simple , I 've found that it 's equally fun for brand-new players as for those who 've played it before . Everything is explained on each card , so you can give very minimal instructions to new players and they 'll pick it up easily . We usually use this as a warm-up game on game nights with friends and family , before moving on to more strategy-based games.Since I mentioned strategy , I will give you one word of caution : this is not a game for those who are looking for something with elaborate strategy and get frustrated when the plan they 've been working on for several rounds either does n't work out or backfires . The nature of the game is to be ever-changing , so you have to be willing to go with the flow . You can have some strategy , of course , but you have to be willing to see it blow up in front of you in seconds -- and then laugh about it ! A word about the theme versions of the game : this particular version makes so many references to the Wizard of Oz that you will find charming and hysterical if you 've read the books or seen the film/s ( and really , who has n't ? ) , but if any player does n't know about Dorothy and friends , they may not get some of the humor of it . I own several of the other versions ( Star Fluxx , Monty Python Fluxx , Zombie Fluxx ) , and I actually find Oz Fluxx the easiest to play and have EVERYONE get the references -- maybe even more so than the original Fluxx . I find that particularly with Star Fluxx and Monty Python Fluxx , while everyone enjoys themselves those versions are a lot funnier to those of us who understand the references !	1
Fluxx is an always changing game that is quick to learn and provides a lot of replay value since the goal for winning will be different not only every time you play but multiple times during any game . 2+ players and keep in mind the game will again be different when you add that 3rd and 4th player . We own several themes of Fluxx with Oz being one of our favorites .	1
Out of all the fluxx I 've played this is my favorite . Although it seems as if someone always wins pretty fast . Still really fun ! Highly recomended for game night !	1
This game uses the original Fluxx rules , and thrusts them squarely into a Lovecraft theme . The game play is relatively straightforward : ( 1 ) collect `` keeper '' cards in front of you while avoiding zombie cards , ( 2 ) play `` global '' cards that change the rules of the game , ( 3 ) attempt to collect the right combination of `` keeper '' cards to satisfy the ever-changing goal conditions.This game can be played as a standalone set and is also compatible with any of the Fluxx sets , although I 've found that the game play is usually a bit stilted and less enjoyable with other sets mixed in . Although I 'm a big fan of the Zombie Fluxx set , this version is far and away the best . The combination of additional rules and attention to Lovecraftian detail set a new bar for the Fluxx series.Each card contains its own set of rules that affect game play , so each card contains ( often substantial ) text.The game is fairly flexible in terms of the number of players it can accommodate , but somewhere between 2-5 is probably best . If you stick to those numbers , a game will usually take around 15-30 minutes . ( unlike the Zombies set , 2 player games are actually quite fun ) .Overall , the game is portable , fast-paced , and often amusing.APPROPRIATE AUDIENCE : Hardcore gamers will enjoy this as a `` warm-up '' between their more complicated gaming sessions . It 's also a very useful tool for introducing newcomers to these kinds of games.Finally , this particular set is , of course , Lovedraft themed -- in other words , if the player does n't enjoy Cthulhu and cultist jokes , you are better off getting a different set of Fluxx cards ( Star Fluxx for sci-fi fans , Zombie Fluxx for zombie fans , etc ) .OVERALL SCORE : A- The game is a lot of fun , and holds up very well even after repeated plays .	1
I got this as a birthday gift for a board-game-and-cthulhu-lover.We go back and forth on the games we 'll play . I 'm into strategy and spatial games : days of wonder games , carcassonne , blokus , that sort of thing . He likes storied RPGs . I *really* do n't like the Mars Attacks ! and Last NIght on Earth games , but the birthday lad sure does.I was hoping this one would meet us in the middle.My SO prefers my games , and was quite concerned as we went over , gift bag in hand . & # 34 ; You realize we 're going to play that now , right ? & # 34 ; & # 34 ; Yeah , but it 's HIS birthday . I did n't buy it for us , I bought it for him ! & # 34 ; His wife was even more concerned , and threw me a few dagger looks . Apparently she does n't care much for tentacles . Whoops ! Fortunately , it went over well with everyone . The birthday lad loved it . His wife liked it ( winning the first round helped ) , and found the tentacles were small enough not to bother her . Ahem . My SO and I tolerated it well , though it 's not going to hit our favorites any time soon . Best of all , it 's short.Happy gaming , folks - hope this helped !	1
My hubby is a Lovecraft fan and enjoys games , at least easy to learn ones . So he got this for father 's day . We were able to pick up and play a couple games right away and it 's alot of fun . The & # 34 ; single deck & # 34 ; in the title is misleading , you get the full game . The artwork is very cool and fans will enjoy the characters and places from HP Lovecraft novels .	1
A simple yet challenging game . The rules start out very simple and then they keep changing . Having Cthulhu around just makes it even better .	1
Cthulhu Fluxx is a pretty cool card game . The atmosphere of H.P . Lovecraft 's Cthulhu Mythos is astounding . Lots of Creepers and Keepers ! Fluxx Card Games are cool since the rules are always changing . Fluxx games are fast to play and easily understandable . This is a fun game , even when 'Darkness wins ' .	1
I am a big fan of Lovecraft . I enjoy his work , and feel sympathy for him as I read . He was dealt a rough hand in life , and I think it really shows in his work . Melancholy , sometimes depressing , with little hope or cheer ; but exciting and thoughtful , as well . I buy some of the merchandise ( games , plush , etc . ) , but sometimes feel that the spirit of his work gets lost . I do not feel that this is the really the case with this Fluxx game though.As with all Fluxx games , the rules constantly change . You may be doing great then BAM ! You 're way behind everyone else . There is really no strategy , mainly just luck and trying your best . The cards are different in this version , darker of course . One card I got made everyone tell a fear they had , for example . It 's pretty fun , and the game can last just a few minutes ( seriously , we had a three player game once that ended in about 2 minutes ) , or it can go on for quite awhile ( well over an hour ) . I think it 's fun in any size group , and the price amazon has it for is really good . I would n't recommend this for smaller children , as there is reading , they might not enjoy the artwork , and depending on the length of the game they get bored . Great for Lovecraft fans though !	1
Keith Baker , the designer of Cthulhu Fluxx , gets the Lovecraftian point : in a mad universe in which the forces of unreason will inevitably destroy us all , only random , idiot chaos wins . This is what makes Cthulhu Fluxx so much fun to play.You ca n't win with the various Creepers , but you probably ca n't win without them , either . The Ungoals throw the game to the forces of evil , and even the regular Goals are delightfully twisted ( `` The player who has Federal Agents and the Drunk on the table wins '' ) . If you know your Lovecraft , you 'll enjoy getting the story references , and if you do n't , it does n't affect the gameplay . As usual with Fluxx , sheer luck determines the winner , but in Fluxx , unlike , say , chess , winning is n't the point . You get to play with madness , and is n't that cool ? This is by far the best version of Fluxx I 've ever played . It 's more complex thanZombie Fluxx , nowhere near as coy asStar Fluxx , and unlikeStoner Fluxxyou do n't have to be high to enjoy it .	1
Perfect for older children who like to color but are to old for normal coloring books . Its fun watching the pictures come to life .	1
my daughter is 5 1/2 and we are having fun with the color by number . She takes one part and I take the other . I was concerned she may have difficulty with the smaller spaces but she has been up to the challenge and really enjoys it . I 've also been having a good time .	1
Bought this for a 5 year old girl . She loves crafts and coloring . She loves doing the color by numbers to make some great colored pictures . Would definitely recommend this book .	1
I got this last year for my 6yo and he loves it ! As another reviewer said , make sure you either know your less common colors really well or have pencils with the color names on them . Having the identical picture without the numbers is really nice . You can use the page with the numbers to guide in redoing that page , giving it a clearer look because the numbers are n't in the way . Or you can use different colors for a different look . I definitely recommend doing the numbered pictures first .	1
These color-by-number books are intense ! They 've definitely kept the kids busy , and the pics are VERY detailed and intricate . My 4 year-old needs some assistance , but my 7 year-old loves it . However , it 's challenging enough for really any age . Our 13 year-old cousin came over and was enthralled , too !	1
This was a fave of my wife as a kid . Our 6yo loves art , drawing , coloring , etc . She 'd never had one of these before , but absolutely loved it . Totally worth it . Also the Amazon price actually beat the Michael 's price ; that 's not always the case , but it was this time .	1
The pictures are awesome and very detailed . I do have to sit with her to work on this as it is a bit of a challenge for my differently able 10 yr old daughter . But she is very proud of the results she gets . Make sure you use sharp color pencils as some of the sections are very small . But I would recommend this product and it 's quality .	1
I ordered all the the Mimdwear Books I couldfind at Amazon for Christmas , and as I looked at them I was very pleased with the content and the exterior , they seem to be top quality - I would recommend these in a heartbeat . I am sure my little granddaughter will love them come Christmas morning .	1
These books are so much fun . They provide hours of creativity and fun . We have many of these coloring books and pass away many hours coloring in them	1
This is a worker placement game with strategy and a bit of luck . It is a plan your moves ahead of time kind of game . I like this game . I have played it once and I bought it for it 's simplicity after you get to know what the symbols and buildings mean . It takes a bit to read and understand the instructions as there is a lot going on .	1
I bought this game hoping to play it with friends , but to my amazement my non-gamer wife saw it and asked to play it ! Awesome !	1
This is a great strategy game . I learned it at a friend 's house recently ( they 're major & picky gamers ) and fell in love . I got it and now am taking it around teaching others in our gaming circles . Really solid game . It 's like five mini-games that are seamlessly woven together for one cohesive game . Has some structural similarities to 7 Wonders . Recommend that you get together a game of 4 people and get them to help you put all the numbered stickers on the people as soon as you get it . Also suggest that you find someone else who knows how to play to teach you - you can learn via the instruction manual , but there are so many moving parts that your first game will be super slow . Maybe I and my boyfriend will make a video in the near future to help y'all out .	1
We love playing this game . We choose a board game to play 3 nights a week so we have a wide variety and this one is probably the most fun to play !	1
This is an interesting worker placement game.The main hook is the cost of time . In addition to placing your workers , when you place them , an amount of time has to pass . Once enough time has passed , one of your oldest generation of workers dies . They 're removed from the game , and depending on what job they were doing at the time , they 're either placed into the history book of the village or they 're put into an unmarked grave.Victory points are scored by servicing customers that come to the village , by having a number of citizens in the history book of the village , by traveling , and by being in the church.The game ends when either the history book , or a certain number of unmarked graves are filled.It 's a fairly tight worker placement game , with two player games lasting 45 minutes to an hour .	1
This game was an interesting addition to our board game collection ( which numbers over 150 games and expansions ) . I had originally looked at buying this game for a friend for his birthday but my wife and I decided to keep it based on Tom Vassel 's review on Dice Tower.Overall it is a good game with a very interesting , multi-path , scoring system . Unfortunately there is only really 1 path to winning and once my gaming group figured it out we all do the same thing , which takes away from the replay ability . After a few weeks it ended up on the shelf and I look forward to trying it out again in a few months.I gave it a 4 star rating because it really is a well put together game , the lack of a replay value might have given it a 3 star but I honestly do n't want to discourage anyone from buying this product.As always , the best price was here on Amazon and my local game shop did n't have any .	1
The average time to play this game is probably closer to 2 hours when you first start to play it . Not because the game itself takes that long , but because the players will take their time to consider what each action can or can not do for them . Once the game 's actions are well understood , you can actually complete this game within 1 hour or less , depending on the group size . Just note that your first couple of game plays will not be swift.My Child Geek , at the young age of 8 , understood the rules of the game , could play the game with little assistance , and even made some excellent moves to collect points . He also disliked the game . A lot . He was , in his own words , `` bored to tears '' . Euro-style games are the game equivalent of a period piece dramatic film . Deep and involved , but feel like they are moving at a snail 's pace . This was not lost on my son or any of the other Child Geeks we played the game with . While very playable , Village did n't keep their interest for very long.Parent Geeks very much enjoyed the game , and thought it was an excellent choice for family game night . They were saddened , of course , to see that their younger Child Geeks were not willing to play the game based on its duration and cerebral demand , but they also recognized that this was a game meant to be played with an older and more patient audience . Child Geeks as young at 7 could play the game , but Child Geeks only started to enjoy the game around age 10 . Even then , their level of engagement with the game and the other players was somewhat shallow , but improved as the player became older . Based on this and how much the Parent Geeks enjoyed the game play , they approved it.A Gamer Geek 's level of enjoyment with the game was based on their enjoyment of Euro-style games . Those Gamer Geeks who detested Euro-style games naturally disliked Village . Those who enjoyed Euro-style games loved it . There was nothing in the game play or the rules to suggest that the game was a bad one ( in fact , several comments were made regarding the excellent component quality and design ) , and all the Gamer Geeks , be they Ameritrash devotees or classic Euro-style zealots , all agreed the game was a good one.Gamer Geeks , your level of enjoyment with this game is primarily based on your point-of-view of Euro-style games . If you do n't like Euro-style games , skip Village . If you do , you 'll find Village to be a fun and challenging game that introduces a new resource seldom seen : Time . This was perhaps the biggest draw to the game , as it gave all the players another way to pay for actions . This gave the players much more to think about , too , as it opened many new possible methods of wining . While the use of time as a resource is unique , the game itself is hardly groundbreaking . You 'll be pushing cubes , moving meeples , collecting resources , and spending them in the same way you 've done before with other Euro-style games . While not a detractor , just be aware of it before you go buying it for your game collection.Parent Geeks , this is a very well designed family game in the Euro-game style of play . The players are never in direct conflict with each other which allows for casual play and easy table conversation . The game is challenging and every player will always be forced to make a choice of `` pay now '' or `` pay later '' . This game will also challenge a player based on the many choices it provides . There are multiple ways to gain points and even more ways to streamline a single round to come out on top.Child Geeks , this game is going to be a bit too much for you unless you already are familiar with and have the patience for Euro-style games . This is not a fast game , nor will it create any real sense of adventure or excitement . You 'll find that the best way to play the game is silently , deep in thought , and half-crazed with speculation . That does n't sound like much fun , does it ? One day , you 'll have the mental stamina and geek skills to sit down and play this game like a Boss . Until then , keep playing the many , many other games available to you that are lighter and more entertaining.Village has been dubbed , by some , as a `` modern Euro-style game '' . I fail to see any level of modernization , as the game is steeped with Euro-style game mechanisms that have been around for a long time . I also fail to see any real originality in the game , although the currency of time is a very neat idea . However , its uniqueness will eventually become unnoticeable after a few game plays . `` Time '' will become nothing more than just one more resource to be used and pushed around the board . I guarantee you 'll miss it when you play other Euro-style games , however.Village is solid game , but does not provide anything you ca n't get from other Euro-style games on the market today . Which is to say , it has passive game play , simple rules , plausible choices , short downtime , zero luck , and a scoring system that always keeps a player 's marker moving forward . For those players who like Euro-style games , they 'll no doubt enjoy Village . For those looking for excitement , the game will fail . This is a game about efficiency , about making small but meaningful choices again and again , and to slowly gain points over a period of time . The game is an exercise in long-term planning and feels rewarding to those who like to see complex strategies come together . Again , think of a period piece dramatic film , and you 've got a very good idea how Village feels.Personally , I rather enjoyed Village , finding it fun and challenging to play with potentially a lot of replayability . I say `` potentially '' , because after playing it a number of times in a row , no one wants to play it with me . Still , it 's a good game and one I would gladly play again . I , however , would have a hard time recommending Village to someone not familiar with Euro-style games . If you are and are looking for a new game to add to your table , Village is sure to please . **This game was given to Father Geek as a review copy .

This is a great game , it has a lot of depth . There are multiple ways to play the game to win . You can focus your efforts in one area or diversify to gain honor in your village in several areas . This game has tons of replay value . I have been playing it with my 9 and 10 year old kids despite the 12 and up tag . It is simple enough that they were easily able to play it , and complex enough that it is fun to play again and again . 5 stars , this is a great game !	1
In Village , an award winning strategy game designed by Inka and Markus Brand , you 'll be taking control of several generations of workers , and through steady work and tough decisions , attempt to ensure that their accomplishments are valued and recognized after their passing . Will you be able to pilot your family 's fortunes to glory ? Will the names of your Village family members enter the chronicles of history , crowned with victory points ? Can you make the tough life and death decisions that will ensure that your deeds live on long after you do ? That 's the challenge that awaits in Village.It 's worth noting that this game has made some history of its own , having won a slew of awards - most notably the 2012 Kennerspiel award from the Spiel des Jahres folks - and has rightly received accolades for being one of the best strategic euro games to see publication in recent years . Here are some reasons why:1 . It 's a quintessential euro . Cube-pushing , euro-point salad , multiple paths to victory , time frame of 60 to 90 minutes , medieval village theme - all these are elements typical of the genre , and Village is an excellent example of its class.2 . It 's an innovative euro . What sets Village apart from other worker placement type euros , is that it does introduce something genuinely new , by having a mechanic where your workers die as the game progresses.3 . It 's a thematic euro . As with most euros , the gameplay of Village is somewhat dry , but it does have a theme , and it 's much stronger here than it is in many a euro.4 . It 's a beautiful euro . The beautiful artwork on the board and components helps strengthen the theme , and adds to the appeal of the game.5 . It 's a complex euro . It 's more complex than games like Settlers of Catan or Carcassonne , and is certainly one or two steps up from your average gateway game.6 . It 's a strategic euro . The increased complexity also means that you 'll definitely be getting a good strategic workout , with many different strategies to try and to explore ! 7 . It 's a reasonably quick euro . Games usually take less than 30 minutes a player.8 . It 's a non-confrontational euro . Village is n't exactly multi-player solitaire , because you are competing for cubes and action spaces , but the interaction is more competitive than confrontational , and never feels mean or nasty.9 . It 's a very enjoyable euro . Some euros are dry and dull , but the folks I played with all found Village thoroughly enjoyable and rewarding , and the more we played the more we wanted to play again ! If you approach Village as a quintessential cube-pushing euro , you will really appreciate what new mechanics it introduces and what theme is present . It may not be a ground-breaking game set to alter the direction and design of modern games , but it does offer a fresh approach to a well worn genre , and it 's certainly a splendid example of an attractive and thematic euro done well . As such , Village should deservedly go down in the history books as a worthy winner of the Kennerspiel award . This is an outstanding euro , that rightly comes highly recommended , and which fans of euro games should not miss . - EndersGame @ BGG	1
Village entertains both my husband and me very much ! Our 9 yr old son is begging us to play with him ( he watched us play once and thinks it looks super fun ! ) . And , he 's right . It is super fun.You essentially send your family members out into different areas of the & # 34 ; world & # 34 ; . Then , you have to make choices on which people remain involved to get you things ( which lead to Victory points ) and which players , ever so sadly , die . It 's strategic decisions that dictate who dies and when ( also a way to get victory points is to strategically kill off your family members so they get a place in the village chronicles ... ..so , dying can equal loads of victory points ! ) . Of course , it 's difficult to sum up how to play a game like this ina review . The main point is , it 's fun and it 's different . We have a great time with this one ! ! I think the expansion ( The Village Inn which is essentially a pub with some other extras ) would be very fun ! I look forward to getting that at some point.Play mostly 2 player . Probably takes somewhere between 1 and 1.5 hours to play , depending . And , not a terribly difficult learning curve . You do have to read the manual and have a trial game , of course , as is the case with all of these types of games.100 % recommend Village ! ! Just an FYI ... A few of our other favorites are Castles of Burgundy , Rialto , Tzolk'in , Dominion , London , Thurn and Taxis , Legacy , Seasons , 7 Wonders , Bora Bora , Keyflower , Le Havre ... ( ok , we have a lot of favorites ! ) ... and we are eager to learn Trajan , Terra Mystica , Among the Stars , Puerto Rico , Shadows over the Empire and Euphoria . They are all in our collection , among others : )	1
We own many Euro and Ameritrash games and play them regularly . Village is one of our favorites . It has an extremely interesting theme and several paths to victory . It has a bit of a learning curve but with a little help from game reviews ( Watch It Played , Secret Cabal ) and play throughs it only took one game to have it figured out . Loads of Fun .	1
I played it 4 times in the week I learned it . That 's rare nowadays . Also after learning and playing it once at a board game convention I bought it less than an hour later.The game is highly replayable and simple to teach . Many paths to victory . I also love the inn/bar expansion . The cards create many other paths through the game .	1
Village is a brand new board game that is familiar in some ways and unique in others . In the Village , there are several places on the board where a variety of cubes are placed , based on the number of players . On your turn , you take one cube from the area of the board where you want to perform that action : some actions are adding family members ( there are four generations that get added to the board - you start with the first generation and add the 2nd , 3rd , and 4th during the game ) , getting livestock or tools , traveling to other villages , becoming a council member , joining the clergy , or going to sell at the market . Each player takes turns until all of the cubes have been taken . Those cubes that you have collected are used to do your actions . All of that is the familiar stuff.Here is where it gets a bit different from other Euro games . Time is a factor in this game and it can be used up in several ways . One of them is by getting the plague . Up to six cubes that are randomly placed onto the board are black plague cubes , meaning that for every black cube taken during the round , you lose two time units . You can also use up time doing various tasks in the village instead of spending cubes to do actions . The second unique thing about this game is that when you run out of time , a family member dies ( some might say that you have to kill them ) .Now when a family member dies , you get to decide who dies , but it has to be a member of the youngest generation that you have left . So if you have a 1st generation member in the church and a 2nd generation member traveling , you would have to pick the 1st generation member from the church to die until all 1st generation are dead , then you have to choose a 2nd generation member until they are all dead , etc . Who you chose to die is important because when they die , you want to place them in the village chronicle , which you get points at the end of the game . Those chronicle spaces are specific to locations in the village where the person died and they are limited . So there might be three chronicle spaces for people who worked in the council and they can be filled up by any player who had a person who died working in the council . Once those spaces are filled up , you must instead bury the person in a common grave , which awards no points . So you can see how placing family members on the board during the game and choosing who should die is important.Another unique thing is that at the end of every round , a mass is held , and members can be added to the clergy and moved up in ranks during the masses , getting you more points at the end . The game ends when a player fills up either the last chronicle space or the last common grave space.I think that this game is fantastic . Not only do you get the usual dilemma of trying to get the cubes you need so that can do the actions you want , but then you have the issue of time running out and deciding who you want to die off ( or kill ! ) . Do you try to use up time quickly to kill members ( collect plague cubes and use time instead of cubes for actions ) to get them in the chronicle first to get more points , or do you try to keep them alive as long as possible so they can keep doing actions in the village that can get you more points ? I have three plays in and absolutely love this game . Great strategy , great balance , various routes to victory , unique concepts . Highly recommended .	1
Village is a boardgame for 2-4 players that will generally last you right around 60-90 minutes as indicated on the box . It is a Euro-style game , meaning it focuses on worker placement and resource-management . Each turn you will take an action by taking an 'influence cube ' from one of the various locations on the beautifully illustrated board . You get to keep the influence cube ( unless it 's a plague cube ! ) in your inventory and then fulfill the action based on the location you chose . Sometimes this means you are crafting different items , sometimes travelling the world , sometimes making new people ( through matrimony , of course ) . Either way , your goal is to manipulate these actions into ending the game with the most points.This game takes some pretty standard-issue mechanics ( the worker-placement and resource management ) and adds some neat new things . The most interesting one is the 'time ' mechanic . As you do different actions you will move a disc around your personal playerboard . Everytime it revolves completely around it you must kill off one of your oldest family members . Each member is marked with a number , 1-4 , indicating the generation , with 1 being the lowest . This means you are strategizing who is in which position in the town at the time of their death as you compete to fill the & # 34 ; Book of Legends & # 34 ; ( that 's not what it 's actually called but that 's what we call it ) on the board . The first people to die in the various professions ( essentially the available actions ) get into the book ! Everybody after that gets unmarked graves . They probably deserved it.There 's also an interesting mechanic as you battle for position in the local clergy involving pulling different meeples out of a bag.Overall the game is pretty enjoyable and really does n't last long . The rules are n't super difficult if you 've played games like this before but to gaming newbies it might be a bit much.As I say in the title , it does lack a bit of replayability . Some aspects of each game will be different - the order of the merchant tiles and the available influence cubes on each action site , however it is largely the same game each time . Of course there are plenty of different ways to win so it should stay lively for a little while . Personally I prefer games with a little something different each time , but even with that I still very much enjoy Village .	1
Winner of several gaming award nominations , Village is a nice , solid worker placement strategy game that has two of the most entertaining , quirky mechanics I 've seen in a while . First , a player 's workers rarely move after they are placed onto the board , however time is a resource in the game and as a player accumulates time their oldest workers `` die off '' . Second , players select actions by picking up goods cubes , but some goods cubes are actually time markers which give no benefit but age one 's workers . While workers on the board give some benefit , family members can earn points from beyond the grave as the player with the most dead workers of each type earns bonus points at game end . The heart of the game is still to produce items and earn points at various locations on the board but I have found that managing the `` death rate '' of my poor family members in the Village adds an entertaining level to an already fine worker placement game .	1
The reasons people like myself who are drawn to euro or indie games are because we 're maybe a little tired of our tried and true favorites , and we 're looking for something deeper and original . In classic large corporation style , well known themes , art , and gameplay are knocked off , recycled , and re-packaged ad nauseum . So we turn to smaller game developers because they have fresh ideas even if they lack the marketing and art departments of the gaming giants . So while you might get a euro game where the packaging looks like an undeveloped art student painted it ( see Agricola box ) , the trade-off is a better game experience . And in most cases the less-polished art ends up being more inviting and in the end more attractive than the overly polished products of the corporations . And while the games cost more , they 're also made with better , sturdier materials . More care is put into these games but the thing that shines with these games is that their different . They 're a NEW idea.With Village we get the total package and a truly fresh game . It 's beautiful to look at . When you first open up the board , you instantly want to play . It automatically immerses you into a medieval village and that only grows once you learn the rules and begin to play . Admittedly as I was reading the rules , I started thinking it all sounded convoluted and wondered how it would actually work . It seemed like the mechanics of the game would be imbalanced and clunky . After playing , nothing could be further from the truth . While you can take a number of paths to victory , the game makes it possible to win with all of them . Best of all , the whole experience is fun . It feels like you 're controlling the lives ( and deaths ) of your meeples . You train them to work , send them out traveling , make them politicians , and eventually end their lives in the quest to have a bigger impact and leave better legacy in the village . That might sound attractive to some but not to others , but I can say with confidence both sides will have a blast . This game is fantastic and great example of what happens when an awesome , original idea is followed through thoughtfully .	1
I had n't played this game before purchasing it , so I was a little nervous that it would be overly complex . However , it has turned out to be an excellent game . It is quite complex , but it is n't terribly hard to learn . The game is about achieving honor for your family in a medieval village . While I have never been in a medieval village trying to achieve honor for my family , the game does feel very realistic in that respect . Time is one of the main resources in the game as you go through several generations of family and nearly every action that one takes requires a certain amount of time . Family members even die over the course of the game , yet somehow the game manages to be fun and lighthearted rather than depressing . Overall , this is a beautiful , complex ( in a good way ) , challenging resource management game !	1
Fun quick game for a couple of people ! If too many people play it can get very boring waiting for you turn to come around .	1
Dungeon RollDesigned by Chris DardenPublished by Tasty Minstrel Games1 - 4 Players ( Best with 1 or 2 ) Unique Hero Rolling Dungeon Delving Dice GameBackground / IntroductionDungeon Roll is definitely not your typical dice game . If you are expecting the roll your dice three times routine , think again ! One of the things that I really enjoy about Dungeon Roll is how unique and different the game feels . You should already get that feeling just from the actual packaging of the game . I mean , the game comes in a little cardboard treasure chest and not only that but during the game when you gain treasure you actually open the chest to randomly get a piece of treasure - how cool is that . The theme is nice , the variability is great , and the quality of components awesome . The game is very light , easy to learn and does n't take long to play . There are dice involved and the game does have a large luck element to it . So , for all the hard core strategists that ca n't stand games with luck , this may not be the game for you . The game has a great variability built in with the different hero cards which really shape what kind of strategy you will play each game . In this base game , there really is n't any player interaction , so while the game makes for great solo play and is enjoyable , do n't expect to work together or attack one another in this game ( although this may change with future expansions/promos , as the soon to be released Winter Promo has some fun player interaction ) . Well , enough chit chat , let 's talk about the game in a little bit more detail.Components / RulebookOK , so I mentioned the really cool treasure chest packaging . The box actually opens like a treasure chest too . I was a bit worried that it would just rip right off the box after a few uses , but I have to give it to them - it seems to be doing very well . It may not last forever , but even if the `` hinge '' functionality of the box is lost , it is still awesome.Moving on to the dice . Being such a huge element in the game , one should expect these dice to be the really nice quality . I 'm happy to say they really are . The custom 15 dice ( 7 party dice , 7 dungeon dice , and 1 dungeon level tracker die ) are very well made and I think they will remain that way . The color coding and icons used are good and make sense.The hero cards ( 8 included in the base game , and 8 more available in the Hero Booster Pack # 1 ) in the game are printed on good card stock and each of the cards has really nice artwork . Each hero card is double sided ( one side is a Novice side and the other side is the Master side ) and abilities change when flipped over . I am disappointed that they did n't take the opportunity to provide the hero slightly differently on the Master side as each side has the same artwork of the hero . They could have changed to pose of the hero , or add armor , or something . The game also includes 4 reference cards to help remind players what each face of the die do and what treasure tokens can be obtained with their special purpose.The game includes 36 treasure tokens and 24 experience tokens . These are your usual card board cut out pieces . the pieces are good thickness and did n't have too much of a problem punching them all out . The game also includes a rulebook along with a Book of Heros . The game play is simple , and the rulebook does well to explain the game and includes some illustrations . The Book of Heroes is just a book comprised of pages summarizing the different hero cards and providing further clarifying information as necessary.SetupThe game has a very quick setup . Empty out the treasure chest if you choose to use it as your treasure token randomizer ( which you always should ! ) . Place the treasure tokens in the chest or flip them all face down if keeping them out on the table . Place the experience tokens near by . Each player can have a reference card and then each player will either choose their hero or deal these out randomly . That is it ! Goal / GameplayThe game is played by each player entering the dungeon exactly 3 times to seek glory , treasure , and to gain experience points . The winner of the game will be the one with the most experience points once everyone has tried their hand at the dungeon 3 times.On a players turn ( in general , this and other actions can be modified by a heroes special ability or ultimate ability ) the player first rolls the 7 party dice . This will represent the company of adventurers entering the dungeon with you and perhaps some scrolls ( just in case you feel like reading in the dark dangerous dungeon ) .The player will then enter the dungeon at dungeon level 1 . The dungeon level tracker die will be moved to show the number 1 face up . The dungeon lord will be rolling dice equal to the number on the dungeon level tracker die or as many available dice as able if that ca n't be reached . So , for example the dungeon lord will roll 1 of the dungeon dice for level 1 and 4 dungeon dice for level 4.The player will then enter the Monster Phase of his turn and will need to defeat or otherwise dismiss any monsters rolled ( Skeletons , Oozes , and Goblins make up the monsters you will encounter ) . This is done by using your party dice rolled at the beginning of your `` delve into the dungeon '' ( a.k.a . 1 of your 3 turns going through the dungeon ) . You may use any one adventurer die ( Clerics , Mages , Fighters , Thieves , and Champions ) to defeat any one monster die . Each type of adventurer also has specialties that help remove more of a certain kind of monster etc . These are color coded for your convenience . Example : The grey Cleric can defeat ( or in other words remove ) any number of grey Skeletons , the green Fighter can remove any number of Goblins , and the Thieves can open any number of chests ( we will discuss these soon ) . The gold Champion is pretty special , it can remove any of the same type of monster ( consider it a wild die of sorts ) .Also during the Monster Phase , you can activate your hero 's ability or ultimate ability , you can use treasure tokens , or you may use any Scrolls that you have . Scrolls allow you to re-roll any of the dice ( party and dungeon ) . Once all the monsters are removed from play , the player can then continue on to the Loot Phase where players can open chests or quaff potions . It is always optional to open chests or quaff potions . While players may not always want to open chests or quaff potions , each one of these rolled means one less monster ( or possible dragon ) . If you choose to open a chest using your dice , then you can gain a treasure token at random ( these can be really useful ! ) . If you quaff a potion ( even your scrolls can do this ) , then you can bring a party die back from the `` graveyard '' ( the place where your used party dice end up ) and you get to choose what face you want to use.Without getting into too many details about all the rules , I do need to mention the dragon and how experience tokens are obtained as well as what happens if you ca n't defeat the monsters and/or dragon at a given level . Whenever a dragon is rolled , it is set aside in an area known as the dragon 's lair ( these dice ca n't be re-rolled with the Scroll , but can be manipulated with certain hero abilities ) . After the Monster and Loot phase , it is then the Dragon Phase . If there are 3 or more dragons the hero must defeat the dragon . To do this the player must use 3 different adventurers ( or Companions as they are really called in the rulebook ) . This can be done with the help of certain treasure tokens that can act as companions too . So , here is a good spot to point out that while Champions are really versatile , you still need a variety of companions to defeat dragons . When you defeat a dragon , you receive 1 experience point and you get 1 treasure.After the Dragon Phase comes the Regroup phase . Players can now determine if they want to leave the dungeon and receive experience points equal to the number shown on the dungeon level tracker or continue to go down to the next level ( although 10 is the maximum and you are required to leave after defeating level 10 ) . If at any time you ca n't defeat the monsters or you are faced with a dragon that you ca n't defeat , you must end your delve that round without scoring any of the experience points on the die.Conclusion / Final ThoughtsI really enjoy playing Dungeon Roll . The quality of components are great and the theme really works well . The heroes and their special abilities really make the game for me as they provide unique strategies depending on your character . Dungeon Roll is just a great light dice game that can be taught and played very quickly . The base game does n't really have much as far as player interaction is concerned , but I think most players will enjoy watching to see what other players choose to do as well . Now , with 3 or 4 players , the down time between turns lengthen and may result in people not enjoying the game as much . The game fits well for a nice 2 player game as one player can always be rolling dice ( either as the hero or the dungeon lord ) . The game does have a large element of luck and that keeps the game different and challenging in its own way , but this may keep some gamers away that do n't like a large element of luck in a game to mess up all their perfectly contrived strategies . The game retails around $ 19.95 , so the price point is nice too . I am really looking forward to playing the Winter Promo pack and I ca n't wait to learn more about what they have in store for Dungeon Roll this year ( I 'm hearing that there will be some great things coming out ) . If you like dice games and you are OK with a large luck element and dungeon fighting theme , I think you should get it ! I 'm giving this game 4 Fingers Up or 9/10 Stars and that is How Lou Sees It ! A big SHOUT OUT to TMG for making this review possible . I should be receiving Coin Age and the Dungeon Roll Winter Promo over the next few months . TMG is really coming out with some great little games . Original review posted with pictures and video at [ ... ]	1
The game components are excellent and I love the custom dice . The cards have good artwork , the counters are thick and double-sided , and the box looks like a little ( 3 & # 8221 ; W x 3 & # 8221 ; L x 3 & # 8221 ; T ) treasure chest and is used to store and draw from for treasure tokens during the game.My 14-year-old son and I have played this a dozen or so times now , and it & # 8217 ; s a simple and fun game . Playing time for two players is about 15 minutes , and only slightly more for 3 or 4 players , so it & # 8217 ; s definitely a quick-play game , suitable as a warm-up game for something longer , or to play while waiting for other players to arrive . It also has a solo mode which plays exactly like the multiplayer , and strength is the biggest failing of Dungeon Roll.Playing the game is really just the player doing hand-control with his party dice vs the monster dice he is facing , pressing their luck as far as they can without being defeated and having to flee the dungeon . There is no interaction between the players at all . Yes , another player rolls the monster dice each round and keeps up with what dungeon level you are on , but there is no point where a player can take an action in their turn that affects another player at all . You are multiple players taking turns playing a solo game , and it feels that way . The only competition at all is when you add up Experience Points at the end of the game to see who had the most and therefore won.Still , Dungeon Roll is fast , well-themed , well made and despite the lack of interaction , it is still fun . For the price , it & # 8217 ; s worth picking up if you play games like Zombie Dice or Cthulhu Dice , or just want a simple filler game with nice components.We & # 8217 ; ll be playing this one for years to come .	1

Each Hero also has a Special Ability that can be used anytime and and Ultimate Ability that can only be used once per delve into the Dungeon . Hero can level up once after gaining enough experience points to help their special abilities.The game is played in the rounds or each playing delving into the dungeon three times each . The first player then rolls the 7 white dice to determine their party that may include Champions , Fighters , Wizards , Thieves and Clerics . The person to the Players left is the Dungeon Lord and rolls the Dungeon Dice as well as tracks the current players lever with the Level Die.The players turn consists of four different phases : The Monster Phase : The active player uses his companions ( Champions , Fighters , Mages , Thieves and Clerics ) to battle the Monster Dice ( Skeleton , Goblins and Oozes . ) Any Dragon dice rolled are set off to the side to be faced later if three or more Dragons are rolled . Once a companion is used to battle a monster is put in the graveyard and can not be used again unless brought back with a potion later in the turn sequence . Dungeon Dice are returned to the Dungeon Pool to be reused again . The current player can press their luck and go deeper into the dungeon increasing the level on the Level Die and gaining more experience points . Level 1 , one Dungeon Die is rolled , Level 2 , two Dungeon Dice are rolled etc . If a player fails to defeat the current level , they must flee the Dungeon and their delve is over with out gaining any experience.The Loot Phase : The player can choose to do these in any order.Open Chests : One Thief or Champion may open any number of chests and all other companions can open a single chest.Quaff Potions : Any companion ( including scroll die ) can be used to quaff any number of potion dice . One potion equals on companion resurrected from the graveyard.Dragon Phase : If there have been 3 Dragon Dice rolled then the current adventurer must battle the Dragon ! The adventurer can only defeat the Dragon if they have 3 different companions to battle it with . If there are not 3 Dragon Dice , skip this phase.Regroup Phase : Here the adventurer retires to the tavern . They collect experience points equal to the level they achieved on the Level Die . If the adventurer was brave enough and somehow made it all the way to Level 10 on this delve , they must retire and collect 10 experience points . The adventurer can keep seeking glory by going deeper into the Dungeon if they have not achieved Level 10 yet . Remember if the adventurer can not defeat all the Monster Die , they must flee the Dungeon and no experience points are gained.Once the delve is over , the adventurer passes the dice to the left and play begins again with that player.Once all the adventurers have completed all three delves the game is over and the players count up their experience points . The one with the most wins ! Treasure : When a chest is opened during the Monster Phase , the current player gets to retrieve treasure from the Dungeon . These can be used during a players turn if applicable like a fighter token or a mage token which acts as an additional companion die . Once the toke is used it is returned to the box . All unused treasure tokens count as experience points at the end for the player that has them.The components for Dungeon Roll are very good . The artwork is very nice , the dice are high quality with cool graphics and the tokens are small but serviceable and sturdy . The box is a cool treasure chest look for the packaging but I can see the lip on the inside getting damaged fairly easy so take care when closing the box . The Hero Cards are very attractive and of decent quality . As much room as in on the card , the text could have been bigger for people with eyesight issues but that is a super small quibble.Dungeon Roll is an very fun , quick romp through the dungeon and in some ways the theme really comes through . This is a great filler game or travel game as it all fits in the small treasure box and is playable anywhere anytime as it really only lasts about 15 minutes each game . Designer Chris Darden did a great job of finding a way to mix the luck of dice rolling with strategy and the feel of a dungeon crawl in such a small , compact quick game . This is a winning design and game . Great job Chris and Tasty Minstrel Games.I am giving this game 7 out 10 stars as it is very fun , quick and thematic at its core with just the right amount of luck and strategy for a filler game that keeps everyone engaged and is going to be great fun for kids and adults.This review was originally posted here : [ ... ]	1
As far as simple dice rolling games that carry a theme go , Dungeon Roll is the creme of the crop . It is instantly fun and easily learned . It cane be taught in minutes as the game is played . A variety of characters to play as gives a new spin each time the game is played . The game boils down to a push your luck model where players are delving further and further into a dungeon . The higher the level the player chooses to venture into , the more dice that get rolled which means more monsters and more chances for the dreaded dragon dice to hit the table . Three dragon dice and the dragon lair must be entered where the player will have to fight the dragon or lose all of their progress ( and thus any chance at experience points that round ! ) .The game is recommended for ages 6+ , but I have been playing with my 4 year old son and while he needs guidance , he is fully capable of playing the basic concept of the game . I suspect in a year he will have it nearly mastered in all but the most complex of possible scenarios the game can throw . If you have children that love chucking hand fulls of dice ; this is the game to get them . Though keep in mind that only one player plays at a time so there is down time for other players ( though I find it best to use that down time to heckle the current player to push their luck just a little bit further ! ) .The only draw back I have for the game is that the rules are laid out poorly ( I highly recommend watching the Watch It Played series on YouTube to learn the game very quickly ) Oh , and there is one rule that in my opinion kind of spoils the game . At the end of the game each treasure that has not been used is meant to count as one experience point . This encourages hoarding of treasures instead of using them to & # 34 ; push your luck & # 34 ; and delve further into each dungeon run which to me is the entire point of the game . I highly recommend having a house rule where the only items worth experience at the end of the game are : town portals ( worth 2xp if not used ) and 2 dragon scales = 2 points ( 1 dragon scale = no points ) . All other unused loot is simply discarded . With this simple rule I have found the game to be much more even between multiple players and it no longer ends up being the guy who was lucky enough to roll the most treasure chests that wins by default . Players are also far more willing to push their luck as they have no incentive to hoard items .	1
Dungeon Roll is a simple and unique game where the player ( s ) proceed through a dungeon defeating monsters , gaining treasure , and leveling up . The gameplay is quick and since there are many characters each with a unique feel to try out so there 's a lot of replay value . So , a game might take 10-20 minutes and you could be back in the dungeon with a new set of characters in no time . The dice , and all of the components , are really high quality . The biggest drawback for myself is the highly random game play that comes with it being a dice game , and the game is a bit light on theme because it 's the mission is simply to slay monsters , collect treasure , and make it as deep into the dungeon as possible to gain XPs . The rulebook is also a little vague , so it might take a couple of plays to figure it all out , but luckily it 's very quick to start up another game.Pros : Excellent ComponentsAwesome DiceQuick GameplayLots of Replay ValueCons : Very RandomLight ThemeMurkey RulebookMy wife did n't enjoy the game much and she 's my go to gaming partner . The light theme is what killed it for her . I really like playing it as a quick solo game . I can set it up , play a game , and have it put away in less than 15 minutes if I 'm just looking for something to do , and the high replay value means no two games I 've played have been the same.Update : Just back to say I still think this game has sticking power . It 's always a different experience , and there 's a certain joy to getting an incredibly lucky room in the dungeon stuffed with treasure or health potions .	1
For some reason I totally blanked on the age-range for this game . My son is 7 . Fortunately , there are Basic and Advanced rules . I found the Basic rules were sufficiently & # 34 ; difficult & # 34 ; and understandable . We play with just three players , but it 's easy to see how more players = more fun . I happen to drive a manual transmission ( and 6-speed to boot , just like the game ) so it was a good opportunity for my son to get a grasp on the concept of changing gears.We have so much fun that my son actually plays multiple cars against himself , with the only the sound of tumbling dice . Wonderful .	1
This is a pretty fun group game , but can drag a bit with multiple players . This is because people want to calculate their moves on the board before committing to the best possible route . A fun variation we like to play is that when you start your turn , you declare your gear and then roll . Once you roll , you 'drive ' the car the necessary moves . No take backs , no do overs . This encourages players to pay attention to their car when it is not their turn , and also adds and element of hazard that would be present in a real driving\racing situation . Makes a good party game , but you may want to limit games to one lap per game .	1
I love formula D ! It is a interesting mix of strategy and dumb luck . My family kind of likes it . My wife was a little frustrated with the rule book for advanced play but I found a free reference sheet online that helped clear that up . Before the reference sheet we had to go back to the rule book a lot . My child age 5 understands the basic rules but gets bored about halfway through the track . I print off a Formula De Mini track from online and found it much easier to keep his attention . I would agree with the recommended age on the box . Finally , I also ordered extra dice that helped speed the game up but I would recommend waiting to see if you like the game to make this investment .	1
In Formula D , you race around the board in a Formula 1 or street car . You switch into different gears each turn , and each gear lets you roll a different die that show a certain number of spaces ( 1st gear is 1-2 , 2nd gear is 2-4 , 3rd is 4-8 , 4th is 7-12 , etc ) . You 'll have to slow down for curves , which the game implements by forcing you to end your move a certain number of times inside each curve.The thing I like about the game is that even though it comes down to dice-rolls , it implements lots of ways to counteract a bad roll through strategic maneuvering , brakes , wearing through your tires , etc.The game is fairly well-balance . It 's not uncommon to start in the number 8 seed and still end the game in 2nd place . The game is designed so that even if you are pretty far behind , it 's not difficult to catch up ( sometimes at the very end ) which makes for a really exciting game . You also get to make a good amount of decisions and develop your own driving style . You can use a very & # 34 ; push-your-luck & # 34 ; driving style , play it safe , or anywhere in between . It 's also pretty easy to pick up and play.There is generally no clear-cut best person at this game , where a veteran player will always beat novices . My family took it a step further and set up a competition , where each final placing scores a certain number of points and determines your seed in the next race . We like this setup because it gives significance to each finish , rather than just quitting because it becomes obvious you 're not going to get 1st place.Pros : Fun and exciting themeStrategically counteract the & # 34 ; luck & # 34 ; elementCan play the same tracks and still have funCons : Will not be fun if you 're constantly getting bad rolls ( which is rare )	1
I love a great game that is unique and different than the rest.Quick and easy to learn with advanced play that will challenge all hard core gamers .	1
Games like Formula D are a perfect example of the importance of theme in a game . At a fundamental level , there is n't much of a difference between this game and Chutes and ladders . You roll a dice and you move . Of course there are things like different dice that correspond to the gears in a car , points that correspond to things like engine , brakes and tires that wear out as the race progresses . These are the things that mechanically make the game different . But the theme of being in a race with up to 9 friends is what makes it fun . We 've been racing each other since we could crawl so a race to the finish line is the most natural thing to anyone , even if they do n't play board games . A game takes less than an hour and rules can be explained in less than 10 minutes . The board has 2 sides that feature different tracks and has advanced rules once you want to bump the complexity a bit . A great game for groups or family but plays well with even a few players .	1
Playing board games has been my hobby for about 40 years . I began playing them when I discovered the bookcase games in the late 1960s . The intricate strategy games have always interested me , which is why this one intrigued me . It 's a well designed game that will appeal to just about anyone . The fact that they offer beginner and advanced rules will provide a rich playing experience for all levels of gamers . In the basic game , you shift gears to roll dice that allow for higher numbers and more spaces moved on each turn . Players have to slow down to allow for stopping a certain number of times in turns . Not slowing down enough will cause damage to your engine and damage points are taken away , so there is a small element of strategy even in the beginner 's game - not enough to make it difficult , but enough so that it 's not just roll and move . In the advanced game , the rules allow for a lot more strategy . You have to account for tire and engine wear , weather conditions , and much more . It 's a great strategy game for those who love that sort of experience . I played a lot of Strat-o-matic Baseball and Civilization , so I know what an intricate and rich strategy experience is like , and this game has it in spades . The artwork and components are really impressive and there are a ton of tracks that can be purchased , so the re-playability is endless . Leagues can also be made for true racing fans . This game is a re-release of another version called Formula De . It had a ton of tracks made for it and they all work with this version , so this opens a world of opportunities . This is a true classic !	1
One of my favourites in my collection , Very fun and has rules for all sorts of play , from beginner to advanced . Comes with two tracks , the second for a more mechanically advanced game .	1
This is the only car racing game you every need . It can be taught in minuets to new players . The game is at its heart a dice rolling game , so some of the decisions are out of your control but there is still enough strategy to make it feel like you are in control of your car . The extra tracks are a most , the Germany and Spain expansion are very good tracks . This is one of the few games that can play up to 10 players , which is super fun .	1
We & # 8217 ; ve only played three games , but it is fun . I like the simple concept of shifting to higher gears allowing the player to roll a higher-sided die and potentially go faster , coupled with the challenge of the corners where you must end your movement 1 , 2 or 3 turns to avoid damaging your car or crashing.The causes a lot of upshifting , downshifting and braking to meet the criteria to not crash , but if too much damage is done to a particular component such as tires or brakes , you could potentially crash and be out of the game.The game captures the feel of car racing without having to be a gear-head to enjoy it . I don & # 8217 ; t even like car racing , but enjoyed playing this game . The concept is easy to grasp and has a decent strategy to chance ratio . Play it too safe and you & # 8217 ; ll lose the race , but go too fast into a turn and you & # 8217 ; ll crash.Then there is the 'Danger Die ' . This is what Wil Wheaton called it in his review and I like the name , but let & # 8217 ; s face it & # 8211 ; it isn & # 8217 ; t that dangerous . Any time a car ends its movement next to another car , there is a risk of collision . The player must roll the d20 Danger Die , and if they roll a 1 , there is a collision and take damage . That & # 8217 ; s a 5 % chance of collision , so happens rarely . When it does occur it causes 1 body damage , which is not that big a dealDanger Die , indeed . More like , & # 8220 ; Mildly Concerning Die That Isn & # 8217 ; t Very Dangerous , & # 8221 ; but whatever.Honestly , I thought the game was fun and liked the choices I had to make each turn and the pace of the game is lighting fast . There are options to make pit stops to replace tires and such , making multiple lap games possible and increasing the risks.So , we & # 8217 ; ve only played two games with three players , but I & # 8217 ; d love to try this more players ( it plays up to 10 ! ) and more laps or the street racing rules , which have great options for characters and even police to start pursuing in the middle of a race . There are several expansions that include different tracks and I will be picking these up as I can . The game components are a lot of fun , too . I dig shifting gears on the little dashboard and when moving my car around the track , I can & # 8217 ; t help making car noises.All in all , this is a fast-playing , accessible game without a lot of intimidating rules . It even has a basic rules version ( which we skipped ) that make it simpler , still.I rank this game up there with games like Ticket to Ride , Catan or Roll Through the Ages . It & # 8217 ; s a great game to play with non-gamers and still fun for hardcore types . It & # 8217 ; s a worthwhile addition to any gamer & # 8217 ; s collection .	1
I own about 120 board/card games and Formula D is quickly becoming my favorite of all . I received Formula D for Christmas and have played it 5 or 6 times by myself today to get a good understanding of it before friends come over . ( Nothing kills the fun of an evening with friends like a 45 minute pause to read and understand instructions for a new game . ) My first impression was `` Wow this game 's design was well thought out '' . All the pieces that comprise the game are well made with a fair amount of attention to detail . The 2-sided board ( made to play F-1 races or illegal street races ) is huge , colorfully detailed , and thick . The tiny plastic cars ( 20 in all ) are well made and painted to match their corresponding cards . The dashboard cards ( 10 in all ) are double sided so that you can play basic or advanced rules . Best of all , the box is designed to hold it all nice and neatly in place . It even came with a few little zip lock bags to store all the little pieces.Next I tried to learn how to play . This is the only negative I have encountered with this product . There are several flaws in the newer 2013 version instructions . This is originally a French made game and as such some of the finer points of game play instructions were lost in translation . For example , the word `` treble '' is used in place of `` triple '' several times and the phrase `` While driving on a straight , a car may only change two lanes '' is just wrong . After reading and re-rereading the printed instructions I had a basic understanding of how the game is played but I still had several important questions unanswered . I recommend that you do what I did and get on online forums to find clarity on the instructions from people that have an understanding of how to play.After searching the internet for complete and logical English instructions I played the game . Man is it fun -- even when played by myself using two cars . ( When playing by myself I play one car strategically and conservative and I have the other car take more risks and test the limits . It 's fun to see which style wins each race and why . ) The game play is really fun and even though dice are used I find that the element of strategy in this game is strong enough to overcome the luck of a die role . It has a clever game mechanic and I really ca n't tell you enough how fun I find this game to be . I hope my friends enjoy it as much as I do because I 've read that some people actually have racing seasons with this game and it 's expansions . I could see how that would be really enjoyable . There are many positive attributes that I could go on to tell you about how this game is actually worth the money but I 'll just keep it simple and say buy it , you wo n't regret it . And if your a trustworthy , hygienic , non-smoking , nice , and respectful person in the Tulsa area come on over and play a few races with us .	1
This game I has seen played on a web series called Table TopSooooo glad that I did this game is ridiculously fun and great for the whole family , my kids and even my wife loved it.So if your looking for a great family game for game night then look no further..P.S . we do n't even like racing LOL	1
This is a perfect game : easy to learn for both the `` basic '' and `` advanced '' modes , fast to set up , really fun and very enjoyable for all family members.It is also very flexible in terms of game length , you can play a single lap in some 20 minutes , or can plan for a full racing season that may take a full day if you desire . Also it is very flexible in terms of number of players , as it can be 2-10 . I have even played it solo ( practice mode ? ) and even then is quite fun . You can also play with `` stock cars '' or can even make your custom ones.Worthily is to mention the top notch quality of all its components . I just wish the cars were bigger , but as it is the board is already big enough !	1
At least , it 's back . One of the most famous Formula One board games , out of print for such a long time , is finally published again.Formula D ( it 's the name now , instead of `` Formula De '' ) is a fast-pacing , easy to learn Formula One board game up to ten players ( the more , the best ) . By means of simple and yet amazingly intelligent game devices , you 'll feel in control of a racing car during a Grand Prix , experiencing all the thrills and pitfalls of such events.The desing aspect of the game is brathtaking . Gorgeous mapboard , rules books , miniature cars . In short , it 's highly recommend game if you 're into Formula One and board games.I 'd like to give my opinion of how FORMULA D stands against its main competition in Formula One board games , be it Avanlon Hill 's out of print SPEED CIRCUIT.I think SPEED CIRCUIT is the more authentic , realistic and `` personal '' : it is a harsh game , when players battle for racing lanes all the time . You have to not only to make your plot , you must almost ALL THE TIMES guess your opponent 's plot . Also , like real racing '' , there 's less opportunity to win if you 're starting from the back of the grid.FORMULA D , on the contrary is more `` user-friendly '' . It also envolves a lot of calculation , but is not so hard on players ( and on the brain ! ) and depends a lot of dice results . I think it 's a better game for people trying to just have fun , while Speed Circuit is better for people wanting to compete.Also , I hope extra tracks become available soon .	1
Formula D is a great party game that gets the entire room cheering . Even for the starter players , there is a set of basic rules that most can grasp very quickly . Every time I have played this game , I 've had a great time . I do not enjoy cars or racing but the excitement of this game really gets your adrenaline going.The game lends easy to advanced players who want to implement the advanced rule set that want to make the game far more complicated and even more exciting.With the amount of people that can play , this game is a great pick for people that want to start introducing people into unconventional board games . I highly recommend this for anyone that is looking for a game to include a large group of people .	1
I bought this game after seeing it on the Youtube show TableTop with Wil Wheaton. [ ... ] It took all of 10 minutes to learn the rules and my 11 year old picked it up just as fast . There are three levels of play , so you can break it out for any skill level . On the first time I took it to my game group , it was so popular that it filled up all 10 players . ( I had to bow out of my own game to make room for others ! ) The game is played with a special set of dice that determine how far the cars go around the track . It has tons of relpy value as each time you race the randomness of the dice really changes things . Also , on multiple times I 've seen the player in dead last , for most of the game , win the race . I enjoy that because it keeps everyone involved.The game pieces are small and not overly detailed , but still are very nice . One of the best parts in this updated version is the gearshift / damage board . In previous versions , it was just a piece of paper . Now you get an actual gearshift and peg board to enchnace gameplay . There are two race tracks in this set . However , you can buy more official tracks or go online and find free print & play tracks on Boardgamegeek . I ca n't say enough great things about this game.Link to Print & Play tracks : [ ... ] ( You 'll need an Boardgame geek account to follow the link )	1
Formula D is a re-make of the popular French racing gameFormula De . Though I never owned that game , I am told the two versions are very similar . The new version has a few minor rules changes and adds a street racing format as an alternative method of play . ( I have not tried the street racing format , yet , but will update my game review when I have done so . ) One of the things I like best about this game is its ability to accommodate up to 10 players . Very few board games can handle such a large group . In my opinion , the more players there are on the track , the more fun the game gets . The track can get a bit crowded and players can be more aggressive and take more chances that may negatively effect their own vehicle or the vehicles around them . This ups the competitive nature of the game , and with the right group of players , there 's sure to be plenty of trash-talking and friendly jibes.Each player chooses one of the tiny race cars to represent themselves . ( The cars are of varying body styles and paint jobs , so it 's not too hard to distinguish yourself from the other players . ) A die is rolled to determine each person 's starting position on the track . Each player is also assigned a `` gearbox . '' This gearbox is a small plastic tray that holds a small cardboard pegboard . On the pegboard is a small gearbox ( for gears 1-6 ) and a line of peg holes for each of the following attributes of your vehicle : tires , brakes , gearbox , car body , engine , and suspension . In the simplified version of the game , each player begins the game with identical car attributes . A plastic peg is placed in a numbered hole next to each car attribute , and a plastic stick-shift is placed in gear one of the gearbox . All players begin the game in gear one , and they roll the gear one die to see how far they can advance down the track . As rounds progress , players must state , aloud , whether they are going to upshift , downshift , or stay in the same gear . When they choose to upshift or downsift , they pick up the corresponding die for that gear . There are six dice - each one a different color and each one representing a specific gear . The higher geared dice have higher numbers on them , allowing for greater distances to be covered on a turn . For example , the numbers on the dice are as follows : Gear 1 ( yellow ) : 1-2Gear 2 ( orange ) : 2-4Gear 3 ( red ) : 5-8Gear 4 ( green ) : 7-12Gear 5 ( purple ) : 11-20Gear 6 ( blue ) : 21-30Straightaway portions of the track are easy to traverse , but the game is won and lost in the corners . You see , each corner requires you to stop a certain number of times . To make the required number of stops inside the corner , players must carefully plan out when to downshift so they do n't overshoot a corner and damage or destroy their car . Overshooting corners , emergency downshifting , and collisions with other cars all have a negative impact on a player 's vehicle . Each time their car is damaged , players must move the plastic peg of the damaged attribute on their pegboard towards the zero . When a specific attribute reaches zero , their car is generally destroyed and they are out of the race . Because it really is n't that hard to destroy your vehicle , players must plan out their track position and time their shifting carefully . Cars can be repaired ( though rarely fully ) at the end of each lap by making a pit stop.There is definitely more strategy involved in this game than what you might think just by looking at the cover of the box . To add an extra layer of strategy to the game ( and a bit of story ) , players can also choose to use the advanced rules . When using the advanced rules , players take on the role of a specific , named driver . Each of these drivers have a set of car attributes specific to them , and they each have a special ability that only they can use ( once per lap ) while driving . The road races also involve more road hazards and NO pit stops . Other options you may choose to employ in the game include weather conditions and team races . When I play this game with my children , I allow them to use two cars on their `` racing team . '' This allows them to play conservatively with one and aggressively with the other , and keeps them from being immediately eliminated from play should one of their cars get wrecked.This is a very solid game , both in terms of production and game play . It is most fun when you have an enthusiastic bunch of guys ( or girls ) to play with . If you get tired of racing the two tracks that come with this game , there are others that you can purchase separately in one of the expansion packs ( Formula D Expansion 1 : Sebring and Chicago , Formula D Expansion 2 : Hockenheim and Valencia , Formula D Expansion 3 : Docks and Singapore , Formula D : 04 Baltimore/India ) , though they are pretty expensive when you consider that all you are getting is a game board.This game has a small learning curve , but once you play through an entire game , most of the mechanics will be easily remembered for future play . The game map is quite large - made up of two separate fold-out cardboard sheets that are laid out side-by-side . As such , you will need a decently-sized gaming surface to play the game on . A small cardboard table is n't going to cut it ! This is a fun game that fans of racing will especially enjoy ! Highly recommended ! I will add more comments to my review after I have had the opportunity to try out the street racing portion of the game .	1
I really like this game . I played a home-made version in a science class when I was a kid 25 years ago , so when I learned of this one I had to get it . Actually , my brother had a copy and so I first played his before getting my own . Boardgamegeek.com has plenty of 'print-your-own ' tracks available that I keep meaning to try out .	1
We were looking for a lighter game to play with the kids over the heavier euro strategy games we prefer . Formula D is a reprint of the original Formula D & eacute ; . This version includes a street racing variant . Although I ca n't comment on that variant as I 've not played it.The game comes with a family , or basic , version of the rules and then a set of advanced rules . The basic rules are great for playing with younger kids , but the advanced rules are best for older kids and adults.The basic premise is to roll dice to make your car go and to get around the track first . However the strategy comes in when you approach turns and you must ensure you stop a certain number of times in each turn . This is also complicated by the fact that you are rolling different dice based on which gear you are currently in . The higher the gear the faster you go and the harder it is to stop the required number of times in each turn.Obviously there is a lot more to the game than my simple explanation , but overall this game is a very fun , light game that all people have enjoyed . Even those not into racing . The fact that it also supports 2-10 racers is great for family gatherings .	1
Pros : Educational value for kids is great , Beginner to advanced game play , Well themed game , 10 PLAYERS.Con : Cheap Plastic Container , High Luck Factor for dice rollFormula D Racing is a fun game . The racing theme fits the game perfectly . It offers both a beginner and advanced game experience . Literally , it comes with different sets of rules depending on how simple to complex you wish to make the game . The luck factor is high in game . The strategy is still good , as it requires you to use your cars resources wisely . And like real competition users must decided when they are will attempt to make their moves forcing others to respond . And honestly , a 10 player board game is unheard of ! I 've only played 8 , and each player does extend the game time , but still a plus to be able to add more players.Educational value for kids on this game would be in counting . It 's simple math , but they have to determine through addition and subtraction how much risk they care to take.My biggest disappointment with this game is the plastic they used for the container . Very cheap plastic . It cracked and tore the first 1 or 2 plays . The rest of the game pieces are quality.Still a great buy , and I would recommend this game .	1
This comes off as very similar to Cards Against Humanity or Apples to Apples , except that people are trying to guess what your original card was , instead of you having to select a favorite . The most interesting aspect comes from having to give enough of a clue to have at least one person guess it , but not have everyone guess it . Younger players may have a tougher time with this subtlety.Only thing I wish is that there were more cards in each set . Guess I need to buy more sets ( 86 cards each ) to stretch out the game play . This package has room to store additional cards , if extra sets are purchased .	1
This game is plain awesome.Essentially each person gets a term to describe something . Maybe a movie , mood , color , etc . Then each person selects from their cards to represent what was described . Then they are all laid out face up . The goal is to get at least one person to select your described card but not all of them . The cards are so varied and versatile that it leaves so much room for interpretation . My kids have a blast with this game however since they are 5 and 6 they sometimes try to make too specific description in which it is obvious in which their card is . The more people that play the better IMO . I would recommend at least 4 .	1
Dixit is the one game I own that nearly EVERY person will enjoy . The artwork on the cards is beautiful and the game is always competitive and unique . It has tons of replay value and there are expansions to add hours of more fun . This game is a must own in any family that enjoys board games .	1
A great family game of storytelling that will keep people amused and stimulate the imagination.The artwork is excellent and whimsical . The components are solid.This game board is a revised edition that goes up to 6 players . There are some improvements . The instructions are now pretty clear from box to board not really requiring combing into the rule book making it quite easy to jump in.There 's another version that goes up to 12 players , but all that people voting is overkill and hard to track . 6 is enough .	1
We bought 3 new games for family game nights : ) We saw episodes of Will Wheaton 's youtube show , TableTop and these 3 games looked like a lot of fun ( Munchkin and Forbidden Island were the other two ) . Out of the three , this is my favorite because it allows for expressive and creative word use : ) Phrases , a song , a tune , a movie or book title ... It is a good test for one 's knowledge , too ( which is good for my kid hehe ) ... We have had a lot of fun with this game - the art work is interesting and provides a decent challenge . I hope they make expansions for it !	1
This unique game requires one player on his turn to come up with a word or phrase which describes a picture in their hand . It could be one word , a phrase or a sentence . The other players pick a card from their hand which they think matches that word or phrase . The pictures are fanastical and engaging . Selected cards are mixed and placed face up on he table . Players then vote on which picture they believe was the one who spoke the word or phrase . Points are awarded accordingly . The player who chose the word wants at least one person to pick their card , but not everyone . I highly recommend this game !	1
Great game to play with very large groups . Love the need for creativity in this game . Wish there were more & # 34 ; picture cards & # 34 ; , but I guess that 's the reason why I they expansion packs and stuff . Very fun !	1
We really like this game for family game night . My daughter asks to play it over and over . I also own Dixit : Journey and have folded the two games together , but mostly I like the cards and the components to this game better . This is a great game for kids that allows them to expand their imagination , and also fun for adults to come up with creative ways to describe cards that kids will understand . Really fun , and I saw this on Wil Wheaton 's Tabletop show and knew we would love it . Great addition to family game night .	1
This game gets you thing creatively . It lots of fun to play with family and friends . Easy to play right out of box .	1
I bought this game after watching it played on the youtube show Table Top . The core idea for the game is simple and yet brilliant . Use abstract art combined with your imagination to try and stump most of you audience , but not everyone ! The best part is that even when it 's not 'your turn ' you are participating . That 's what makes this such a fantastic party game . Nobody is just siting around waiting , like in just about every other board game.I tried playing it with three of my friends ( we 're all thiry-ish ) for a total of four players , and the game was ok . But I think four is the WORST number of people to play it at . When I played it with my family ( all ages ) for a total of six players , we all had a BLAST ! I think five would be similarly fun . I also think a large part of the fun was the specific people . My friends are much more into strategy and trivia games , with the occasional Cards Against Humanity shock-and-laugh game thrown in . This game did n't do it for them . My family is much more laid back and we all think in obscure ways . This all came together to form the perfect gaming group for Dixit.With three , there 's an interesting mechanic in which the 'not-it ' players can put in two 'distraction ' cards , instead of the usual one . It just seems like with 4 people ( who are n't too imaginative ) , the game can be dull . Go with 6 and you 're all good !	1
My only negative is that the picture cards are too thin.Really great game to play while learning to finesse that line between too specific and too general in the clues one gives . The object is to have at least one other player identify your card from your clue , but not all . Other players strive to play a card that garners votes while choosing the clue-giver 's card themselves .	1
It 's a bit difficult for my 7 year old but not for my 9 year old . Great for creativity , imagination , fun . There are so many things on each card that the replay value is there ... Card art is beautiful . It plays pretty well with 3 people but I 'd recommend it for 4+	1
I had this game recommend to me and purchased it hoping that I would enjoy it . I must say that it is an excellent game . It is a little like Apples to Apples , but with pictures instead of words . You can be endlessly creative with this game . It is great for a variety of ages and can be easily enjoyed . It is really fast to learn , but can take a way to understand all of the subtle strategy to the game . I would definitely recommend it to other people . Great game for all ages !	1
I first played this among a Gaming Group I play with once a week , not long after it was one of the favorite `` board '' games among the other gamers at the Game & Hobby shop where we all play . Although it says 8+ , my 7 year old daughter also took to it right away and it has since become her favorite game.What I love about this game is it 's a quick and simple play and for anyone and everyone . The set up is easy , deal six cards to up to six players , everyone picks a color ( to represent them via Bunny on the score board and voting chips ) and you pick someone to start . They pick a card from their hand , for example let 's say Player 1 chooses a card with a Bunny on it and two doors before him , one red . This scene could remind the player of The Matrix ( one commonly used with this card among our group ) , Alice in Wonderland ( because of the white rabbit ) , Doors , Doorway or Entrance ( because of the doors , obviously ) or even Bunny or Rabbit ( for the younger players , there are more rabbits in different decks ) .Once he chooses his card , he says something that reminds him ( like the above mentioned ) , let 's say he chooses Alice in Wonderland as his phrase . The other players then pick a card from their hand , without revealing , that reminds them of Alice in Wonderland . Let 's say Player 2 has a card with a cat on it somewhere that reminds him of the Cheshire Cat , so he plays this . Player 3 has a card that shows several cards stacked , the top having a Red Queen on it , reminding him of the Red Queen in Alice in Wonderland . So he plays this . Player 4 has nothing that represents the clue so he simply plays a card he wants to get rid of.Then all the cards are shuffled up so nobody knows who played what , then revealed on numbers 1-4 ( or however many characters are playing ) . Then each player looks at the cards and chooses which they think the first player played ( not nessasarily which they think is most like the clue , but which they think that player most likely played ) This game comes in handy when you play with people you know very well as you can anticipate what they chose sometimes based on their clues , their cards and who they are as a person . This makes the play funner sometimes and also challenges players to be more abstract with their clues.Each player votes anonymously , vote card face down , for which card they think PLayer 1 played . Once all votes are cast they are revealed.If everyone picked then right card , everyone but Player 1 gets 2 points ( penalizing Player 1 by being too obvious with their card or simply nobody else had a card that also represents the clue ) . Bunnies are moved up according to points.If at least one person voted for another card , then the players voting correctly AS WELL AS Player 1 all receive 3 points.The Player whose card was chosen also receives an extra point . They receive as many points as there are votes for their card , and those who wrongly chose their card receive none.If nobody chooses the correct card , everybody but Player 1 receives 2 points ( again penalizing Player 1 but this time for not being obvious enough ) . They also receive 1 point for everyone who votes for their card.The player who chooses a card this turn obviously does not vote as they already know the chosen card . You also may not vote on your own card at any time.It 's a very simple rule set up which goes quickly as points are quickly earned and everyone 's bunny races to the end.There is also a different set of gameplay for if you are playing with only 3 people , making it harder to narrow down the few cards by having opponets play two cards instead of one , providing 5 choices instead of 3 in a 3 player game.Definitley Highly Recommended , you 'll be buying expansion cards as soon as you fall in love with this game , too . I 've already purchased two myself . A must have for any gamer no matter what level or type of games you love , this truly is one for everyone . Simple and Great fun !	1
great , great , great , party game ! easily accommodates more than 6 ; you just have to make your own voting tiles . SO fun . and FUNNY ! creative people LOVE this game . however , if you buy this game , I HIGHLY recommend getting several expansions . 84 cards seems like a lot , but after just a few games of it , we 're left desiring more variety in cards . the dixit box is genius : it comes with THREE places for expansions . after we ordered this game and loved it , we order 3 of the expansions , and the box will be able to hold all the cards . get this . you wo n't regret it .	1
Dang , where can I order prints of the card art ? ! This game is really beautiful , not just visually , but in gameplay as well . Very well balanced and encourages creativity . Absolutely safe for all ages .	1
I 'm not a huge fan of this game but the rest of the family love it . Some times you have to be very creative , having inside knowledge of the people your playing with can be a real advantage . It 's amazing what some people dream up when playing this game . Very easy and casual gaming for the family	1
The mechanic is familiar , picking out someone 's card but Dixit adds a little twist and still manages to be fun . In Dixit , on a player 's turn , he/she tries to convince others to pick his/her card through clues . Easy , except the player do not want everyone to pick it , just some . That player gives a clue , puts down a card , all others , pick a card from their hand and puts down a card , trying to get their cards picked so they can get points . It 's a easy game in theory , but in practice , the cards themselves are sometimes not easy to give clues for , plus one may see the `` clue '' in multiple cards presented . Dixit is a wonderful light and enjoyable game , no pressure , no deep brain draining thought process required . Despite that , Dixit still makes you think about connecting the clue to the picture . Great for children and adults , the kids may not `` get '' it but the fact that they can play along and not feel left out is a giant step in the right direction.Please click YES if my review have been helpful to you , it will encourage me to continue writing and updating my reviews , and leave a comment if you have any questions , I will be more than happy to answer if I can be of help .	1
First , the cards are amazingly beautiful . I mean just look at them - they 're the kind of cards that make you want to think of stories or at the very least wonder if this is n't some sort of personality test . They feature some very strange images and some wistful ones and overall they 're just gorgeous . And every single expansion of the game pretty much just gives you even more cards to play with.But the cards are just a series of visual pegs - story starters that the storyteller and eventually the players will use as inspiration to find the right card and clue that will score the most points . And this is where your knowledge of the other players can really come into play - as a storyteller you only need one person to guess your card right . Everyone else can wander around at will . And thus if there 's a reference only the two of you can get , then this may be a viable strategy.However as you increase the number of players , you 'll realize that one can actually score more points when you 're not the storyteller by stealing votes . A well-played card means snagging more points in your direction and if you 're lucky you 'll deny the storyteller as well . And so when you play this game between friends and family , you 'll find that your & # 34 ; strategy & # 34 ; may shift based on who 's at the table.And despite the random nature of the cards that you 'll draw , stealing points is n't necessarily that difficult . A popular clue that comes up in our games is & # 34 ; Pixar & # 34 ; , and the nature of the images can connect to quite a number of Pixar animated movies . We 've even had games with people as themes such as a birthday game with all the clues related to different aspects of and stories about the birthday celebrant.If you have the original version of the game , then you also get to enjoy the somewhat idyllic notion of these little wooden rabbit tokens traveling around this part of the forest - which is what the board is meant to look like . The current version of the game provides a simpler board , more spaces to store cards and a rather large visual reminder of how the scoring rules work.Dixit is a game that is elegant in its simplicity and quite the wonderful experience to share . We 've used this game to get quite a number of people excited to join one of our game nights , especially for newer players .	1
Unique game . Kids love it . It 's a bad name for the game though because my 8 year old boy has to repeat the name of the game with emphasis on the Dix part until I tell him to stop . The way you play the game is describing a card but not too well . Describe your card too well and you get no points , not well enough and you get no points . Has to be in the middle if that makes sense . Pictures are weird and strange depictions of surreal scenes .	1
I love these Dixit games . It 's like a cross between Apples to Apples and Say Anything . We get together as family and friends quite frequently for game night and this game was a big hit . I now have all the Dixit variety cards . Fun fun game for all ages .	1
This is such a creative and fun game . My 7 year old loves it too . The only down side is that only 6 players can play at a time . Teams do n't really work . A party version would be a nice addition to the series	1
Pixit is the graphic version of apple to apple if you never played the originalDixit . The idea is you try to guess other people interpretation of what the `` word '' or `` term '' is via a picture card you use.The differences between the original Pixit and Odyssey.+up to 12 players now verse 6 , so 6 more wooden bunnies.+scare card is used now . You place a pin on the score card rather then place your old chip number on the board.+scoring board changed too . You do n't go in circle on the board no more . There is a linear track now , flip out board.+The box is better design , you can add expansion pack or the old dixit card in it and it will fit . Space was limited on the orginal.-the art design is worst then the original . I had the chance to pick the odyssey or original , I bought the original . Even with the design scoring improvement I thought the new card graphic was n't as artist and simple . Just too much going on.I just could n't buy this version because I like the artist of the original and got that one . If you never played any Pixit before , just get this one . Better layout and more people can play .	1
it 's great that it supports more people to join this ice breaking game . i would recommend this to people that enjoys the base game .	1
My daughter and her husband asked for this for Christmas . They had played it at a party and had really enjoyed it	1
It takes a bit to learn this one , but once you get the hang of it , this game is so much fun . 4-6 players is best .	1
I 'm a proud owner of the originalDixitandDixit 2 Expansion Setgames . My family plays a lot of games , and we really enjoy sharing new games with family and friends . Last year , Dixit was the new game we were sharing with everyone , and everyone loved it . The only thing that could have been approved upon ( in the original ) would have been the ability to play with more players . Well , with Dixit Odyssey that minor issue has been resolved . With the addition of a whole new stack of cards ( assuming you have the original two Dixit games , which you WILL want ! ) , a newly-designed box that holds ALL of your existing cards , and the ability to include 12 players , this new Dixit is a real crowd-pleaser ! If you have ever playedApples to Apples Party Box - The Game of Hilarious Comparisons , you 're going to be a bit familiar with the style of game play that this game presents . Unlike that game , however , there is no reading involved . Instead of comparing words , you 're only comparing pictures . The game is easy to learn and easy to teach . Play it one time and you wo n't have to refer to the directions any more . Highest possible recommendation for this game ! If you are `` artsy '' or a naturally creative person , you will especially love this game ! Best game to come along in years , and accessible to a wide range of ages !	1
Dixit is a great game and why not get the Odyssey edition in case you end up inviting 12 people over for a game night one time ? If I had to describe this unusually fun game , it 's like 'Apples to Apples ' with pictures = ) .	1
Dixit is a fantastic party game somewhere between Balderdash and Apples to Apples , but with it 's own style and flair . The `` storyteller '' for the round chooses a card from his hand and , without showing it to anyone else , says a word or phrase he thinks suits the card . Everyone than choses a card from their hand that they think matches what was said . All cards ( including the storyteller 's ) are shuffled randomly and then everyone votes on which card they think is the storyteller's.The genius behind the mechanics is the storyteller only scores points if at least one , but not all , of the other players picks correctly . This forces the storyteller to avoid being too vague or too specific.The card images themselves are wonderfully evocative and unique , prompting creativity in choosing `` stories '' for them . The fact that the game boils down to a simple premise of `` describe the picture on the card '' makes it perfect to play with kids . I have n't played with a particularly small group yet , but it has played extremely well for us with groups ranging from 5 to 9 and players ages 7 to 45.Odyssey is a stand alone addition , but is fully compatible with the first two releases ( and the box is even designed to hold the cards from the previous sets ) .Games that encourage creativity and enhance language skills while being fun for any person big or small that chooses to join in are rare . This is a great addition to anyone 's game closet.Highly recommended .	1
The Most Beautiful of Card Games ? Seldom does a board games graphics move one 's heart and soul . Sure , we remember the games from our childhood with nostalgia -- Candyland , anyone ? And games are often interesting and stimulating . But how often are games truly beautiful ? So here 's how it works : One player is storyteller for a turn . He draws 6 cards -- each with an image . He selects one image and gives a clue about it . It could be a sentence , a story , a sound , a song , a gesture , a drawing . Anything . The rules give no restrictions to the clue.The other players must look at the images in their own hands and guess which the storyteller chose . They each hand the card representing their guess to the storyteller . He shuffles them and lays them out . All players then bet on which card belonged to the storyteller.However , the storyteller does not want everyone to guess which card/image he chose . If EVERYBODY gets it right , or if NOBODY does , he scores no points . But if SOME get it write and SOME get it wrong , then he earns points . Players who guessed correctly also score points.This edition makes it easier for larger groups to play . It also provides some new images and gives you space to store the cards from other sets , too.Again , the beauty of this game is remarkable . The images are fantastical , dreamlike , surrealistic . Which all lends to an atmosphere of mystery , expectation , and the unknown . It is only rivaled in beauty by certain Tarot decks ( though these images contain no occult symbolism ) and perhaps by certain handmade board games . Highly recommended for those who tire easily of the strict rules of other games.Also check out the originalDixitandDixit 2 .

This is a hit with everyone I play it with . I have combined it with Inventions and between the two decks , there is plenty of cards . I am not a fan of the tin they use to store the games . At least you can fit two sets into one tin if you remove the insert .	1
This is another solid installment in the Timeline series of card games . I own all of the sets , and as always , the artwork is fantastic , and the gameplay is simplistic and fun , stimulating plenty of good conversation and noggin scratching ( and plenty of referencing Wikipedia to confirm answers ! ) .What 's really cool about these games is that anybody can play them , even younger kids , because all you 're doing is arranging the cards in chronological order . Though a lot of kids will not be familiar with the events/inventions/discoveries ( and let 's face it - a lot of you adults wo n't be , either ! ) , it 's a great way for people to learn and ask questions . It really stimulates good , thought provoking conversation among the players . And in a pinch , you can even play it by yourself , solitaire style ! If you find that you 're becoming too familiar with the cards , and the game is becoming a shade too & # 34 ; easy & # 34 ; , there is a quick solution - just add this deck to other Timeline decks , and watch the difficulty spike ! It 's also worth noting that this game comes in an attractive , super durable tin with excellent artwork . The interior of the tin is intelligently designed so as to keep the cards tightly held in place and protected when not in use . The artwork on the cards themselves is also outstanding , and it further stimulates the imagination and the deduction process as you try to ascertain what year the card occurred in . This level of detail is not seen in many games , and it 's greatly appreciated . For $ 15 or less , you ca n't go wrong , and it also makes a fantastic , unconventional gift . You can literally learn how to play this game in less than three minutes , and from there , it 's straight to the fun with friends and family . Just try it ... you wo n't be disappointed !	1
My family loves Brain Quest , but this turns asking simple questions about dates and events into a game that is fun to play . What is the difference between the Discoveries game and the `` original '' Timeline - the `` original '' Timeline is actually the `` Inventions '' edition . This centers around discoveries.What discoveries ? To name a few , `` Pygmies - by Europeans , '' Halley 's Comet , '' `` Neptune , '' `` the speed of light , '' electrical heat reanimation , '' the structure of D.N.A. , '' etc.For those unfamiliar with the Timeline series , it is based on cards which you arrange in a chronological timeline with friends/family . The game mechanics are super easy , and it 's highly addictive . The cards are small , about half the size of a deck of standard cards , and each game comes with 100 of them . Additional currently available games include `` Timeline : Historical Events , '' `` Timeline : Diversity Game '' and `` Timeline Card Game ( Inventions ) . '' They are interchangeable , and it appears `` Monuments , '' `` Arts and Literature , '' `` Music , '' and `` Sports '' are soon to follow.Every individual who I have played this game with has loved it . It has become an instant classic in my family , and friends have gone out and bought it after playing . It is simple , quick , and fun . I will say though , that the 15 minute game time estimation pre-supposes people who make fast decisions . It can go as long as 30 minutes.Recommend.NB . The default game you find when you search `` Timeline '' on Amazon is actually the `` Inventions '' version . *A word to individuals who view science as being inconsistent with their beliefs . While you may find a few of the cards objectionable , I still find these to be of educational benefit - in settings such as school or homeschooling . This game invites conversation , from the one I had with friends `` that 's the date for the first soccer game , I wonder how they decided that . I thought they might have used the ancient Native Americans ' game '' to `` Honey , you might hear from other people that the earth materialized on x date , but we believe it was created on y date , and here is why .

Waaaaay overpriced for what you get . Daughter wants it but I think she will be disappointed . Content is very thin despite bulky cover .	-1
A crappy cardboard ghost of the original . Hard to believe they did this , but they did . Shame on Hasbro . Disgusting .	-1
not that great a game . have only played like once or twice and do n't even know where it is now .	-1
We have this same game but it was made in 1967 , we just thought the newer version would be more up with the times but we like the old one much better ! ! This one the tiles are cardboard and the little stand to put your pieces on is also made of very cheap cardboard ! ! We just gave this game a way and kept our old one ! !	-1
I just had the opportunity to play the Dungeons and Dragons Castle Ravenloft game , and I have to say that I am disappointed . Reviews I have read implied that the game was somewhat of a cross between D & D ; 4th edition and Betrayal at House on the Hill ( an excellent cooperative game with multiple scenarios ) . I really wanted to like this game . Though not a fan of D & D ; 4th edition , I did consider that ruleset would make a great boardgame . Sadly , I found this game to be severely lacking.The way the game is structured , you have a scenario with a win condition known at the start of the game ( the sessions I played were an escort mission , and a quest to kill a dracolich ) . Players then take turns moving and exploring , with player turns working much like D & D ; turns . The exploration system is my primary problem with the game . You go to the edge of the board , and lay down a random tile . Every tile has a monster , and every monster immediately attacks the character . There is no opportunity for reaction , tactics , etc . There are several reasons why this is problematic.D & D ; characters have strengths and weaknesses . Take , for example , the wizard . A wizard 's strength is being able to attacks enemies from afar , often multiple ones . Their weakness is typically lack of ability to take damage , represented by a low hit point total . Castle Ravenloft 's Exploration/Encounter system heavily penalizes the wizard character for having fewer hit points than the other characters . We came to realize that this character was just not viable for playing.Another weakness is the Exploration/Encounter system , as I mentioned before . Every exploration reveals an enemy . And while it is nice that all players cooperate , the tactics they use largely make them feel the same.Another game that occupies this same conceptual space is Descent . Also a dungeon crawl game , Descent has one player operate as the Overlord , controlling the monsters . Its gameplay is smoother and more satisfying , but it does not play so quickly . A better horror exploration game that plays in a similar amount of time is Betrayal at House on the Hill ( mentioned earlier ) . Primarily cooperative , it uses a traitor mechanic that causes one player to unexpectedly betray the party , which sets into motion a story-driven scenario , where both the traitor and the rest of the players have distinct win conditions.To sum up , this is not a good game . There are planty of other good cooperative games to measure this against . The poorly-conceived systems diminish its playability , and its small number of scenarios limit its replayability . I would seriously consider either of the games previously mentioned above this .	-1
Hated this product.Predictable . Not fun . It attempts to be a fast setup table top game but feels as a meshed together mess of crap . Often times I thought & # 34 ; this seems like d & d ; battle ... . Just kidding & # 34 ; . We never played it again after one play through.Would not recommend this for an older gaming group that enjoys board/card ga , es like talisman and 7 wonders and ascension.F	-1
I had high hopes for this game , as I am a big fan of Fourth Edition D & D ; ( though if you like 3e , enjoy it ! I 'm not going to tell you one is better ; I 'll just tell you which one I prefer ) . I also enjoy games with modular tiles and such , so I really went into this game biased towards enjoying it.Sadly , all that could n't rescue this game . It is exceedingly repetitive . Play about 3 turns and you 'll get the entire experience this game has to offer - there will be nothing new or exciting for you . The game is hopelessly shallow , based on so much chance that strategy is non-existent . Despite the modular tiles , the game offers virtually no customization.The pieces seem to be well-made , and fortunately it might supply some use for actual D & D ; , since the store I bought it from does n't do returns . However , the quality of the pieces is not matched by the game itself.I really wanted to enjoy this game , so I played 5 whole games and an uncounted number of aborted attempts , before accepting the fact that it simply does n't work . Extremely disappointing .	-1
The quality of the pieces is really nice.But there is little interaction between the players and there is n't any rhyme or reason to the difficulties of the monsters and no way to improve your characters . So if you are just interested in a luck-fest , this is the game for you .	-1
I am devasted ! ! Got this for Christmas for a grandchild just received it and the box it completely ripped in back ! ! ! NOW what I am not rating for the puzzle but for the packaging ! Will you replace it or send a new one ... ... ... .	-1
thought this was a book with pages to illustrate for my 7 yr old son but no it is loose pieces of white paper with no binder to put together a book . very disappointing	-1
Started out as a great road trip activity for my 5 yro but after the 2 yro used it , it became a mess . The stix became stuck together or had hairs stuck to them . It does n't come with a reusable bag or anything so they are all stuck in a big ball to the top of the book right now - neither my kids nor I want to deal with organizing them .	-1
I thought there would be dashed lines or something to show where to add stuff in the book , but basically it 's just a picture book that you could stick stuff to . In addition , it did n't come with very many stix .	-1
I got this game as a present and the reaction was not so great even after playing it..too much luck involved	-1
I would love to give this a higher review . It seems like such a great concept and I was so excited to get it for my son . But the battery died 2 days after we got it and of course it takes a small expensive specialty battery . Not impressed .	-1
It did n't work when we bought it , a bummer because it was for our 8 year old son 's birthday and he loves to read & keep track of the time he reads for school .	-1
We got this as a gift recently . At first glance it sounded like a good idea , until I read the story.1 . The elf `` watches '' your kids and then tattletales on them to Santa . Really ? We teach our children not to tattletale . I do n't like the idea of anything , real or imaginary being a dedicated tattletale.2 . Religion . The elf makes sure you do your prayers . This is a non starter , we are not a religious family , so this book is basically written for Christians , but that seems to be the theme for the whole book.3 . Santa is a bad enough idea ( he is not `` real '' in our family , just a mythical figure for fun , like Frosty ) . But this elf is a tangible object and he is supposed to fly back to Santa every night and tattletale on your kids . This is insulting my myself and my kids.This story is basically just a reinforcement of the Santa mythos , `` do good or else you get no toys '' . I teach my kids to do good for good sake and the golden rule . I do n't want them to think they have to pretend to be good just for a reward or because some magic person is watching them . 'Be careful the elf , Santa or god ( s ) are watching you ! 'is a horrible thing to teach kids.The best fun we had with the elf was the fact that is is freaky looking and my four year old is scared to death of it in a Chucky sort of way . So we beat it up and play fetch with it with the dog just to make her laugh and not to fear it . After the holiday season I think I will just toss the elf in the garbage and donate the book.So in short , want to instill fear into your children , buy this product . Otherwise respect their intelligence and invent something new - not just the repackaged Santa story . I 'm sure the inventors have made millions on this crap , do n't add to it .	-1
Here 's a creepy little elf and a book . If you want the elf to cook and buy all the accessories its like buying skylanders or Disney xfinity . Every little extra thing costs at least 20.00 . This is awful quality too . I would not recommend thistle anyone . Save your money and buy a nice advent calendar instead - I suggest a LEGO advent calendar !	-1
My Grandson got this and because of the movie , he got this one , but all my Great Grands got one cheaper and IMHO better because the arms and legs were wire and extremely posable . However , my Grandson ( 9 yrs old ) loved this elf and his Momand Dad had fun using the concept during the Holidays .	-1
I Love the idea of this but did n't like the story . We will do the elf with our own version of the story without the naughty or nice aspect . I am not comfortable telling my child that santa will not come if he is & # 34 ; naughty & # 34 ; . We will encourage striving for the & # 34 ; nice & # 34 ; behavior without threats . Is there really any parent out there who would actaully follow through with withholding presents in the case of undesirable behavior ? I really hope not so why make the threat . Think intrinsic motivation not extrinsic ...	-1
I was super excited to open up my Party Gras game at my party . I thought it would be a lot of fun but it was a little too simple to keep people interested . The entire premise of the game is you all start off with the same amount of beads and you pick a task from a limited amount of cards to try to get other people to do . If they do the task then you get their beads . There are not a lot of cards so if you want repetitive play it wo n't last long because you will have the advantage over everyone else because you will know all of the cards . Many of the tasks are really simple and does not keep your attention so it gets boring really quickly . Also you must have 4 players to play this game so if you have a small family and just want to play it will not work.This game is fun for a little but I think it is more suited to be an icebreaker game for people who want to get to know each other .	-1
This game looked like fun but after trying it , I quickly lost interest . I like board games but this one was not my taste . It had too many parts and a bit complicated to play . I suppose if you love Mardi Gras with a passion , then you may like the game . At this time of writing my review it ranked 171,212 of games and toys . I would not suggest buying Party Gras unless you are a real Mardi Gras person or having a theme party . The target audience for this game is low . I give it a do n't buy at any price.I rarely give a One Star on any review , but this is not what I expected . I ca n't say anything good about it and I do n't recommend this game .	-1
When I broke out Party Gras for the first time , it seemed like it could be a fun addition to a party . Just as quickly , people did n't care about the game and it broke up the flow.The `` game '' is simple , you try to do tasks on cards and when you do , you get more Mardi Gras style beads . Sadly , the game does n't function as a game on its own and when combined with other games or a party , it simply becomes a hassle . Essentially there will be one person really into it , going around collecting beads while ruining everyone else 's attempt to enjoy the party.It is a fine idea in theory , but the reality of playing it is rather painful .	-1
It took forever for me to write this review simply because you have to have a minimum of four people in order to play it . I intially tried to make it work with just two people that is simply not possible with this game . Fortunately the holidays rolled around and we had enough people stop by the house to make the attempt . I must emphasis the word attempt because after 5 minutes of explaining the `` rules '' no one was really engaged in the `` play '' aspect . I think this game is much more well-suited for people who do not know each other well in an `` icebreaker '' /conference setting . There was much rolling-of-the-eyes and are you kidding me ? responses from those who were gamely trying to make this work . It was quite frankly , not that much fun . As I mentioned previously , this would be a great game to use as an icebreaker for facillitators . I belive that would make this game much more of a `` party '' .	-1
I so wanted to love this game . I 'm a massive fan of the series and the movies as well . And I saw so many good reviews that I did n't hesitate to buy this game . Unfortunately I 'm not sure what all the five star reviews are for . Maybe because the game is so thematically beautiful . It really is . Oh well , let 's get to breaking it all down.Theme : 5 Stars . They 100 % nailed the theme here . All of the , & # 34 ; oh yeah ! I remember that episode ! & # 34 ; moments are here . And it 's fun to relive them . Also they balanced the characters very well . Mal is great at fighting challenges and even can hold his own when it comes to persuasion . Also I love the way they handled companions in the game too . Very well designed ! Mechanics : 4 stars . This is a solid hit too . They have different decks you buy from when you head to a certain place , like Silverhold or Athens . Also there are different job givers ( good old Badger ) spread across the board as well . Do legal jobs , and you do n't incur any danger . But you also make almost no money . Do illegal or immoral jobs for a high payout ! Also there are two decks you have to flip cards from when you are flying in either Alliance or Border space . Good mechanic because it allows for all the danger of navigating the black to show through.Gameplay : 0 Stars . And here is where the game comes to a 'monkeys must be loose in the engine room ' halt . The designers say the game is sandbox style . Go anywhere . Do anything you want . Sure . And loose while other people just do the exact strategy to win . First game we played , I was surprised at how few turns it took for someone to win the game . He got 3 delivery jobs . Did some muck work , and paid Niska . Wham , bam , thank you maam . Kiss your dear fluffy lord goodbye . Ok , maybe that was a fluke . Game 2 . Almost the same results . But this time with a different player . We even tried to stop him . I flew around in border space till I could get the Reavers on the Hunt card so another buddy of mine could intercept him . Yeah , crew dead , he does n't care . Still pays Niska and wins . Ugh.So maybe that was just a coincidence . We get together another time and play one of the other box scenarios . And I learn how to break the game and win every time . Do you want to know how to do it ? Seriously , in the next couple sentences I will spoil the game for you , and give you the secret to winning . Are you sure you want to know ? Yes ? Yes ? SPOILER ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! Go to either Badger or Amnon Duul and consider jobs , do crap work ( collect $ 200 ) till you get three either delivery jobs , or low misbehave jobs ( 1 card or 2 at the most ! ) . Go hire some crew ( Silverhold is a pretty good place ) . Complete the jobs . Repeat ad nauseam . Lame . But there you go . And yes it does work . Since I discovered that strategy I HAVE N'T LOST A GAME ! And I played with new and seasoned players . That is the biggest letdown in the world.Also some of our other players were really frustrated by the fact that all it takes is one lousy card to completely wreck your game . Hit the card that draws the Reaver or Alliance ship to you , and by the draw of one stupid card you can straight up loose ! Another annoyance , Niska jobs suck ! Sure they pay a lot . But they take a very varied skill set crew or you wo n't be able to beat all the misbehave cards you will have to draw . Also you do n't make that much more in the long run . Doing the slightly lesser but way less risk jobs is the way to go.I know this review will probably garner me a lot of down votes . But I do n't care . I 'm a huge gamer through and through and I hope to warn other people to avoid this game . Thematically it is brilliant and beautiful . But in the play , it is way less than shiney . I have boxed this game and will move on to other bigger and better games.But to leave the review on a positive note , I will leave you with some words of wisdom from captain Mal : You can learn all the math in the 'verse ... but you take a boat in the air that you do n't love ... she 'll shake you off just as sure as the turn of the worlds . Love keeps her in the air when she ought to fall down ... tells you she 's hurting before she keels . Makes her a home . ( Browncoats forever )	-1
I do n't get it- you have to carry around the board and the pen ... what is the difference between this and simply bringing a pen and pad of paper ? I was disappointed . After reading all of the great reviews , I guess I expected something special ! We played it a few times when we first got it , but since then it has been sitting untouched ( for about six months ) . However , we frequently play the `` old-fashioned '' hangman in waiting rooms , restaurants , etc . ... when it just is n't convenient to carry around the board . Overall , a waste of money !	-1
My granddaughter Abigail had to have the new Abby Cadabby doll . She 's very well put together for my two year old to carry around every where she goes . We both love her .	-1
This game is fun at first , but the gameplay is too simple to hold your interest for long , some cards ( especially some of the newer cards in the expansions ) are wayyy too powerful , and you will find yourself falling into a tedious rhythm of back-and-forth ganging up on whomever is currently in the lead . Do not , I repeat , do NOT buy any of the expansions until you 're absolutely sure you 're in love with this game and want to keep playing it for years . They do n't add much to the game and will require that you carefully trim your deck down to something manageable , as having a huge stack of door and treasure cards means that you wo n't even go through the deck once during a single game ( something which is part of the flavor when you only have the original deck ) .	-1
I know I 'll be lambasted by the game 's rabid followers for this , but to be honest this game looks simple but it 's really convoluted for a card game . It just does n't move fluidly and while its fans will rave about its mechanics , it 's actually very unbalanced and wonky . While the cards will make you smile it 's not the `` laugh riot '' some have claimed . It can have it 's moments ( so 2 stars ) but its generally frustrating and not fun , especially when compared to a far superior card game like Dominion , Gloom , or yes even Magic where things move fluidly and fun is had . Also while not part of my score , I 'm also not a fan of the game 's art . I understand that it 's supposed to look slapstick , but it 's also kind of a cop out . Some effort could have been put into it and still creating a fun feel .	-1
Especially if you have a ton of expansions . I can see this being your first expansion and it being really fun ; but I 've got all of them and it just makes it more confusing . Which is hard because I 'm the only one who knows all the rules .	-1
I thought my one year old would be super into this , he loves sticking things into slots . However he is barely interested in it . Partly because someone has to hold down the flimsy foam bottom while putting them in . And you have to push them in really hard into the foam to get them to stay , which he still can hardly do at almost 2 . Then you still have to push fairly hard to put them on top of each other , though they still stand up somewhat if you do n't click them in all the way . We are disappointed as there were many of these types of things to choose from and I am sure some of the others are better . And they are definitely overpriced .	-1
This book contains lead ! Do not give it to your little ones ! I read that in the customer reviews on Little Hands Love book and googled it and this book has lead , too	-1
I had this done with my girls and a few days . Wish they would make a thicker book like they do with there phonics . This workbook has very few worksheets in it so just letting people know . I would not waste my money on it .	-1
A very macabre game with an interesting premise and unique implementation . The transparent cards have great novelty value , but the fact that they all look alike from a distance makes it really tough to tell if someone is correctly following the rules ( some cards say & # 34 ; you ca n't do or must do certain things if this card is on top of one of your people & # 34 ; ) , and the lack of differentiation makes it really easy for you to forget both positive and negative effects of the cards currently in play on the family directly in front of you ! If you tell a narrative as you 're playing it helps a bit with engagement , but I feel that some of the effect cards are simply way too powerful . It 's too easy for a lucky draw to completely turn the tide of the game .	-1
So my boyfriend and I are pretty snobby about our games . And Gloom did n't really pass muster despite good recs . We played with 4 people ( but we played will the full families , which was a mistake ) and our game just kept going on forever . The instructions are not very clear . The fact that all your strategy can be wiped away with a single blow of a single card from someone else is annoying.We felt like we were missing a good deal of cards , though when we realized the instructions suggested that with 4 players you should have 4 total family members , that alleviated some of our icky feeling about the game . This is something where it feels like the expansion packs are really necessary to give the game that extra emphasis and enjoyability , which feels deceptive.Other thing : the & # 34 ; storytelling & # 34 ; is quite irrelevant to the actual mechanics of the game ; you get no points for the quality of your story and while you are technically encouraged to integrate your family members ' stories with those of the other players ' families , it has zero effect on the game.There is actually disincentive to be interesting , because the shorter your turn and the quieter you are about your character , the less the other players notice how many points you are racking up on your character.Basically we wished we ended our gaming party with CAH and not gotten out Gloom , because it made all of us quite Gloomy .	-1
I played Citadels three times , two with the regular rules and once with the included expansion cards , and all three games with max ( or close to max ) players . I did n't like it very much any time I played it . The game always drags toward the end and feels too long by 15-30 minutes . The most frustrating part is the high probability of the other players targeting you every turn ( regardless of which character you pick to play , which can change every turn , but is often easy to figure out who is going to be who ) . If you get targeted , you could lose your turn ( assassin ) , gold ( thief ) , districts ( warlord ) or special ability ( witch ) , none of which is any fun . It makes some characters impossible to choose no matter how much you need their special ability , because you know the other players will target them ( especially the witch from the expansion , who steals their special ability and gets to go first ) . I like competitive strategy games but Citadels was simply too cut-throat for me . The game 's artwork and production values are excellent , except for the gold coins , which are really just unpunched butterscotch-colored buttons and look it . For me , the unpunched buttons were a real letdown after the realistic ( if tiny ) gold coins that came withRio Grande Games Dominion : Seaside . My preference for competitive card games suitable for the whole family would be forDominion , which you can customize to increase or decrease the number of attack cards ( even down to zero if you prefer ) and is never the same game twice . Citadels is always the same boring game , even though you get random district cards and ca n't always be the same character every turn .	-1
This card game has a few flaws . The cards do not fit in standard card protectors ( have to use some obscure sized protectors ) if you want to lengthen the life of the cards . The game play lacks much if you have played Dominion or any other similar style card game . I think if you have never played Dominion it might be a really fun game , but after having played dominion or any other similar game , this game just feels shallow . Game play becomes predictable quickly in small groups and is only made slightly better by adding more players . Replay value is low at best since there are no expansions or different occupations to mix in and out of the game . Save your money and learn a card game with more variety .	-1
First of all , I always wanted to play this game and was thrilled when a member of our game night group decided to purchase and learn how to play it , as to teach the rest of us . That is the only positive thing I can say about the experience . We played a competitive game with 7 people , and all I can say was that after the first hour of 5 and 1/2 hours of play most of us were trying to figure out how to kill our characters off so we could stop the game and lose . Unfortunately , like the horror that it is , it will not let you do that because the weaker you get , the weaker the games monsters get . I do n't know if that is an intentional mechanic of the game or just the way it turned out for our play , but it seems the game is determined to make you go through the hell of playing for the entire night and most of the next morning just to get it over with . We started at 9 p.m. and did not finish ( and we actually beat the game mind you ) until 4 a.m. the next morning ; and remember we already had a person who knew how to play leading us through , so it was not like we spent hours setting up and getting started , that actually only took about 45 min . ( which , is in my opinion a deal breaker for any game , set up should be easy and take no more than 5-10 min. , max , if you know how to play , 20-30 min . max for first time ) , the rule book alone is almost 30 pages long and do n't expect a quick start or `` idiots '' guide to help it get moving , cuz there aint one . This game is so convoluted and without plot that building any kind of strategy is pointless , and there is no real storyline to get into or pass the time . Most of the time , whenever you do face something , it will knock you down to almost nothing before you even get a chance to fight it , so you are unlikely to be successful , most of the locations on the game require funds and achievements that take hours to get in order to get what the site offers . The mechanics are so flawed/boring that most of the time the players are sitting in the `` Nether Regions '' twiddling their thumbs for 30-45 minutes ( usually two or more rounds ) , waiting to get to do something because their character has been `` KO 'd '' or they are attempting to close a gate . The end was very anti-climatic and occurred with little action or fan fair . If you think this game looks like fun I would suggest finding someone else who has it and play it with them first before you spend the money , or purchase A Touch of Evil from Flying Frogs productions which is this same basic game with all of the stupid , repetitive , boring , pointless , convolutions and bad mechanics removed and therefor much more fun to play and far less time consuming . I mean really , 5.5 hours ? I would not want to play my favorite game of all time ( which is a Flying Frog game by the way , Fortune and Glory ) for 5.5 hours . The board in this game is too large and the writing is too small , so you spend half the night standing up looking over the shoulder of your fellow gamers , trying to read what occurs at each location , to figure out if it is worth traveling to that site . The board is also very non-descript and unattractive and you better have a very large table to play it on because there is a lot of crap that needs to be on the table at one time for this game , I can not even imagine how large and drug out the expansions for this game would make it . Again , my advice would be let someone else sport the bill for this one and play with them or get A Touch of Evil instead if you want a fun night of gaming . But , if you enjoy wishing you could have the last 5.5 hours of your life back after the fact , and I guess there is some Lovecraftian masochism to that , than by all means ignore my recommendation and purchase this game . If you are a diehard Lovecraft fan and just love anything that has to do with the Cthulhu mythos , no matter how entertaining it is , or is n't , than I suppose you might like this game ; only one person in our group falls into the category of that big of Lovecraft fan , so we do not . As a last thought , just to let you know , our group is a hardcore gaming group , that plays everything from D & D to Clue , so it is not the fact that we are not up to games of this magnitude , in fact we love convoluted and complicated , as long as it is fun and has a purpose beyond just being convoluted and complicated , this game is and does neither .	-1
I initially enjoyed playing this game due to the co-op nature and how intriguing/random it is but as I 've played it more and more , I 've begun to dislike it more and more . There is so much happening with the game but the payoff is rarely worth it . I 'll play it if my group is playing it but otherwise , I want nothing to do with it.Basic Play - You select a character , your choice or at random , and get all equipment/money they are entitled to . Select a random Ancient One to battle . You spend the rest of the game navigating the board looking for clues , buying items , getting skills/spells/allies , fighting enemies and going into portals to close/seal them . Your character card has stats you can change at the beginning of every turn . For example , you can increase your ability to move around the board faster but this decreases your ability to sneak past enemies . You can increase your luck but this decreases your lore . Each character has their own individual max/minimums for each stat , starting stuff , and special ability that makes them unique . Almost everything you do in this game will be done with dice . Rolling a 5 or 6 is a success while a 1-4 is a fail . You might enter a room and have to make a luck check , so you 'll see what your character 's luck rating is and get that many dice to roll . One 5 or 6 and you 're good but if you get none than you fail . There are cards and other things that can modify your abilities . Enemies require that you do all damage at once to kill them . So if an enemy has 3 life and you get 2 hits , he takes no damage and hits you and next round you will have to get 3 hits still to kill it . You ca n't team up in combat with another player , even though this is a co-op game , to kill an enemy . All battles are one on one , except the final battle , if it happens . If you die at any point in the game , you simply re-spawn and lose half your items . It is possible to be devoured , in which case your character is permanently dead and you select a new character and come back onto the board with all their starting stuff ( it is often better to be devoured then killed ) . There are a ton of locations to visit in the game , all of them have a set of 7 cards that you pick one from at random to see what happens to you . Some locations have special text on them where you can choose to do what the text says rather than draw a random card , such as the item shops or medical areas . All players will go and then at the end of every round , a portal gate will open , if possible , and bring out monsters , if possible , and make monsters move , if possible . You win the game if you close all gates ( certain restrictions apply ) , seal 6 or more gates ( by using 5 clue tokens or a special item ) , or kill the ancient one if he awakens . You lose if the ancient one awakens ( which can happen multiple ways ) and you fail to defeat him.Components - This game just has way too many pieces . The board is huge , you will need a large table to play this on , especially if you get any of the expansions that make the board even larger . The board itself is nice to look at and well made . There are 16 large character cards and 8 ancient one cards to select from each game . They look nice and have unique stories for each of the characters on the back . There are 196 token pieces , 189 different cards your characters can acquire ( split into 11 piles ) , 179 ancient one cards ( split into 3 piles , the location pile will be split into 9 different piles ) , 60 monster tokens , 16 gate tokens and at least 30 more random tokens/markers/dice . On the plus side , everything looks nice and it 's unlikely anything will get worn out or damaged . On the negative side , you need a ton of room to place all this stuff , and then you need more room for each person playing the game . Also , the cards your characters can acquire are the smaller , annoying , hard to shuffle style of cards ( such as Ticket to Rides train car cards ) . The rulebook is large and it is 24 pages . It is somewhat rough to get through and you 'll have to check back multiple times during your first couple playthroughs , probably even in some later playthroughs . There are no gameplay sheets to hand out to players , which you 'll want and need , so make sure you go online and find a friendly gameplay sheet to print out for players , you can find them at BoardGameGeek . The insert for the game is ok . I do n't think they provided any baggies so you 'll want to get some to put all the different pieces in.Length - This game takes a long time , especially your first couple playthroughs . Expect setup to take you about 15-30 minutes since you have to select characters , enemies , distribute starting items/cash/skills/life/sanity/etc , then you have to shuffle each deck of cards , play a starting mythos card and place the gate and enemies . The actual game itself will run at least 4 hours for your initial play-through . It still regularly takes my group 2 1/2 - 3 hours to play a game . I 'm the guy that actually keeps the game moving because I want to get through it . They tried playing it once without me and it took them over 5 hours because they could n't stay focused.Re-playability - This is one of the big positives of the game . There is a lot of re-playability due to all the characters , ancients ones ( that have various effects on monsters and gameplay ) , and just the random nature of the game . Game win/loss conditions change depending on the number of players , along with how many monster spawns and other various rules.Luck - Almost everything you do in this game requires you to roll dice . There is a ton of luck . I 've watched 11 dice come up with no successes and 3 dice get 3 successes . Every location card you draw has something random happen at the location that could be good or bad . You might have your lore skill maxed out ( which leaves you with little to no luck ) and draw a helpful/hurtful card that requires lore to pass . Of course , you might draw a card that requires luck to pass and you do n't get to roll at all if you have no luck . Also , most cards take a die or two away from whatever skill check you are making . Monsters only move if the mythos card drawn at the end of each turn say so . So if you go into a room and a monster blocks the exit , you have to either fight or sneak past . Some monsters are extremely difficult to kill and some are difficult to sneak past , some have both . So if one of those tough to sneak/fight monsters is blocking your room , enjoy being stuck in there for the next couple turns . There are also random cards that just cause you to die/get devoured , so enjoy that as well.Interaction - There is surprisingly little interaction needed for this game . You might give someone an item once a game or use a special power to help someone but for the most part , everyone just kind of does there own thing . You ca n't team up to fight monsters or close/seal gates . Most of the interaction will just be game banter.Thoughts pros - Hard to think of a lot at this point . There is a ton of theme . Can play 1-8 players . Components are all good quality and look nice . A lot of things you can do , characters and bad guys to pick . The co-operative aspect is nice , I guess.Thoughts cons - Can someone show me where the fun is ? It takes a while to slog thorough and is just way to random . It 's rough to teach to new players , you 're better off just playing and hoping they pick up as they go along . The rules are annoying to remember . There are many rules that change depending on the number of people playing , so you have to look those up each game . Even after many playthroughs , using cheat sheets , I 'm pretty sure we still have a rule or two wrong . The co-op aspect is n't really used that often . Occasionally someone will give an item away but most of the time it 's just spent deciding which gate someone is going to go into . Everyone pretty much just does their own thing ; and I 've sat in one location for the majority of the game doing nothing and we still win most of the time . I 've also found that there is very little strategy required . The game gives you all of these options but I 've found it breaks down to 4 different things . 1 . If you have 5 clues or the item that seals a gate , go into a gate . 2 . If you ca n't close a gate and have money , go to the special item store and try to buy the item that automatically seals a gate ( I think there are 3 or 4 of them in the special item deck ) . 3 . If you have no money , run around and pick up clues . 4 . If you have no money and there are no clues , just sit in a room where you have a good shot at earning clues/money . For example , of the 7 cards for the newspaper location , some give you money with no rolling , some give a luck ( -1 ) check for a clue and one gives you a lore ( -1 ) check for 3 clues . So you just sit in that room and earn money or clues and then use whatever you earned . Using this strategy , I 've only lost 2 of about 10+ we 've played . There have been a couple last turn thrillers where we won , but other than that , not much fun here . There are some locations that have almost no purpose . It is extremely rare that someone goes to the common item shop and buys a common item , or goes to the magic shop to buy magic , or goes to the skill area to buy a skill . You 're better off just trying to draw the special item that lets you seal a gate . Some location cards wo n't be drawn because there is no purpose to going there , I 've never seen anyone draw a location card for the hospital , magic shop , common item shop , church , boarding house or curiositie shoppe . There is no reason to visit these spots outside of their special text options . Certain mythos cards have text on them titled `` environment '' that cause effects that alter the game ( all players get +1 luck/-1 lore , or no spells can be cast , etc ) and these can be annoying to remember sometimes . Combat also is n't that interesting . Most of the time , your character will fit one of two molds , decked out for combat or do n't bother fighting anything that has more than one life . Also , enemies are very uneven , there only seem to be 2 difficulties , ridiculously easy or ridiculously hard . There are very few that fall in between . You 'll probably have one player who just runs around killing enemies . Sometimes you 'll let yourself get killed or get devoured because it 's beneficial . I should n't get rewarded for dying.I was n't sure whether I wanted to give this a 3 or 2 stars , but what decided it for me was that I 'll enjoy playing a 3 star game once and a while , but this game , I just want it to be over as soon as possible . I do n't like Pandemic , but I will play that over this any time . This game just takes too long to setup ( I 'd rather setup Axis & Allies ) and play for the little payoff it gives and there are too many cards/pieces . I do n't mind longer games but there needs to be entertainment or a payoff in the gameplay and there is neither in this game . The game is n't hard , it 's just random . Everything is too random and you 're at the mercy of the dice . There is next to no strategy or thinking required , you just hope something random does n't happen to screw you . There are too many fiddly rules and too many pieces to fiddle with , even some monsters have to be removed from the group of monsters because they 're only used if a specific ancient one is in play . You 've got to remember what special power the ancient one gives enemies plus environments and events . People that love this game seem to love it for the theme . I guess that 's ok , but for me , theme , presentation etc ... mean very little if the core gameplay is n't good . I 'd much rather play generic themed game with ugly looking components that has interesting/good gameplay than this game . There is just nowhere near enough good things about this game to make up for the many negatives of the game . I think I 'd rather play Risk than this game . At least I can spread myself thin in Risk and get killed to end the suffering , this just goes on and on . I 'm tired of playing this game , I 'm either not going to play it from now on or just play my 3DS or read a book while playing , at least then I 'll feel like I 'm doing something entertaining . Overall , I have to give this game a 3/10 .	-1
I had great expectations from all the position 4 and 5 star reviews of this game . I have a few board based fantasy games like Descent and Heroscape , both great games giving hours of replayability , and obviously high quality of design and materials . This one disappoints . All of the pieces give the word MINIATURE and new definition . The pieces are so small they are in the description realm of RIDICULOUS . FFS is obviously saving dollars in name of sacrificing quality and quantity . Some of the pieces , like the plastic gold coins and the pyramind cones are literally 1/4 '' in height and diameter . The handful of plastic molded characters are at most about 1 inch high as well . The spell and casting cards are all so small they would be small for a 5 year old 's hand . The board is quite large , about 3 foot by 2 made of cardboard . Not much here folks , especially for the cost of the game . This is a 12 dollar game at a 50 dollar price .	-1
Well , this game is based on most popular game warhammer 40K , which I played in pervious 15 years and I also have space hulk since 2nd edition . I like the art work on this card game , and wish this game to be portable space hulk . Sadly , no ... ... This game is soso . You do need 13+ for this game as it listed on the box due to the complicated setting , and there is n't any armor save , special weapon , and combat experience as warhammer 40K . Most likely , it 's a game with 2 monsters `` broodlord & genestealer '' . Rolling 4+ to kill gensteraler and 5+ to kill broodlord per a 6 sides dice . Each space marines has different attacking range from 0 to 3 . If you get stormbolter mark as supplement , you get a chance to reroll . The game end when space marines all died , or run out of location card with having done the assignment of last location card . It 's very simple , but there are location and event cards , not easy for players to image the whole area as space hulk board game.After trying couple runs with friends , we gave up this game . It 's not fun as we expected . Not with the experience as warhammer 40K and the space hulk board game . It a card game without the spirit of warhammer 40k , but art work ... ..	-1
As noted in my other relevant game reviews , I 'm I am always looking for games I can play with my fiance . She is what some would call a `` reluctant gamer '' whereas I am an avid gamer , so I have be careful about what games I introduce her to . She prefers games that rely at least a little on luck ( i.e. , not all strategy ) and are n't too complex ( i.e. , where you can learn/remember the mechanic after a game or two ) , whereas I love strategy and complexity but do n't mind a little luck . We also like games you can finish in a single session ( or games you can play multiple times in a single session ) This game fit the bill perfectly.Based on what I 've read about this game on Amazon and BoardGameGeek this one seemed like a real contender . And , there were many things we liked about this game . We liked the theme -- you really feel like you are going on a journey ( and that you got to play familiar characters and see lots of familiar faces and places along the way ) , the fact that it is cooperative , and the fact that we had n't played anything quite like it before . And , I know lots of other people enjoy the game , and I by no means mean any disrespect to them by giving it a two star rating.But , after playing it twice with her ( and a third time with two gamer friends ) , we all felt the exact same way ... it just did n't feel very enjoyable to us . Most of the game play was good but not great ( probably 3.5 stars ) , but the ending was main problem . After all your hard work ( and assuming you are lucky enough to get to the end in the first place ) , whether you win or lose often comes down to a simple dice roll . This was very anticlimactic . No game should end that way.Given that there are also ways to lose along the way ( in fact , it is quite possible you 'll never get to the end ... which was not a big problem as seeing how far you get each time can be a worthwhile challenge in and of itself ) , it seemed to us that if you get to the end something besides a random dice roll should determine the outcome of the game . At best ( if things went very well along the way ) , you may get to make multiple dice rolls which can increase your chances of winning . But , ultimately a dice roll will decide your fate .	-1
This game has serious flaws which Fantasy Flight refuses to address . I have owned it for over a year now and they are in denial or simply do n't care about the problems it has . The Lannisters are completely broken and it basically ruins the fun of the game . FF is usually a great company but they drop the ball on this product in both the original edition and now again in this one . I would not recommend this game to anyone and it sits on my shelf gathering dust . It is a great concept and an amazing genre , but the broken aspects of the game ( Lannisters are far to weak and Stark/Baratheon are FAR too strong ) make the game boring and unplayable .	-1
Other than being very pretty , I do n't get why this game has such high reviews . This is coming from someone who loves LOTR and MTG .	-1
The most fun part of a little girl 's diary is the lock , and this one is difficult to manipulate and of poor quality . Also , the diary has only lined , blank pages ; there are no pages that are pre-formatted with questions or prompts for the child to enter fun information about herself . Next time , I will pay a little more for a higher-quality product .	-1
After buying this base set and 3 add-on expansions , I regret it . I heard it was one of the best in it 's class and have always loved the Fantasy theme especially in board/card games , so I bought it . ( Side note : I played the regular rules and then the Tom Vasel `` Epic Thunderstone '' rules as well . ) I guess now after other complex card games have come out , it 's easy to be down or negative on this historical game . For it was the 3rd game to come out in this genre as a `` deck-builder '' type game and still be different from classic , popular and all powerful Magic the Gathering card game.What is nice is that you do n't have to take out a large loan to buy this game ( like Magic ) . Instead it has a rather large amount of cards right in the box ready to be played . I do enjoy fantasy based games and video games so I was hoping this would fit my desires , but sadly this game falls incredibly flat.Quality : The cards have a nice raised textured pattern to them and fairly thick . The box is thick with a very nice insert to help you organize the cards . It all has a nice quality and will probably stand up over time . My only concern here is , much of the cards are surrounded by black ink and if you scratch or `` nick '' the cards , it is very visible ( and does n't look good ) .Art/Graphics : I have listened to other game reviews `` rave '' about the art , and until recent expansions of this game , I do not agree with the others . I do not like the art ( especially the base set ) and think it is n't up to the standards of the rest of the gaming world . Some cards they are down-right comical . Not to mention some of the art does not match and looks like another game entirely and very different styled artists were employed to create it.Price/Value : This game is very overpriced . For the amount of cards you get and the thickness of the box and it 's nice insert , it 's more worth $ 20-30 , but not the asking price.Base mechanics : Basically deck building games imply that you are BUILDING your hand in order to be able to do actions on your turn ( e.g . slay a monster or buy a good weapon ) . In many other games ( such as the video game World of Warcraft or Skyrim ) you can customize your character in order to be successful at your deeds . Collecting weapons and `` heroes '' , only serve to give you attack points or buying points . For a hero really is n't a HERO in Thunderstone . This hero is just a number on a card with some art . You could have pasted a factory worker on the card trying to repair a broken down assembly line , because the theme and actions seem completely `` pasted on '' .On your turn , you use 6 cards in your hand to do buying or attacking ... that 's it . If you do n't have the right cards drawn on your turn , you may or may not do anything . However , simply to the point , the game ends up being is a `` gathering card '' game . As soon as you see your opponent killing monsters ( and getting victory points in the process ) it 's a sprint for the finish line . It does n't feel like a game , and at times the game felt like it was playing me . Thunderstone has very little strategy and much too much chance/luck involved . Thunderstone seems like an advanced version of Dominion which is a hugely boring game to me.To End : I should try and sell mine on Ebay where I 'd get a great price for it . But I am probably going to keep it for those friends who want a think-less non-complicated game . Thunderstone is so flat and `` outright nothingness '' to it 's core mechanics , that I am incredibly surprised this game is so popular . There is so many better games out there , that you would be better off with another one of them . For example , Lord of the Rings Living Card Game and/or Mage Knight are similar in theme and both are card games , yet they both have real consequences to what you do and real strategy that require you to think things through and make good decisions.In the end , `` to each his own '' , and this game does n't appeal to me or involve `` fun '' . However , do n't take my word for it , be very careful and watch some youtube videos on how it 's played before you buy ... you 'll be glad you did the extra research .	-1
I installed fresh batteries in the robot and started it up . Looked briefly at the manual and realized programming it actually would n't be that hard . Just tell it to do a quick 1 foot square . So I entered the necessary info ( it 's really not as hard as other reviewers make it sound - or maybe they 're just not accustomed to toys like this ) and told it to run the program . The robot was supposed to go straight for one foot . It went slooooooooooooowly to the right . One of the side tracks was n't moving at all . In fact , that specific side did n't move at all during the whole program.I inspect the non-moving track and even tried to make it budge a little . I even checked the batteries just to see if I had bought ones that were drained . They were n't . I tried to get the robot to run the program again . Same thing . It barely moved and what movement it did make was slightly to an angle . To put it simply , the unit was broken.The concept of this robot seems interesting . I could see this as stepping stone for a child . It would help , however , if it actually worked .	-1
MoM has excellent looking pieces , clear rules and a modular system that should support replayability ... but the core concept of players vs a DM just does n't work . Simply put , it 's very difficult to get invested when 1 player ( the DM ) has a turn on every players turn , plus his own , and generally has little trouble stomping out your hopes for victory . And there lies the problem ( as best I can tell ) that the DM is n't really supposed to try to win - his or her job is really just to flavor the story and lead the players along . Unfortunately , that 's ill communicated in the rules and hard for most players to grasp and the result is a game where 2-4 players get to do very little while 1 player interrupts their turns and , after an hour or so , wins the game.Not a problem if your group goes in with the right mindset , but not really fun at all without that .	-1
Again , like Arkham Horror , I really looked forward to playing this game , and once again I was terribly disappointed . If you like playing games where all you do is roll dice all night long trying to get a certain combination play D & D , if you want to do that a be really bored play this . Literally , all you do in this game is roll dice trying to get some combination required on each card that gets progressively harder with each successful role in order to obtain a few objects on the card that really do nothing as far as helping you win the game other than the elder signs . However , by the time you actually manage to collect any of these the monster will have already woke up so they will be of no use to you because then it will just come down to rolling dice to see if you can inflict enough damage to kill it before it kills you . The only upside to this game is it was over in about 45 min . instead of the 5.5 hours its big brother Arkham Horror took .	-1
So , this is a star wars game , if you like star wars you will most likely buy this . If you like playing fun games then this is not the game you want to buy . I have played it about 5 times and hopefully will never play it again . At its heart it is a dive rolling game , that is pretty much it . You roll dice , move your ship along a card board strip and roll the dice again . Yeah , save your money and get King of Tokyo instead , if you are looking for fun in a dice rolling game .	-1
I thought these were made of metal , they are a in fact made of a cheap plastic material which after some use I feel will easily break .	-1
The only reason that they can even justify selling this pack is because they do n't include enough dice in the core pack to begin with . If they had included just one more of each die in the core set you 'd be fine . A marketing scam if you ask me .	-1
When these are in stock in game stores you can get this set for $ 5 , apparently the fact that they are in between runs makes all the game shops feel like they should screw the customers . $ 20 for this set is outlandish , at that price I would say just go ahead and flip for the additional $ 10 and get a whole other starter set . That way you get the dice and an extra x-wing and two ties to go with it . My suggestion is at this price , stay away and just play with the ones that came with it . It is not ever necessary to have the extra dice they are only a convenience and at $ 20 not a very good one . There will be another run of these here soon ( late April-June ) and all of you with out the patience to wait will be kicking your self for paying such a stupid price . At the $ 5 price I would give this a 4 star rating because they are nice to have and make game play faster but at $ 20 , no way . It is time we all start teaching these stores that price gouge that it will not pay , by us as customers not giving in and paying their outrageous prices . Just wait , they will be inexpensive again , just like the Millennium Falcon and the Tie interceptors will be .	-1
My eight year old is entering his first science fair , thus we have been experimenting with various potential projects . I bought him this kit for some ideas . The experiments , and our results:1 . Telegraph . This BARELY worked . By that , the paper clip telegraph clicker ( which was supposed to 'tap ' the head of a nail ) hardly moved at all . No clicking , just a slight movement.2 . Light Flashing Generator . This appeared to be the easiest invention , and the one my son was most excited about . However , I was provided an incorrect part as the light bulb holder displayed in the instructions looked NOTHING like the one in the box , and there was **no way** to transfer electricity to it . Thus this did not work at all.3 . Radio . As with all the `` inventions '' I followed the instructions to a tee . We spent close to an hour putting this together exactly per the instructions , and of course it did not work . Then again , I really did not think we would make a radio out of toilet paper rolls and alumninum foil.4 . Motor . This one we actually got to work , and it was very cool . Of course we had to deviate quite a bit from the instructions to get it to work.The instructions are sorely lacking . It is mainly pictures with instructions that state , `` Build the telegraph like this '' pointing to the fully built telegraph ( as an example ) .If you are looking to purchase some science experiments for your child , I would not recommend this at all . Instead I would go with the Mythbusters series , which actually work .	-1
Some people get this game and some do n't . I get it and still do n't like it very much . It 's just way too random to ever be able to plan or carry out any kind of strategy over multiple turns . Having too many rules down at once causes turns to take forever , as you will have to stand up over the table and scan every card on the table in order to make a decision . If you & # 34 ; get & # 34 ; the game then you will have fun for a few hours , then quickly get bored with the limited effect that skill and planning have on your chances of winning .	-1
I can not get anyone to play this with me after the first play . I was n't that enthralled with it but I do know that sometimes it takes a few plays to really get `` into '' a game so I am disappointed that I ca n't do that . There are only 3 of us here , a 26 y.o . and his parents so I think maybe that 's the problem . Also , the whole outcome of the game is dependent on luck and I think we like games that involve a little strategy as well as luck . It is probably more fun with more people and some kids thrown in the mix . Lots of reading necessary for this one though so not too young .	-1
We 've only played a few times , but so far we have n't found this card game lives up to the other reviews . There are basically 3 types of cards : goal , action and keeper/creeper . Goals can ( possibly ) change from one player to the next , so you do n't plan ahead . Actions can take several minutes to play depending on what they are , so even with 4 playing , it may be 5-7 minutes before your turn comes around again , so has n't held our interest .	-1
I bought this for my verbal eight year old based on the reviews . We have had it one year now and have played it 3 or 4 times . For us , the negatives are : 1 ) you are essentially playing alone , building your own crossword without even needing to know what the other person is doing . The only time you pay attention to them is when they take a tile and you have to take one too . 2 ) the child ( at least mine ) sometimes needs help fitting in awkward letters or reconfiguring her board , but she 's on her own in this game . Handicapping the adults by having them pull more tiles does n't even this out so overt help is needed , which makes it less fun . 3 ) the child is not learning any new words since they do n't need to pay any attention to any board other than their own , so the educational value is less.If you are like us and think the above negatives are deal-breakers , then I would recommend the game Catch-Phrase which is interactive , educational , fast-paced , and kids can play even with adults if you let them skip phrases they do n't recognize . ( They still learn the phrases when they hear them defined on other people 's turns . ) We have the card , rather than electronic version . It 's a blast . Kids over on playdates always drag it out , and when we have family over everyone wants to play . This has never happened with Bananagrams .	-1
The organs felt gross as promised , but the workmanship ( or work-machine-ship ) was so shoddy that we immediately whisked it away from the 4-year-old and sent it back . Luckily , he 's forgotten all about it .	-1
The organs and bones snap in to hold them in place , problem is it does n't stay . its such a tight fit , one part snaps in causing a chain reaction of other parts popping out . With these distractions the teaching focus is lost and quickly becomes more a puzzle project than a teaching opportunity ; net-net , not a good teaching tool . Its also much smaller than I thought it would be . We returned it .	-1
Purchased this for our 6 year old . tried to play it once . the instructions were too difficult to understand and play . getting rid of it today .	-1
NOT SUCH A FUN GAME , UNLESS WE JUST DO N'T KNOW HOW TO PLAY , BUT SO FAR , WITH ABOUT 3 VERSIONS THAT WE HAVE TRIED , IT IS N'T ALL THAT GREAT .	-1
This came with only the tiles . No instructions and we still have not figured out a way to print instructions from Mindware 's site . There is also supposed to be a bag -- this was missing , too .	-1
Had a family night with this one ... Pros : Lots of InstructionsShort and Longer gameplay on gameboardCons : ConfusingHave not heard of many of the filmsBoring and Loses interest because most of the stuff has never been seen before even though we watch tons of movies and tvShort review but I say pass on this one !	-1
We had a big family game night last week and I broke out the new Scene It Comedy edition . It featured written instructions as well as instructions given on the DVD which was included . The game board can also be expanded for longer games . About 10 of us played the game and most of us were confused by the questions . I have never heard of a lot of the movies that were included . All in all , unless you are a complete comedy movie buff , I do not recommend . I have played other Scene It Games in the past and enjoyed them - I think I just was n't into the Comedy Movies that were included .	-1
Right before I played Scene It Magical Moments for the first time , I played a round of a 2nd edition Disney Scene It that I already owned . That was great fun . Sadly , the new Magical Moments edition is just not very good.The presentation is pretty abysmal in comparison to other games . The Second Edition board had pictures of characters on each space . It was rather attactive . Magical Moments on the other hand simply has blank spaces and a few random ( and they are quite random ) characters thrown on the board . Also gone are the double move spaces , which is sort of inexplicable . The Buzz cards are now retangular instead of circular and do n't fit as nicely on the board . Obviously , they went out of their way to make some changes , I just ca n't figure out why . Also , one of the playable characters is the hero from the upcoming Disney movie `` Tangled . '' Seriously ? No Mickey Mouse , Donald Duck or any of those classic characters but we get Rapunzel ? This game of Scene It plays pretty much like any other game of Scene It . You roll , you move , you answer a question on the DVD or cards and if you get it right , you move again . Unfortunately , the first roller had moved three quarters of the way around the board before getting a question wrong . And that was only because that person lost an `` all play '' which is really the only way to end a turn in this new game . They also added a new DVD category called `` my puzzle '' which allows you to use the DVD remote to pick an answer . These are also too easy.The clips remain amusing , but the questions are just too easy for your average Disney fan . Since I assume only Disney fans would pick up a game like this , it seems rather hopeless that people will have a lot of fun . So my recommendation would be to go purchase Scene It Disney Second Edition , which really is a run and often challenging game .	-1
If you 're an obsessive fan of all the new B effort motion pictures and direct-to-video sequels being pumped out by the Disney studio , then you 're likely to be very pleased with this game , which seems to give a lot more attention to Bolt and the newest Winnie the Pooh cash-in than the classic masterpieces that made Disney a household name in the first place . Few and far between are My Play and All Play questions relating to the classics , instead utilizing the game as a sort of advertisement for all the garbage that is n't already in your video collection.Add to this a thoroughly lackluster presentation ( at least the disk loads faster because there are n't any impressive sounds , images , and effects to cue ) , and I give Disney a C-/D+ for their efforts here . It works , and some families are going to enjoy it , but those of us who think of Snow White and Beauty and the Beast when we hear the name `` Disney '' are n't going to have much use for this game .	-1
DVD games are a real mixed bunch . Sometimes they are good , sometimes they are bad . But when they are bad , they tend to be horrible . My kids really enjoy the little mini-games the come as extras on some movie DVDs , so I thought I would give this game a shot . While it is not the worst game I 've ever played , it ranks pretty close.The pacing of this game is just too slow . I got bored , my kids got bored , and in the end we just pushed on to say that we finished . I do n't think we even got excited about a winner . Do n't get me wrong , I think that if the family sat down to do this as a Christmas chat type activity , it would be better . We just sat down to play it ( we were too busy to play during the holidays ) and there just was n't any magic . I think that a game should be fun no matter when you play it , so I am not taking the `` Christmas Magic '' into account in my rating.Overall : If you need a family activity for Christmas time , you could do worse than this . Just do not think that this is a game that you will get out often ( or even every Christmas ) . As with most DVD games , replay value is very limited .	-1
I was trying to find a kind of fantasy game to play with my 6 year old son and this was a fail . It was confusing and boring . The goals are just having certain cards . Too many cards for my son to keep track of and the play was really boring . I will try the Dungeon board game next , that 's probably more like what I was looking for .	-1
There 's no strategy to this game . The conditions of victory are constantly changing so there 's no way to know who is close to winning . Someone just wins out of nowhere . It 's basically the same as rolling dice to see who wins . It 's incredibly boring and I 'm perplexed that people rate it so highly .	-1
The idea is great , but the numbers are so small a child has trouble seeing what color to use . The finished products are good , but getting there is tough for youngsters .	-1
a simulater replicates what the real thing is ever used a rc controller ? well throttel is on the left pitch yaw , elevator.. on right.. right ? well to tally reveresed on this .. so im trying build ..instincts on the sticks .. well learn on this when you got 200 or more on a model , crash your cash its backwards ! ! ! i have flown real airplanes have 83 hrs solo . this would kill you in the real world.. now sims are awesome this will waste your model.. because ... the inputs on this.. mirror revers from spektrum.. futuba.. nice game though ... lol forget this # $ % ok get a real one.. ok ?	-1
First , mine arrived DOA but it was obvious that this is a toy and not really appropriate for proper training in radio control operation . It 's too small , does n't have trim control and the sticks have none of the feel that an actual controller does . I did n't get to test its accuracy since it was defective but even if it was spot on , there are much better options out there - check out the Dynam 6ch controller - it is life size , has trim control , good feel on the sticks and works well with Clearview SE ( free ) . Do n't even bother to download FSM , it is outdated , no longer supported and not all that good when it works . The upgrade of Clearview is only $ 35 to get all the models and airfields or buy them one at a time to add to the freeware version.Props to Amazon as they immediately issued a return label and promptly credited me back my funds . Notice this is sold by a 3rd party vendor but fulfilled by Amazon - that makes all the difference in the world since the seller has to comply with Amazon 's policies .	-1
Do n't click buy . Quality is not there , does n't hold up well . Broke after a few uses . Would not recommend to anyone .	-1
Great and fun ... .for about two weeks . Then the battery craps out and wont hold a charge anymore . If only they made a better battery ... .	-1
This cheap little helicopter was pretty fun but did n't last.My 5 year old pretty much destroyed it . I know , not rated for a 5 year old but I only let him play with it after the tail rotor would n't spin.Figured how much damage could he do going up and down.Well , turns out quite a bit . Anyways its cheap.Its cheap , did I mention that ?	-1
Got it for Christmas and sadly it turned on for 2 minutes and never worked again . I have no idea why , but we never even got to fly it . Im not sure if my particular one was defective . Complete waste of $ 30.00	-1
A cheap but fun helicopter . It will not fly after several hours of use no matter what you do.I enjoyed three of them but bought a much larger and better one and it has many hours of flight time.Look for a better one and it is worth it . You can not use this outdoors at all .	-1
We purchased three of these helicopters and initially was very pleased . The helicopters are easy to control and very durable . Unfortunately , two out of the three seem to have significantly weakened batteries . They only fly for about 10 seconds before slowly falling to the ground even at maximum power . I 'm going to look for replacement batteries , but it is not designed to be replaced and will require soldering to get it to work .	-1
I just got word from my sis in law that the heli we sent my nephew for Christmas is a dud . How sad ... He really was looking fwd to this gift . The box seal was broken upon arrival and my sis said it looks like it might have been opened , but she would wrap it and give it to him anyways and turns out it doesnt even work . We purchased this from SVM but it was fulfilled through Amazon ( I recently just read some knock off Syma helicopters were being sold through here so I wonder if ours was one or if it was truly a dud ) and they have initiated a refund for us and sent out a new one already . So I give Amazon 5 stars for the effort ! I hope the new one works .	-1
I 've been through two of these little helicopters now and , while they 're fun , they 're really hard to maintain.I fly a couple of times a month . Not a lot , because I 'm busy , but I do have a good time flying . That infrequency plays a part in the problem , I think.First , the good part : This thing is really durable and super easy to fly . If you 've never flown an RC helicopter before , this is a good place to start . You can crash it and it wo n't break ; you can fly fairly erratically and it is easy to remain in control . That part is awesome.The part that is n't awesome is the `` no lift '' problem . If you go out and search for `` syma 107 no lift '' you 'll see tons of forums and articles talking about it . There 's even an Amazon discussion on this product about having no lift . For me , I think the problem stems from how difficult the battery is to maintain . It'sa tiny LiPo battery . LiPo batteries are pretty notoriously finicky about how you use them in comparison to NiMH or other batteries you might see in larger units.My first helicopter was great for about six months , then I went to fly it and at full throttle the blades would spin but I 'd get no lift . I took the whole thing apart , lubricated everything , checked the motors and the gears , but no matter what I did - no lift . I boughta replacement batteryand installed it , then charged it up . That did n't last more than a week or so until I again hit the `` no lift '' issue . Bad battery ? Motor problem ? Who knows . I do n't have the equipment to measure battery voltages and discharge rates ... and for the price , I 'm not sure I should HAVE to.At that point I bought a second one of these , since they 're not too expensive . I figured , worst case , I could use the first one as spare parts for the second if I needed to . That was four months ago , and this morning I fired up the heli and got about 10 seconds of lift , then ... done . Spinning blades , down on the table , no lift.Some of the articles out there will tell you this magic formula : Wait five minutes after charging before you fly ; only fly for a max of five minutes ; wait five minutes after you 're done flying before charging . I could n't tell you if that works since I found it long after this second one died.If I have time , which I probably wo n't , I may try to combine the two choppers into one functional unit , maybe with ( yet another ) new battery . That said , with the relative prices of batteries to the actual helicopter , you buy three or four batteries and you 've almost bought a whole new helicopter.Anyway , take good care of your battery and your helicopter will probably last a long time . Mine ( both ) did n't , so this gets two stars overall . I give it one for durability since the physical copter is pretty durable but the batteries are apparently fragile like glass .	-1
I bought 4 of these and they are really easy to fly and a lot fun . The first problem you will discover is the extremely short flight time . The flight time is 5 to 10 minutes for a brand new copter . The second problem is it does n't take very long to damage them to the point where repairs are needed . If you do n't damage it then you will find out that the battery life dies of pretty quickly . You will find that after you have flown it for several days that the flight time is getting shorter and shorter.It is educational because you will can get a lot of experience in how to repair RC Helicopters with the S107G . This model is repairable and parts are readily available . It does take good dexterity , mechanical ability , and good eyesight or reading glasses . When the batteries go bad , which is frequently , you can unscrew the cowling , pull the battery , cut the wires , trim the wires that remain and cut and trim the wires on the replacement battery . Then you get to solder the wires together and insulate them with tape . Yes you got the idea , no plugable battery connections , just a PIA POS that you have to solder in place . It IS VERY educational.I recommend bypassing the education by getting one and sending it back after it breaks which is usually two weeks or less if you fly it every day . This is well within the return policy for Amazon . Hey you get what you pay for , and for less than $ 20 , that is exactly what get . Do n't get me wrong it is a lot of fun to fly and if you like to tinker it is a WHOLE lot more fun .	-1
I purchased this as a gift for some friends ' son . I was embarrassed to find out the helicopter did not work when the birthday recipient opened it up . Luckily , Amazon accepted my return .	-1
First disappointment from Syma ... I have never gotten a bad product from them until now . This heli looks good , really good , but does n't have the power to lift off . It gets about a foot off the ground then drops like the battery is dead . It 's a shame , it looks really cool . I have 7 of their other ones . I would recommend any of their other products .	-1
I 'm really disappointed in this . We got it for our son and after one adult driven test drive to see how the controls worked ( with no major crashes ... a few wall bumps and one ceiling touch , by far nothing hard enough to visibly damage it ) and it would not lift off again after that . No visible damage , no gears stripped , full charge ... all it would do after the first 2 minute flight was spin on the ground . It 's repackaged and on it 's way back to Amazon as I type . Save your money .	-1
They must really be cranking these babies out as this one was missing one of the 4 main rotors ! ! ! I used a rotor from one of my older scrapped choppers and it will fly but this bird does not fly well at all . I have probably owned 20+ of these Syma type choppers and as they get older they typically do two things.1 . The battery life gets shorter and shorter.2 . They become harder to control in that they start doing sort of an oscillating motion if you arent in hard forward flight.This particular unit is doing the oscillating from the get go . Am sending this puppy back !	-1
I purchased this charger in January 2013 based on the good reviews . Unfortunately , I purchased ( new ) it from a vendor at a swap meet . It has always had a few quirks . Today , it gave me the infamous & # 34 ; SHORT ERR & # 34 ; message while charging at the club field . Now , I have no way of putting my lipos on storage charge until I buy a new charger . I 've tried different charging leads , charging from 110 and 12V car battery , etc . I would not recommend this charger .	-1
Out of the box one prop starts turning as soon as you plug in the battery . When you let go it starts going round and round inside the cage . Tried to fly it but totally uncontrollable so ordered a new one and will try again .	-1
The left stick , on the transmitter , controls power and left and right turns . The right hand stick , controls forward/reverse and left/right bank . This setup is most annoying . The transmitter antenna is a prop , so do n't expect outdoor type range . This is strictly an indoor toy.The quad copter cage definitely protects the props , but , it will soon become annoying . It rolls around constantly and hinders control even more.After 2 days , the electronic gyros went bad and it became impossible to fly .	-1
This is my 2nd H911 that I have returned . The first one because one ofthe batteries stopped charging after a few days and the batteries keptpopping out on crashes . Batteries in this one fits nice and snug.I am returning this one because the body and tail boom vibrates and shakesmaking for less than smooth flight.I will be trying a 3rd and 4th one.Just ordered the replacement for this one and a red/white BNF V911.It is a nice flying helicopter if you can get one w/o problems.2-3-2014 Received my replacement order for this H911 . The replacement is worse . The body and tail boom still vibrates . Now one of the 2 batteries connectors is crooked and requires some doing to get into the helicopter.I am down grading to 2 stars because of the vibration and battery not connecting well . I will not purchase anymore 911s . Quality control leaves something to be desired . Returning this one also .	-1
The game concept is good , and I 'd heard it was very fun , but this version is made on the cheap . Extremely lightweight and flimsy , the base does n't feel like it would survive an accidental drop . I might get an older copy that is more substantial , but I do not recommend this game .	-1
I had Mastermind as a child and loved it . For our wedding , we registered for this - the new version.The box is CHEAP - it will fall apart very easily . It is also way too big for what is included inside.The plastic board is also cheap , and the wall between the two types of pegs does not keep the pegs from mixing , so you end up picking the different pegs out of the other slot - time consuming ! Plus , the trays are so poorly constructed that it is almost impossible to close the lid without getting pegs stuck so that it ca n't close.They should have just used the same construction as the old sets , and they 'd have been much better off .	-1
My one complaint is the lack of spaces between the gamers.Everything else is quite nice for non active kids of this day , and age . Though I would recommend an open area to play . The bigger the better , and soft for falls.Carpets verse hardwood or title floors . If , playing , outside keep mat on a level surface . Avoid locations with tripping hazards , or little room to move .	-1
Small little set not what I expected . Found a much nicer larger set at one of the big dollar chains . A waste and not a good gift . Looks cheap	-1
I 'm not sure how these blocks got any positive reviews . Most important to me ... all the blocks with the pic of an elephant are misspelled and read `` elerhant '' . The pictures over all are not great . The grapes look like cherries ... have you ever seen candy apple red grapes ? The apples look like red pumpkins . Some of the blocks have pictures but the corresponding letter has been replaced by a symbol and other letters ... confusing to a child trying to learn . Additionally , the quality of these blocks is not great as the paint was already scratched off on a few when they arrived and the wood is frayed on some . They have a strong odor ( kind of like clay ) . Lastly , they are quite small as others warned although the size is clearly written in the description . I expect to see a set like this at a dollar store and would not recommend .	-1
It just wasnt fun . It didnt come with enough pieces for the price they were asking but we tried it anyway ... along with magnalinks..Magnalinks won us over in comparioson . I really dont even know what happened to theses gears..they were hard to snapped together my 3 year old and 4 year old and even my 8 year old had no interest in them.If you like this kind of stuff i recommend the magnalinks !	-1
I got this toy after reading reviews of other parents and thinking my 5 year old son would enjoy it . He loves to build and put things together , but this does not hold his interest what so ever . He put 2 of the wheels on and snapped the base together and has not touched it since . The biggest problem I have with this is that it smells like it was stored in a musty/moldy warehouse . The box can be smelled from several feet away and it is not pleasant . It kind of makes me feel like the whole thing is dirty .	-1
I have a 3 1/2 year old son who LOVES to build things . He loves toys that move , and he loves toys that constantly change . When I saw this product , I thought for sure I had a jackpot winner . We had a Groupon , which brought the price down to $ 5 . Had we paid any more than that , we would be a lot more unhappy than we are . $ 5 is even too much , I think.The cheap plastic green base is REALLY hard to put together . Tonight , my husband was attempting to snap the pieces together , and it sliced his thumb , and sliced another finger bad enough that he was bleeding pretty heavily . The connectors & pillars are also REALLY difficult to use . You have to push them really hard to get them on & then when you try to remove them , it 's very difficult . Maybe an older child would be able to , but my toddler ca n't use this toy by himself.We 've had this toy for under a week , and it 's held his interest for maybe five minutes of playtime . Will be donating this to the Goodwill .	-1
We bought this for our 3 year old daughter after reading the positive reviews . Sadly , within a few hours of having this cash register , the drawer would not stay closed . We try to close it , and it latches for a couple of seconds , then springs open on its own . If we had been more proactive , we would have returned this for another brand .	-1
My son loved this toy , but we returned it as the digital display never functioned properly and displayed only gibberish rather than numbers . Sure , I got my money back , but did not appreciate the hassle . Also , the drawer opens so forcefully that money flies out every time ... my son needs no help making messes . Looking at other brands as I 'm very hesitant to buy this product again .	-1
It was cheap- the quality the look . I did n't like it and sent it back right away . It was n't what I was imagining to complete the grocery store I wanted for them .	-1
We love the book in our house so I assumed this would be a GREAT game for the kids . We have played it twice and the second time I could tell the kids were not interested in playing . Pretty boring and disappointing for the $ 18 or so I paid for it .	-1
Best Age : 3Pros : In theory , the game would teach a toddler to wait his/her turn , how to match colors to move along the path , and then the important life lesson about winning/losing and still having fun.Cons : The entire re-design . Totally ridiculous . Do n't waste your money . Go to eBay and get the real thing.As everyone else has probably explained , the original characters from the 80 's are gone . This alone would n't invoke such an awful rating . The problem is they were replaced with extremely intense pictures which are so detailed and huge , that the path has been narrowed and now winds through some new places ( so it is longer and thinner ) . To be honest , I even missed the secret path when I landed on it because the game board is so busy , you ca n't really see where it starts . The enlarged gingerbread men ( and I thought the Katy Perry video totally mocked them , uh yeah - they are fairly accurate in terms of these new creepy ones ) do n't even fit on the micro-spaces that comprise the path . Because the path winds around itself so many times , it is hard to follow , knock your guy an inch and suddenly you are in the next loop of the path and have jumped ahead dramatically . It now takes about double the time to play a game , in part because the path is much longer - but also because the board is harder to follow . It seems it was designed with a deranged teenage girl in mind , not three year olds . You would think they would test these products and do a side-by-side with kids comparing the new one to the old one - hands down , the original would have won.Unfortunately , this is pretty much the only board game for 3 year olds and now it is rendered useless . By the time your child has the dexterity to move his/her piece along this narrow , windy path without being distracted by all the crazy graphics - he or she will realize how babyish this game is and will have moved along to something more challenging.I did actually write to Hasboro directly regarding the above issues , though I doubt they will ever respond .	-1
I had fond memories of playing this game growing up , so I was excited when my kids received it for Christmas . After opening the game , however , I 'm not so excited . They have changed the board from the classic version ; it is much more visually cluttered and Princess Lollypop and Queen Frostine look like Bratz dolls , which I 'm not happy about.. Also , after playing the game as an adult , I realized that it requires no skill whatsoever and is completely a game of chance . Not super educational . I 'll probably end up donating it to the thrift store .	-1
Many adults do n't like playing board games . Why ? Because they think that all board games are more-or-less nothing more than sophisticated versions of Candyland - games which rely on nothing more complicated than random chance.The fact is that random chance does n't make a very interesting game for adults ( unless you 're making bets , I suppose ) , and it does n't make a very interesting game for children either if they 're used to games with more strategy involved . ( My young nieces , for example , *will* ask a lot for Candyland - but only because I am not willing to play it with them very often . ) Some people think that the lack of strategy makes these games easy for young children , and that 's probably true , but it also makes it frustrating for them - they hit a losing streak and they have *no way* to turn it around , and they know that . I have never seen the same frustration with losing in games like Sleeping Queens or Crazy Eights that I have in Candyland - and , tellingly , when my older niece loses Crazy Eights she pouts and then asks to play again . When she loses Candyland , she pouts and puts the game away ! Some chance is good in a game for kids - it levels the game . But I do not think a game that is entirely based on luck is a good idea.Instead of Candyland , I 'd reccommend a game with some level of skill involved - Memory , or Froggy Boogie , perhaps.There is no reason you and your kids have to be resigned to games of capricious fate.Edit : I 've found out why my niece likes this game at all . It 's not for any aspect of the game itself - it 's because when she loses or wins due to chance , we have her `` draw a bedroom '' for herself , or for us . We started doing it because she got too frustrated and upset at losing through no fault of her own .	-1
There are three items* SOMEONE should warn parents about before they buy them . This is one of them . I only wish someone had told ME years ago ... Yes , this game is cute and easy to play . Yes , it 's famous . And yes , it 's probably educational.But be warned - it is THE most boring game in the universe . After ten minutes you will find yourself in a stupor . You 'll look at the board and begin trying to calculate how much time it will take for the game to END . Soon you 'll feel the urge to throw your chair through the window ... not the loving-family-ambience you were expecting.AND EVERY TIME YOU THINK THE GAME IS JUST ABOUT OVER , YOUR KID FALLS DOWN A CHUTE AND HAS TO START OVER ALMOST AT THE BEGINNING . You will find yourself lying to your children , telling them a `` 2 '' means `` Move 4 '' , and secretly scribbling over the chutes at midnight with a fat-tipped indelible black marker while spouting gibberish and drooling.Let your kids play this at pre-school . Give it to the grandparents . JUST DO NOT ALLOW THIS GAME IN YOUR HOUSE IF YOU VALUE YOUR SANITY . *the other two are Candy Land and the book `` The Little Engine That Could ''	-1
I just played this game with my oldest son who is 6 . I felt like we had fallen into in infinite time loop anomaly , and a boring one at that.Where to start ? First , there 's the cheesy cardboard gender specific pieces , and if you have a combination of genders not supported by the pieces , tough . Why not just do something colorful and abstract like other games . Add to that the cardboard stand-up pieces are too tall and continually falling over and getting in the way when opponents are continualy passing each other and landing on the same squares as they are continually reaching for that magic 100 and getting sent down a slide to oblivion only to begin the process again.Then there 's the infinite and tedious gameplay . Move in straight lines back and forth on a mostly featureless board counting up to 100 as you spin a spinner and hope against hope that you get to climb a ladder and avoide a `` chute '' ( which is actually a slide ) .I suppose it 's great if you want to teach a child to count to 100 and keep playing at reaching a goal no matter how much bad luck befalls him or her , but Candyland can do that ( well , not the 100 part but the goal part , and the kids do n't need to know how to count to 100 ) and it 's a lot more fun.The other adults ( my wife and a friend ) that I mention this game to both remember playing it as a child and changing the rules just so the game will finally end . So , what 's the point in this game ? Seriously , this game might have been great in its day , whenever that was , but you 've got a lot more options now . Those kids do n't stay little and cute forever , so why not buy a geniunely fun game to play with them ?	-1
I do n't understand why , but this game has changed since I was a kid . The concept and game play is the same , but the board is terribly laid out . My young children can not figure out which direction to go , and frankly , I have to look very carefully in order to help her . The game takes a long time to play , and often we get confused about direction and such , because the board is so busy and cluttered . I think Chutes and Ladders could use another revamp . I wish it was easier to play , like the version I remember from my own childhood .	-1
I bought this for my son as a first game , and I 've played it with him , as well as his younger sister , who is now 4 years old . I cringe every time they want to play this game . The board is so busy looking , and the slides cover squares that you need to count as you land on or pass by . It 's confusing to kids about which way they 're to go on the board ( first they go left , then they go up , then they go right , etc . ) I constantly have to help them count squares that are covered over by the slides , et al , tell them which direction to go , etc . This is not one of the best counting games out there . Try Hi Ho Cherry-O . MUCH better game !	-1
I know this is a `` classic '' but in this version my almost 5 year old son ( and myself actually ) have trouble following the track . You move from left to right and then when you get to the end of the row you move up one space and then move right to left then on the next row you do the opposite again . The spaces are numbered but it is hard to read and my son obviously can not follow the higher numbers . So you end up going one way and then you slide down and you have to go the other way . It is frustrating for us because we end up getting confused and having to redo the turn because we went the wrong way.The `` water color '' pictures are nice but it is sometimes hard to tell where you are supposed to be.Candyland is much clearer in this sense and my son has a lot of fun with that one .	-1
To many rules to much crap to keep track of , not for children at all . Children just give up and walk off .	-1
The game is kinda fun and my son loves it , but it 's so cheaply built and over priced ! The plastic breaks too easily , nothing sits right and the slightest bump knocks everything out of place . If your kids are n't asking for it , get them something else !	-1
I always enjoyed playing Mousetrap as a kid . The game setup is the same , but the pieces and mechanisms are very flimsy , cheap , and low quality . Parts do not fit on the board very well and the mechanism broke after just a couple of times setting it up . This game is a great example of a company totally sacrificing quality for the bottom line . A once fun game now compromised .	-1
Bought his for my son for xmas . We were disappointed that the game has changed since I was little . Now you build the board as you play the game . As a result we do n't actually play the game . We set the board up and make up our own game .	-1
Well , make sure you open it up right away to ensure it has all the pieces ! Unfortunately our set arrived missing the red bath tub , rendering the entire game useless , and my return window with Amazon has passed . A game like this can not be properly played without every . single . piece . ! ! Fail . We really wanted to & # 34 ; relive childhood & # 34 ; with this game , but I do n't want to order another set since that could be missing its bath tub too ! Way too much hassle for what is apparently a mediocre game based on current reviews , and precious money wasted when the marketplace is filled with honest to God great games . Pass on this one , citizens .	-1
I give this game two stars because my 5 year old son always pulls it out to want to play with it . The game itself is not worth playing , but the construction part can be fun.However , the game pieces are so poorly and cheaply made that I do n't think it is worth anyone 's time to play with it . Not only do the parts NOT fit , but the thin plastic pieces bend and break very easily . My husband got this game because he played with it as a kid , but this particular set does NOT offer the same kind of fun as the old set .	-1
I HATE THIS TOY ! ! ! IT LOOKS SO MUCH FUN BUT HTEN , ONCE YOU BUY IT , IT BREAKS ! ! ! THE TRAPS ARE BROKEN AND THE BOARD GOT SCRATCHED ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! I HATE THIS TOY ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! DO NOT BUY IT ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! !	-1
The pieces are way too small and way too hard to get out of the spaces without making the buzzer go off . My 6 year old does n't find anything fun at all about this game . The pieces get stuck under the game board and are almost impossible to get out . Save your money for something else .	-1
Perhaps it was the nostalgia , perhaps the clever packaging . Whatever compelled me to buy this game , I hope you do not fall prey to the same misguided intention.My kids hate the game . They hate the buzzer , and they hate the tiny parts that get lost in the carpet . They hate the premise . There is no educational value in this game other than learning to count money or learning that specialists get paid exorbitant amounts of money , even more than & quot ; regular & quot ; doctors.Within minutes after we installed the batteries , the red light bulb that serves as a nose no longer worked.I recommend you spend your money and time elsewhere .	-1
We purchased this game for our granddaughter because our kids had it as children and spent hours of giggly fun operating on Sam . We were so very disappointed with the quality of the game . It sure is n't what it used to be . The plastic `` organs '' and `` bones '' slip right off the tweezers when you try to remove them during the `` surgery '' . They could have at least produced some kind of grip edge on them . Also , the tweezers actually throw sparks when they touch the sides of the `` operative sites '' . Coupled with the loud buzz , our granddaughter perceived the was going to be shocked or hurt . Even though we explained that she would n't be . She said , `` I do n't like this game . '' The game board itself is also very cheaply constructed . It 's really a shame that they 've ruined a game that was loads of fun in cutting costs by cheap manufacturing . Sadly , this is another product manufactured outside the USA and it 's become junk !	-1
I wish I had bothered to read the reviews before ordering this game . Paid $ 40 to get the & # 34 ; original & # 34 ; version of this game and instead got the so called updated version which has large holes and rubbish items to take out and that 's it.Applied to return it but could n't without talking to customer service . After explaining the problem she said she would issue a return slip and send the game I had ordered , which by then had gone up an incredible $ 20 to $ 60 . She did agree though I should have it at the original price I ordered it for and was going to issue a $ 20 credit to my account.I presumed the matter was sorted until two days after when I received the exact same game from Amazon . I again could not return the game without talking to customer service but was unable to explain anything more than I wanted to return the game . The fact I still wanted to order the original game did not sink in with the cs agent . The agent merely commiserated with me when I said I still wanted the game and could I get it through Amazon or not as so far it did n't seem likely . The & # 34 ; I understand how you feel & # 34 ; comment I got made me decide to give up , particularly when , as I was chatting with the cs agent I noted that in the last two days the price again had risen by another $ 10.I 've now bought it through Ebay , at least I hope I have . It 's a shame as I never had an unpleasant experience with Amazon before .	-1
We purchased this as part of our classic Christmas - it 's very cheaply put together . The bubble pops , the pieces fit in their slot ... but it 's flimsy ; even the box it is stored in is flimsy and not like other board game boxes.Would not buy another - rather look for a vintage/ better made one .	-1
I bought the 'newer & # 34 ; Trouble and was disgusted by how flimsy and cheaply it was made -- nothing like the one I had as a kid , which is the one pictured in this product ad . This one claimed to be the & # 34 ; classic & # 34 ; Trouble and was $ 20 more , so I bought it , thinking it was what it said it was . However , it is false advertising . I received the same crappy , flimsy , cheap new Trouble board game , where there is a piece of paper that goes over the plastic board peg holders . When you push the number bubble , all the pieces come flying off the board because it is THAT FLIMSY . So you are constantly fixing the pieces and trying to remember where you are in the game . I am returning it immediately . It is FALSELY ADVERTISED . It is NOT WHAT IS PICTURED OR DESCRIBED .	-1
This is what happens when a company decides that they can make much more money by re-making a very popular game as cheaply as possible ( made in china ) and then charging more for it . I ordered the game that is pictured and was willing to pay the $ 20 price tag because my grandkids have one and love it . What I received from School Specialty was & # 34 ; the new and improved & # 34 ; cheaply made version that sells at Walmart for $ 6 . Stay away from this Hasbro disaster .	-1
Make sure you verify which version you will receive before you place your order . I received the newer version of the game that is VERY CHEAPLY made . I searched to find the older one that 's pictured .	-1
After recently purchasing Sleeping Queens and LOVING it , adults and kids included , I started looking into other card-based games , which are perfect for travel . I bought this one based on reviews and because I thought perhaps my 4-year old daugther could easily join in as well , and hid it to be a surprise for a recent vacation.We played it once . It NEVER ends . Like literally , once you get down to two people , I can not see any way this game ever ends . And that sucks . Really , my daughter and I were the last two left , and ended up playing for 20 minutes after everyone else had left , eventually deciding to end and eat ice cream . Such a boring game in general , and it goes on and on and on.Get Sleeping Queens .	-1
I bought this game for my 7 year old son who is crazy for card games , but this was too much . It 's a little complicated at first but my 10 year old started to catch on to the rules and enjoyed it . I would n't recommend it for a child under the age of 9-10 .	-1
Does my 4 year old like it ? Yes . Which is why it gets two stars . The game goes on FOREVER ! I 'm not sure why there are not more complaints about this . The game could last 30 minutes , easily without some creative losing by an adult . I am all for a longer game , but that is not what I look for in a card game for kids . A strategy game , sure . This one is being hidden on the top shelf of the game closet .	-1
I bought this game because the box looked cute and it had won two awards . What a waste of money it was ! It is essentially a game of war - you scream and slam your hand on top of the pile if the cards happen to be flipped over in a certain combination ( two of the same next to each other ( `` a double decker '' ) or two of the same cards on either side of a different card ( `` a slamwich '' ) . There is absolutely no educational value to this game , it 's just a game that will have your kids yelling and arguing about who won a particular slam .	-1
Stratego was introduced in the United States in the early 1960s . Offering strategic elements of chess on a familiar board game motif , it became a very popular game in American households during the 1960s and 70s . By 2000 , no doubt caving to constant reports of how stupid American children were becoming , Hasbro changed the numbering system on the pieces , completely inverting the familiar 1-9 scale . Historically , the most powerful piece ( Marshall ) was marked `` 1 '' while the least powerful piece ( Scout ) was marked `` 9 . '' More recent editions contain pieces marked in the opposite manner , with higher ranked ( i.e. , stronger ) pieces displaying higher numbers . This decision was not met with universal applause , and in response ( or perhaps it was planned all along to generate multiple streams of revenue ? ) , Hasbro released a `` Vintage '' edition . So if you wish to own the same Stratego game you grew up playing , you are forced to find an older game or else purchase the more expensive Vintage edition . Another pitfall for would-be buyers is that Hasbro recently capitalized on the popular fantasy theme , releasing a version of Stratego which replaces the classic Napoleonic army with medieval themed pieces ( i.e. , dragon , dwarf , slayer ) . Confusingly , this version is NOT named Stratego -- the D & D ; Battle or Stratego -- the Fire and Ice Edition or any other moniker that might be helpful in distinguishing among them . Note also that this version also reduced the number of pieces from forty to thirty.To recap , there are three current Hasbro ( Milton Bradley ) offerings . They are all offered on Amazon ( at varying price levels ) and I will cross reference the manufacturer 's part numbers and also provide the relevant links to the games on Hasbro 's Web site , although you can not purchase directly there.====================================================Stratego NostalgiaHasbro Item # 40836 ( See Comments section below for link . ) The Vintage edition ( confusingly titled `` Nostalgia '' by Amazon ) offers the proper ( in my opinion ! ) numbering system , and comes in a keepsake wooden box.====================================================Stratego-Milton Bradley Board GamesHasbro Item # 04714 ( See Comments section below for link . ) The basic Stratego ( post-2000 ) edition offers the proper number of pieces ( 40 ) but the inverted ranking system . This last and most important point is not obvious until you scrutinize the Product Details . ( `` This new , updated version of Stratego is slightly different than the original , though the gameplay is the same . '' ) Plus you need to apply the stickers yourself ! Ouch , Hasbro cheaped out.====================================================StrategoHasbro Item # 45068 ( See Comments section below for link . ) The fantasy-themed version with 30 pieces . Again , Amazon has failed to adequately label the game , simply titling it `` Stratego . '' However the Product Features make it clear . ( `` Choose to lead warriors from an ancient arctic realm or a fierce army from a land of fiery molten lava . `` ) ====================================================Your best bet ? If you simply want the same game you grew up playing , just look for a cardboard boxed set from the 70s or 80s . For example , this version ( Stratego - The Classic Game of Battlefield Strategy 1986 Edition ) is the same one I have . I have owned it for many years with no complaints . Finding one for yourself , however , might be trickier than you think . Unless you buy it here from a Amazon Marketplace vendor -- which is not recommended , given the ridiculous prices -- you are left to your own devices to find it in a used game store or at a garage sale . Alternatively , you can buy one of the currently offered versions . But as I have demonstrated , they are not all the same as one another , and indeed very few are identical to what you may have grown up playing.P.S . After much further research , I believe either of these two sets ( Stratego Vintage Wood Book Edition ) or ( Library Stratego Game Set ) are equivalent to the Vintage edition described above , and at least one may be available inexpensively at Target .	-1
Half the reviews for this product are 5 star , half are 1 star . I decided to take the chance . I wanted something that would help me relearn my math facts and that would grow with my daughter as she begins to learn them . This sounded like the best one on the market and sadly , I still think that . So what 's wrong with it ? The numbers are not very dark so it is difficult to read it in both dim conditions and in bright light . Forget using it in a car.In addition , the numbers are poorly formed . They are similar to some calculators , where the numbers are made up of straight lines but that 's not the problem . The problem is that the lines have fairly large spaces between them which make the numbers oddly formed . When combined with how dim they are , it makes them quite difficult to read.The buttons barely work . You have to hit them firmly and check the display to make certain that your button hit was seen before moving on to the next number you want to enter . This is annoying for an adult but nearly impossible for a very young child to remember or accept . I also figured it was a matter of days before some of the buttons stopped working entirely.Another minor problem is the LED 's on the front are incredibly bright , actually painful to look at . A quick swipe of a black sharpie on the light itself would fix it but I figured there was no point . After trying it out for over a week , I sent it back . In case you are wondering , I ended up searching for an old DataMan - a similar toy from the 80 's .	-1
This toy is so expensive and yet so cheaply made . They break easily and do n't work well . For these steep prices ( $ 40 ) you can so much more for your money than this thing .	-1
I have many thinkfun game , and this is the least of my favor . It is too difficult even for an adult and answer key is not that easy to follow at all ! Not recommend !	-1
I bought 2 of these for my 2 kids for christmas ( 20 months and 3 1/2 ) my husband and i were really excited cause they were the big santa gift . We bought them plastic license plates with their names on them . We waited ti ; 2 nights before christmas to put these together because we did n't have a place to hide 2 of these . Good thing we did n't wait til christmas eve like we were planning ( i was paranoid they might be missing a piece ) Well , they were n't missing any pieces . the first one took my husband and i , ( together ) over an hour to put together . The instructions are the worst thing i 'd ever seen . There are NO words and you ca n't even understand the pictures ; They skip steps and expect you to know what to do . After we finally got through the first we were ready to tackle the second . Well , it was faster . 15 minutes in we were on like the second to last step , and two of the pieces would not fit together . We tried everything . Frustrated , I woke up at 6am christmas eve morn to go to walmart to exchange . Guess what , i had the exact same problem . Returned again , and they were out . Went to toysrus and the SAME THING . Okay now i 'm peeved . ( my husband had been from square one ) then finally got another and it worked . My daughter is actually almost too big for it ( ages go up to 5 ) shes 3 1/2 and small for her age . hers does n't get any use and my son will sit in it and turn the wheel , but not move his feet because they get stuck under his seat . i bought them the matching gas pump and my son loves to put gas in his and his sisters car , but still they never actually get 'driven . '	-1
I wish this game had more pieces . I bought it for my 3 year old son at Christmas and there are n't very many pairs of puzzles . My son did n't even have to look very hard to find matches . The game does n't last us very long playing . He does n't learn anything from it which is a little disappointing .	-1
This concept is a great for little kids . Personally I think it is geared towards ages 2-4 yrs . Problem is , there are only so many pieces and it took my daughter 2 times to memorize the game . She was 3 and I found it too easy for her . She loves I Spy but this game is n't worth it . Get the momory game instead	-1
The top is brightly colored and was able to spin easily . However , the suction cup on the bottom did not work and was useless . After about 3 weeks of use , the handle broke and I was not able to repair the top . Yes the top did provide the stimulation it advertised but the durability of the product is greatly lacking .	-1
These bathtub fingerpaints colors are not nearly as vibrant as the two different bathtub crayons I also purchased and not nearly as much fun for my 20 month old . He loves to write on himself and the tub with the crayons but the paints are much too thin to really even see .	-1
The paints just do n't work . Do n't stay on the tub . Can not really draw with them . Disappointed in this bath time toy .	-1
This product is weakly colored bubble bath , not fingerpaint at all . My two year olds were very disappointed that when they tried to draw on the walls , they could n't see what they were drawing . They were confused and needed to dump out an entire bottle in their hand to spread on the wall in order to see anything . Then because it was all used up , they cried because there was n't any more . The palette is worthless because you ca n't hold enough `` paint '' in any of the fingers to be able to see anything when painted . The consistency is like bubble bath or shampoo , so in other words , runny and not a good material to use for painting . The kids could n't even make hand prints ! On the plus side , it did not stain my walls or grout . Not that I would expect it to ... because there is n't enough pigment !	-1
These paints are more soap than paint . When your fingers are wet the paints slide right off them , so it 's extremely difficult to a : get them on your fingers to begin with and b : apply them to any surface at all . They have barely any pigment and do n't stick to the side of the tub . Do n't waste your money .	-1
This paint set is meant to be used in the bath tub by a preschool aged child . It is completely useless unless the palette , the child 's hands , and the wall are COMPLETELY dry . If there is any wetness the paints are too runny to work . Who would expect a preschool child to go through such lengths to paint with a product that is SUPPOSED to be used in the BATHTUB ? ? ? It is like painting with water or disappearing ink.If you use a dry paintbrush on a dry surface with paint from a pallette being held by dry hands you get almost acceptable colors.Since I can not find the company 's website , I plan to write them a letter of complaint to the address on the box . What a waste of money .	-1
The original Rush Hour is still much more fun . The only reason I had to buy this is my son is such a train freak . The puzzles are not as challenging overall , yet the difficulty level is a bit uneven in the four categories ( junior , beginner , intermediate , advanced ) . Also , the build quality is poorer , as a few of the train pieces do n't sit properly on the board , and the colors on the train pieces do not match those printed on the puzzle cards , a sore point for a young boy .	-1
This thing is freaky . I bought one for my son and one night last week I woke up and it was on my nightstand and the crank was turning itself and then all of a sudden the clown popped up ! It scared the crap outta me . Avoid this at all costs .	-1
I bought this for my 1 year old , not really paying attention to the age suggestion . It is NOT appropriate for a one year old . My 3 and 5 year old love it and my 1 year old does enjoy watching it . It needs to have the song finish before Jack can go back down which is frustrating for kids until they understand what that means . I have seen some of the paint chip and the edges of the box have a few dents already . For the price everyone is listing it for , they 're ripping you off . For the price I paid ( $ 3.99 ) , it 's a good buy.EDIT : Ours died in late summer . It just stopped working . No music , no popping up . Nothing . I am so glad I did n't pay full price for this . Maybe we got a bum toy but as far as I 'm concerned , between the paint chipping and it breaking , it is pretty much a cheap toy . I would not recommend this product .	-1
I bought this for my daughter and she really liked the idea of it , but it never really worked very well . Often times , Jack would pop out the box without warning and getting him back in was always a hassle . The clip is supposed to hold him inside when the song ends , but it did n't alawys secure Jack in the box . Eventually , the clip broke and fell in the box and now Jack is permanently out the box . I contacted the manufacturer because I thought we may have rec 'd a defective model , but they ignored me . My daughter is not rough with her toys at all- she takes very good care of them , so I have to assume this is a cheap toy and a waste of money .	-1
Expensive and a little bit of a scam , with the mail in voucher for the caterpillars , PLUS $ 5 additional shipping charge . Do not recommend .	-1
The butterfly net was fine . But , it would of been better if we actually could get the butterflies ! The Insect Lore company is TERRIBLE with customer service ... absolutely horrible . I tried 5 times -- no joke ! -- to get the free caterpillars per the coupon that came in the butterly net package . And 5 times was told to leave a message for customer service -- no one ever called me back . And , 5 times was disappointed and left frustrated and angry that I could n't get anyone to filful my order . I originally ordered the caterpillars online but for some reason my order did n't go through right . So , I got a letter in the mail saying to call or mail in payment again . I wanted to call thinking it would be easiest that way and 5 times got nothing . My daughter was sad over this because she so badly wanted it . Oh , and at the final attempt , I asked the person on the phone who could n't help me AGAIN and advised that I leave ANOTHER message for customer service that Insect Lore did a big promotional campaign and because of that could n't handle all the calls coming in for ordering -- three words for Insert Lore : Not My Problem . If you say you sell something then sell it and treat your customers right because now , they lost me as a customer forever . So , buyer beware ... if you want those free caterpillars get ready for headaches . I finally gave up and returned the net .	-1
I must say I was very disappointed to receive this product only to find that the larvae do n't ship with the product ! If you go directly to the website insectlore.com you can buy gardens that ship with the larvae ... so you get it all at once . I 'm disappointed we have to pay an additional $ 5 now to get the larvae , and it will take an extra 3-7 business days ... UGH ! My daughter 's birthday is in 3 days , guess we 'll only be able to give her half of this present . Very very very disappointed . I wish I 'd just gone directly to insectlore and bought from them .	-1
There are lots of positivie reviews about this toy , which you can refer to hear all the good things this toy has to offer . Here are the I do n't like about it:1 . It 's makes noise that is appealing to children but very annoying to the adults in our family.2 . There is no place within the toy to store all the gears and pieces that come with it , so they end up easily separated and strewn around and lost easily.UPDATE : This toy lasted two and a half months before the motor that turns the gears broke and the toy stopped working for good .	-1
It takes up a lot of space , without being much fun.The rings break apart too easily , which frustrates the little kid . Plus , they do n't whistle easily ... also frustrating a little kid .	-1
We received this as a gift , and the idea sounded cute . HOWEVER , you have to wack the dolphins really hard to get them to make any noise . Also , the rings are nearly impossible for a 2-year-old to put together , and they fall apart almost immediately . We never use it in the bathtub ... it 's too frustrating and takes up quite a bit of room . My son did like it in his wading pool . But it 's basically just another floating toy .	-1
did n't stay linked in a ring , difficult to keep the appropriate amt of water in them to make them whistle . We tossed them .	-1
We were looking forward to this but it just does not deliver . The dolphins do n't make sound reliably and the darn rings will not stay hooked together . It is going into the Christmas return pile if I can find the box among the recyclables .	-1
I actually found these at home goods for [ ... ] ... well I am glad I did not pay more than [ ... ] ... First off the colors of the dolphins were all messed up..they did n't match their tubes ... When I mean they did n't match ... they put in whacky colors like red/orange colored dolphin but a yellow tube ( no yellow dolphin ) then we got two of the same colored dolphins . Okay..so the colors were n't a huge deal I suppose but then the dolphins would n't whistle ... that 's totally useless ... and as someone else mentioned the links do n't stay linked . HUGE disappointment !	-1
I swear by the reviews on Amazon.com , but unfortunately I did not read them before purchasing . Our 4th son just turned 1 , and celebrated his 2nd Christmas . I just bathed him and put the dolphins in with him ... .believe what you read . The rings do not stay together and the dolphins really do n't sing ! ! If you tap the tops of the head , nothing happens ; if you lift the dolphin out of the water and slightly & quot ; smack & quot ; the water with it , it will make a noise . Quite frankly it works better if you blow into the dolphin . The baby got a kick out of the toy for a short time . Maybe I 'll keep it just because he can dunk the dolphins and toss them around . Also , this toy takes up lots of room ! ! I gave it 4 stars for durability since it does seem pretty sturdy .	-1
There is a reason most of these reviews are one star this toy does n't even deserve 1 star all I can say is loved the ideal , did n't love the toy please save your money and PASS	-1
We got these for our daughter becasue she loves bath time and playing her toy piano . We figured this would be a cute toy that she would enjoy but we were wrong . You have to beat the poor dolphins to get them to play a note . And the note is more of an electronic sound ... it 's hard to describe it but it 's NOT a musical note ! And it never fails after fianlly beating the things enough to get a sound out of them the ring comes loose . It 's just a total pain to use . Granted she still plays with them in the tub just we could have bought a cheap bag of plastic dolphins at the aquarium and saves 3/4 of the money we spent on this set .	-1
This toy is supposed to be for babies and toddlers and yet it does n't have any of the features one would expect in a young child 's toy.One would expect color , ease of use , softness , and purpose . The only qualification that the Water Symphony Tub matches is that the dolphins and the rings are colorful.Which brings me to the question of who on earth thought that making the rings so hard to connect was a good idea . As a mom , I usually have other chores at bath time other than ring rangler . And then there is the hardness factor . The dashboard of my car is softer . A little more built-in teething satisfaction would have been nice.Two stars . The dolphins do make noise but not often enough . They are hard enough that a baby can hurt their gums on them , or *you* or a sibling if they are thrown . One plus is that they do n't seem to mildew .	-1
I was excited about the idea of a little toy for my 19-month old that made music in the tub . From the description of the toy , you 'd think that 's what this was . First of all , tapping the dolphins on the head makes either a ridiculous whistling noise that can barely be called a note , if it works at all . Most of the time , they do n't really work at all . And , as stated in other reviews , the ring does NOT stay together in the tub , making it hard to keep track of them and play any kind of `` song '' whatsoever . That being said , it 's a cute toy if you 're just looking for a brightly colored , floating tub toy , and for that purpose , my daughter likes it . Just do n't expect it to be much else .	-1
My son received this toy as a Christmas gift , and we were disappointed with it . Once out of the box , we were frustrated with the number of small parts , such as the tiny plastic balls which are used in the loader . These could be considered a choking hazard for younger children . Also , there is very little room for `` hands on '' play . The trains merely move around the track by themselves . My son became very frustrated with this and wanted to push the trains himself . I had to tell him that he would break it if he pushed them . I recommend that you purchase one of the excellent Thomas wooden train sets . They are much better than this set and allow for much more interactive play .	-1
My son received this as a gift and given that the toy wo n't stay together well or run right without adult guidance , he found the toy difficult and frustrating . He was interested at first in watching it but when he tried to play along , it would then fall apart and become a problem . The little balls are so easy to lose and though he loves the ball part of the toy , it is not safe for me to put in the play room since his baby sister will certainly swallow one . I think that is a hazard unless you have only one child in your family who is responsible ( or old enough ) not to put the balls into their mouth . Ifyou have younger children who share the play room , this is not a good toy to have around.I plan to ask the relatives who bought it to return it to the store .	-1
This toy was very dissapointing for my son who loves Thomas toys and the show . It is poorly made , do not mistake it for the other train sets of Thomas that you are used to . This is a cheaper version , and the wooden cars will not work with this track . I do not mind that it is plastic , what I do mind is that it does not work . It did not even last 1 hour with my son and I before it was completely unusable . The pieces were poorly made , do not fit together properly , and do not work . Keep looking for a better Thomas set .	-1
This is a great toy until you open the box and try to put it together . The tracks are difficult to put together and then stay together . They come apart when played with . It took me a long while to finally get the whole track together . Then a couple seconds into playing with it , it is apart again.I recommend if you want a Terrific train set get the GEOTRAX sets . They are easy durable and lots of fun to look and play with . Also anyone including your child can rearrange the tracks with easy . DON '' T GET THIS ONE > > > > > > > > > > >	-1
This was a completely frustrating and disappointing toy . Once Thomas , Percy and Terence have done their thing a couple of times , there is nothing else to see . Small parts like the `` coal '' marbles are dangerous in a house with a crawling baby and the box even says `` keep long hair away from moving parts '' ! ! Yikes ! ! Took forever to assemble , five minutes to watch , one minute to pack away . Do n't waste your money .	-1
Thomas and his friends , Percy and Terence , they load , fill , scoop , haul , and dump their cargo of `` rocks '' around this bustling construction site . The vehicles move backward or forward , it is automatic when your child chooses which area the engines will go to next . A chute that dumps the load of rocks into Percy 's tender and Terence will load Thomas with rocks.It was fun to look at for the first 30 mins but then my 30 months old son gets tired of it . There is no hands on interaction except controlling the loader to go forward or backward . I do n't think it is a good , stimulating toy for my son ! ! !	-1
Poor quality , not well balanced . Looked like the original gyroscope I still owned from years ago , however , after a couple of demonstrations to show the Grandkids , the soldered seam broke . Very disappointed . I would try another brand . It is a good teaching tool for the kids .	-1
really ? My son did n't care for . He played a bit and I thought he would keep playing but he has not touched since we got it and the only time he played . I think it should have some type of sound to catch kids attention and keep them interacting/entertained .	-1
I bought this for my oldest son because he is interested in learning addition and subtraction . He has only used it four or five times . He gets frustrated that his finger covers the answer and the plastic is so thick it is hard to read anyway . I remember using this toy when I was young and I thought the manufacturers would have developed a better product since materials have changed so much in the past twenty years .	-1
My mom bought this toy foor my son for Christmas last year ( 2010 ) . My son is just about 2 1/2 now . I wanted a jack in the box so that my son could work on his motor skills and oppositional skills . He loves being surprised too . For the 11 months that we have owned this toy my son still ca n't crank the handel . I myself find it kind of awkward to do so . The toy is cute and has n't broken ( yet ) . The star on the front turns and clicks . My 4 month old loves when I turn it . The button for the squeaker on the back is kind of hard to push ( for me ) . My two year old has n't tried playing with the button because it 's so hard to push ( he has other toys that squeak when you push them and he can do it just well ) .So , in conclusion , because the toy is so awkward and hard ( for a child ) to manipulate our toy has been not much more than space taking up my kids ' toy box .	-1
`` Jack '' does n't pop up after only a few weeks of owning it . Do n't waste your money .	-1
I was excited to find this toy because it uses the winding motion of a jack-in-the-box but is sized for little fingers . LIke all the Tolo toys we have , it is bright and colorful , but we seem to have gotten a defective unit . The little man pops up in the middle of the song ( & # 34 ; This Old Man & # 34 ; ) instead of at the end . Frustrating . I notice also that our 2yo has trouble pushing the little man back down -- he wo n't stay . I can do it , but it takes a delicate touch , something toddlers do NOT have . In addition , the squeaky button on the side is hard for little hands to push , and even in big hands it sometimes squeaks , sometimes not . If it worked right it might be good , but as it is we are disappointed , and ca n't recommend it .	-1
Altho I love the looks of this toy ( bright colors ) it is n't very engaging . For one , it takes too long to wind the toy to where the clown pops up . I think it 's a cute addition to my grandson 's toy box , but as far as entertaining him ... it does n't .	-1
I bought this thinking it would be great way to teach kids their multiplication but it is n't the case . When you press down on the buttons you can hardly see the answers . I remember them being a lot brighter . Very disappointed .	-1
The first day owning this toy my daughter suggested from the back seat that there was an error in the facts . Sure enough , the top left button , which should read 1x1 = 1 , in fact reads 1x2 = 1 . The button to its right does read correctly , 1x2 = 2 . My 8 year old caught the mistake . I 've posted pictures above to show you this error.As other reviewers have stated , the answers can be difficult to see . The translucent buttons are a little too opaque for easy reading . At least my children 's fingers are smaller than mine and they are able to move them out of the way to see the answer . Also , the fact is simply painted on top to rub off with repeated use . I also posted a picture to demonstrate the view of the answers.We 'll have to exchange this item for one of better quality .	-1
Bought this for my five yo who plays it in his class.The overall compostion of the game is so cheap . It is like it was made on a copy machine . The cards are paper thin , and will not last over time . After setting up the game , many of the cards were already bent.Next thing is that the directions are somewhat complicated . Maybe I 'm impatient , but I just did not get it.There are so many other games that are truly educational and that are well made . I 'm just not sure that this is one of them .	-1
We 've had the game for almost a year and we 've only played it when it arrived . Frankly , my 5 year old daughter and I did n't find it as much fun or as stimulating as expected based on the positive reviews . Main complaint is that the pieces are INCREDIBLY flimsy ( has a home made feel ) and one has to manage that aspect instead of fully focusing on the important things . My secondary complaint is that the game is barely more involved than the basic memory card games that cost much less and no where near as challenging as Zoombinis software , which we love . So , this game is not much fun , not well made , not very stimulating , yet it carries a relatively high price - avoid it !	-1
My family adores this game , and going by the many 4 and 5 star reviews many people do as well . It is basically rummy with a fifth suit and you play a whopping thirteen rounds with 3 cards for 3 to 13 for King . Your hand number each round doubles as that round 's wild card number in addition to the Jokers.That said , if you like strategy and resource management , you will never find them here . It is good for children but adults would do best starting on round 7 or so , because it is lots of arranging sets and runs until it is your turn to draw a card or grab an old one hoping the last player dropped a good card you need.I recommend any other game over this one , starting with Fluxx , which at least has rules changes to keep interest going .	-1
I played this game with my eight and nine year old kids . I am impressed how quickly they caught on to the complicated rules that change slightly every round of the game . Basically , there are 11 ( ! ! ) rounds in this game , and each round , another card is & # 34 ; wild & # 34 ; and each round the size of the hand increases by one card . You ca n't play this game without a pen , paper , and perhaps even a calculator at the end to tally up the scores.What annoyed me the most was the length of the game . Eleven rounds is veeeeeeeery long . And I paid $ 11-12 dollars for what is basically a deck of cards . They 're not like a deck of normal cards , because they have 5 suits and are missing the 1 's and 2 's but they are just paper and ink and some instructions . They should have been half that price . I ca n't really see my family playing it again , as I ca n't really include my younger kids and they wo n't be patient for the hour it will take us to finish this game .	-1
My family ( sister , mom , husband + me ) and I love Phase 10 . We 're avid card players and do well with complex games . Phase 10 is something we always carry with us on our holidays.Five Crowns is just not for us - its just not challenging enough . We got bored in a few rounds and went back to Phase 10 .	-1
I did n't realize this was so flimsy. , I thought it would be on a sturdy base . The pegs do not stay in place , therefore the shapes fall off as the pegs come out of othe holes in the base . I should have returned the item , but I did n't want to pay the return shipping and out littlel one plays with it as is . I do not like this toy ,	-1
My daughter is 18 months old and takes this toy apart every time she plays with it . She pulls the pegs out and puts them in her mouth . Then she tosses the shapes everywhere . Not exactly a sorter ! Just a mess . Save your money !	-1
The package did not mention that it was a choking hazard for children under 3 ! ! ! I plan to complain to the manufacturer . Its definitely a hazard if your child is still teething -- my 19 mo son who still likes to chew up stuff decimated a piece . I luckily fished out the red star in four pieces from his mouth before he could swallow and get into any trouble.So while I no longer give the toy to him , I plan to once he is over the chewing stage since he loved fitting the pegs back , and stacking and sorting and it definitely kept him educationally engaged . 3 stars on the durability since while he can chew it up , its an engaging toy , and my friends 3 yr olds enjoy the toy too . Also , Lauri replaces pieces for [ a nominal fee . ]	-1
We love `` SET '' and were excited to play `` Quiddler . `` We found the rules to be absurdly complex . We also found that playing by the rules was not much fun.Just to explain - Quiddler is just a deck of cards with letters and point values on them ( and they are beautifully illustrated ) - it 's a no brainer that you can just deal out cards and see who can make the most words , or the highest point words - it 's basically like a deck of Scrabble cards . And , the game is fun if you play this way.For us , the problem was trying to follow the written directions/rules included with the game - we found them to be absurdly complicated and really not that fun . We wound up just playing by our own rules . We enjoyed it mildly , but would probably rather play Bananagrams or Scrabble.This was only our first time playing so , if our opinion changes , I 'll update this review . For now though , it 's a weak 2 stars .	-1
The only interaction is that during your play/turn you get to chance to choose from the discard pile and only the card that the person before discarded . It 's also too easy to make words and go out , two rounds is the norm ; and the larger the word made means nothing extra . The high review average for this game says something about the people posting reviews in general .	-1
This is another that the kids all want when they see the commercial . It looks like it would be a blast . Do n't bother . It 's just not fun . It 's hard for kids to get the ice cubes in right & the little hammers are junk . With very little use , a couple of ours actually broke.I either put this away permanently or I threw it away . I ca n't remember which.This is junky garbage.Do n't buy this .	-1
I got this game cause I remembered playing it when I was younger and just loved it . So I got it for my kids . I put all the ice in and then realized it did n't come with the big block of ice for the bear to sit on . Still waiting for Hasbro to send us a big block.. otherwise whats the point in playing the game .	-1
I have a 3 year old and it can be difficult to find games that are n't too difficult for her but still fun for the rest of us . My kids , ages 6 and 3 , were totally excited to play this game as was I until we discovered that you spend more time putting the cubes into the frame than you do actually playing . It 's a real pain to put all the little ice blocks in the frame and honestly the last row of blocks is too difficult for the kids . Then , all the kids do is take turns hammering out cubes until the bear falls . My kids seem of pretty average intelligence and this game provided almost no challenge to them or even learning as far as I could tell . They both knew exactly when the bear would fall and that 's really only fun once or twice . I think we played it about four times in the past year . I hate to be down on any kind of game that brings the family together or gets kids involved in something away from the tv/computer , but this game is just annoying to set up and dull to play .	-1
This game fails to hold interest for my three and five year old girls.It 's a classic and they 're still excited to play when we bring it out , but they tire within two rounds , which only last about 30 seconds each . Left to their own , they would just like to pound all the ice cubes out as fast as possible , but since it takes a minute or so for an adult to setup , it 's not really fun for anyone . There 's never any surprise or challenge as to which cube will cause the bear to fall , so it basically feels like a complicated plastic tic-tac-toe game . On our set , the plastic is poorly finished , so the bear does n't stand/skate in the slot he 's meant to . Perhaps it 's better to wait till they are old enough for Operation or Kurplunk . For now , PopUp Pirate is the family favorite . If you have other suggestions , please leave a comment .	-1
My 9 year old , 6 year old and 4 year old played with this game twice and was bored . It 's very predictable . I thought as boys , they 'd enjoy hammering the & # 34 ; ice & # 34 ; . There 's not much physical or mental skill required .	-1
I bought this game after reading so many postive reviews.It is cheaply made and just no point to it unless you are a frustrated person who wants to hammer the same cube and make alot of noise.Wish I could understand why so many reviewers liked it so much.Someone enlighten me so I do n't feel I wasted the money .	-1
I love this toy , but I 'm not sure about my 9 month old daughter . She is still learning how to use it and is more interested in chewing on the pieces . She does like to watch me dump the pieces out and put them back in . I like it because it 's nice and simple and does not require batteries .	-1
There are much cuter shape sorters available that also may be more fun . I always had to coax my kids to play with this , its not all that appealing , but I like the choice of nine shapes and it is a good way for a child to learn those shapes . A good feature is the lid snaps shut which means pieces dont get lost in the toy box . Little ones will need help opening it though .	-1
If you look at the reviews on this toy , you 'll see that they skip 6 years between 2002 and 2008 ! ! What 's with that ? ? Just reading the first reviews before I ordered , I thought I was getting a shape sorter with 18 shapes ! Well those were the people that gave it 5 stars ... ... .back in 1999 . The latest positive reviews are mostly from people who ordered this and are excited because they 'll be getting the same toy for their grandchildren that they remember having years ago . ( in other words they had n't received it yet when reviewing ) Well this is n't that toy ! Playskool has cheapened it up BIG TIME . It only has 9 shapes now , amazon should really remove the reviews here that pertain to a totally different toy ! I would have never ordered it had I skipped back several pages in the reviews to find the truth ! Having the # 1 review be from 1999 is a little misleading ! ! Also the shapes are cheap and hollow with only the top being solid , and the bottom is & # 34 ; open & # 34 ; to the hollow interior . ( not shown in any pics , misleading again ) The entire thing is just cheap junk now with not enough shapes to make it stand out from other nicer shape sorters out there . Would NOT recommend this toy unless Playskool gets a clue and starts making the 18 shapes people are expecting .	-1
When my niece was younger ... about 10 years ago I bought her this toy , it was fun and included lots of shapes.I recently purchased this now for my 6m old and to my surprise it only has 9 shapes ! Holy cost reduction ! ! I liked this toy for the storage of all the pcs , they just stay inside and usually wont fall out.The color is kind of blah now too ... Look for other shape sorters that do the same thing but offer more pcs , you 're going to need them as they get lost VERY easily !	-1
I bought this for my son for [ $ ] knowing that playskool was a pretty good brand..I was wrong about this toy . The top comes off even if you barely touch it..so my son just puts them in the big opening..that dosent teach much..I wouldnt purchase it for anyone and I will look for a new shape sorter for my son .	-1
Please feel free to read this review in its entirety , or save yourself some time and avoid this version of Monopoly and buy the `` Monopoly - Classic '' version instead . While it is about double the price , it is the game you know and love . The less expensive version ( reviewed here ) is a piece of garbage.I regret this purchase . If you grew up playing Monopoly , you would be much , much better off buying `` classic '' or a used version . There are several major issues with this version , as well as some minor ones . If you buy this to teach your children one of the most beloved games of your childhood and a part of Americana , you are apt to be disappointed.The major issues involve quality and design . The board itself no longer folds in two . It is cut to fold into quarters and barely sits level on a table . I do not hold out much hope it will last very long . The property cards are flimsy , made smaller than in the past , as well as being thinner . The Chance and Community Chest cards are also of poor quality , much thinner than their predecessors , and take on color changes , now being blue/white and orange/white , instead of the familiar yellow and orange , respectively.The money is a big concern as well . The money is thin and there are not enough slots provided to use money in the bank during play , or to store after gameplay , and in fact there are raised areas in the plastic money tray which prevent the money from even sitting in the spaces . The raised areas are somewhat random and follow no logical pattern . So forget using the box/tray component for the bank during a game or storing money neatly . The tray is essentially useless . I have no idea what Hasbro/Parker Brothers was thinking here , and apparently neither did they.The minor issues are some game changes : The money is different color and handed out in different amounts . Very minor , yes , but now you have to get used to $ 10 being blue ( used to be the $ 50 ) as well as some other color changes . You are also starting the game with different amounts of money . Also the Income Tax space is now a flat $ 200 instead of `` 10 % or $ 200 '' , and Luxury Tax is $ 100 , no longer $ 75 . Again , these are minor but worth noting.I would avoid this cheaply made version . At the very least this should be advertised as what it is - `` revamped Monopoly . ''	-1
There is nothing worse than a game in which the winner is often obvious in the first 10 minutes but lasts another hour and fifty minutes . If your oppoent lands on premium spaces on his first two trips around the painfully monotonous board and you do not , well , you are screwed . Monopoly enthusiasts insist it is more than just rolling the dice ; important decisions are involved . Do you buy the property or not ? Well , let me help you with that : If you have the money ... then yes . There , decision made . I really do not see how marching your token around the same dull board in the same direction over and over and over again for what could be easily two or even more hours would qualify for anyone as fun . Some may say `` you just are n't patient . '' Balonie . Ive played many other games that have lasted for well over two hours . The difference is that those games have more interesting and varied decisions and planning to be done . You are not the victim of dice . ( Dice are not always bad . There ARE some games out there that utilize dice far better than Monopoly and do manage to tie the outcome of the dice to actual decisions in a more balanced way . ) But Monopoly just does not have anywhere near the mechanic needed to justify a game taking this long . I 've heard enthusiasts say it is a great way for kids to develop their math skills . Even that argument is weak because there are far better games out there that can help with those skills . I would suggest Ticket To Ride for starters . That is a game that takes about an hour , easy to learn , has some luck involved , but much more planning and decision making to keep it engaging . Saying that Monopoly is the worst game of all time may be stretching the truth a bit , but not by much .	-1
I received the 2013 edition of the game not the regular version that I ordered . The 2013 edition only has 12 pieces not the 16 expected and some other & # 34 ; fire and Ice & # 34 ; tokens for giving & # 34 ; special powers & # 34 ; or something . Definitely not what I wanted . Sent it back and ordered the Classic version just to make sure I got the right game .	-1
. . .but I just ca n't get excited by this game.I learned how to play & quot ; Monopoly & quot ; at the age of 5 . My eldest son learned how to play at 8 . My kids enjoy the real game . They do n't enjoy the & quot ; kids & quot ; version.Kids are brighter than most adults give them credit for . The original game is a wonderful teaching tool on a number of levels . I do n't see the point in & quot ; dumbing down & quot ; when it is not necessary.Parents , teach your children how to play the REAL GAME . Then , there can be some valuable family time . The adults will too quickly get bored with this version -- and frankly , so will the kids.Do n't waste your time or money .	-1
My daughter was so excited when Santa brought her this game for Christmas , but she lost interest in about 15 minutes . It takes forever to & # 34 ; Wake Up Daddy & # 34 ; . Very disappointing	-1
This is a nice idea for helping children to become more familiar with the alphabet and words and spelling , but there is one huge drawback . The game uses only capital letters . Children are not typically going to see EGG written , but egg . They wo n't see NEST , but nest . My older two children ( when 4 and 2 ) used to try to match up the dice with the cards on their own ( no rolling , just turning the dice to find the letters ) , and thought it was fun . But , it did n't translate to them recognizing the words in other contexts . It could n't , because the game uses all uppercase letters , whereas in real-life lowercase is used.It also is often difficult to get the letters you need to finish the word , since there are a limited number of dice with lots of letters . You can spend a lot of time just rolling and rolling and rolling , waiting for the right letter to come out . That 's frustrating for little children.Considering the capital letter drawback , the gameplay issue , and that the game is basically heavy-duty cardboard flashcards with several dice , I would pass on this game .	-1
My husband & I love to play boggle so we were excited to find boggle jr to share with our kids . We could n't even finish playing one time . This is not a game . You do n't roll the dice or play in any way . This is a `` learning '' activity , but it is n't fun at all . I am very disappointed in this .	-1
I should have listened to other reviewers . This is nothing more than a set of colorful flashcards . Do n't waste money on this game .	-1
I never cared for this game , I always thought it was silly and really did n't offer much in the way of strategy or skill.I ca n't think of anything really good to say about it , but I know it 's been around for some time , so some people must get into it . If you like strategy and logic or word games like I do , you 'll probably want to pass on this one .	-1
Everything about this game was made more complicated for the 2000 's set ... the board , the gameplay , even the little people pegs are harder to get in the vehicles . Clean-up is not a snap , as there are more confusing pieces . Despite trying three times and following the directions , I still can not get the cover to stay on/be flush with the box bottom . Shoot , I ca n't even follow the general directions for this game . Get the middish-80 's verison in order to have a fun time . Hey , when I play a game , I am trying to escape the reality of life , not re-live it through cardboard and cheap plastic .	-1
My granddaughter , who is 10 , and I love playing this game ; it is updated from the one I used to play when I was a child . I had previously ordered one from another retailer to have at my house for all the kids to play and later ordered this for a 10-year-old girl for a charity at church . I was very disappointed to get a game box with a hole cut out for the spinner and the whole game looks & # 34 ; cheap & # 34 ; next to the one I bought for the house . I will switch them out but recommend you shop around before buying this one .	-1
My 9 year old daughter wanted this for Christmas . Now , I am one to research everything . However , I played this game as a child so I did not think researching was necessary . Well I was wrong . This game is awful . Why they felt the need to mess up a classic I dont know . There are 6 pages of rules to go by . Confusing ones at that . We didnt make it 1/4 of the way through before we gave up , it was that difficult . I am also a teacher and normally I would just donate this to my classroom but not this time . I like my students enough not to subject them to this awful game . Like others I am going to look for the classic version .	-1
If you have ever played the earlier version of life please do yourself a favor and avoid this `` new '' version like the blak plague . My friends and I used to play the old version every single day up to late hours . Once we learned the new version was out we ran and bought it . WHAT A DISAPOINTMENT ! ! ! ! Compared to the old version this one is HORRIBLE . It is n't fun . The new rules [ are not good ] . You can not bet anymore . Money is n't the way it used to be ( what 's with the litte pieces of carton ? ) Maybe if someone at MB reads this they will go back to the basics and bring back what was once a great and fun family game to play . Lucky for us we still have , and play with , our old and much better version of Life .	-1
I remember having fun with the old version as a kid , and it was a much longer game . The new version is so BORING . You get a career , a house , lose money , get paid , and the game is over . There is almost no educational value . Monopoly has 20 times more interest , strategy and educational value than this dud . Please avoid the shock and do not play this game . DEFINITELY DO NOT PURCHASE ! ! !	-1
After growing up playing Life , I was really excited to pick this up at a yard sale . Lo and behold , they have updated it , and not at all in a good way . Maybe it 's more true to `` life '' -- -such as starting out on your way with a bank loan for school -- -but it was all downhill from there . Instead of landing on a career , you select one from a set of cards . Depending on where you land , you have to give other players money ( for instance , your doctor bills go straight to the doctor ) . Plus , we never seemed to really be having a hardship . There was always plenty of money ( thanks to `` Life '' cards that give you , say , $ 250,000 for winning a Pulitzer ) -- -so much so , in fact , that at the end of the game we were really quite overwhelmed with the task of adding it up . My husband also recalled that there was a benefit to having a car full of kids in the old game -- -no such luck here.It was such a bummer that I actually called my parents -- -in their 80s -- -to see if they still had my old version under a bed . Fortunately , they do , so we 'll finally be able to say , `` Hey ! THAT 'S Life ! `` Buyer beware .	-1
i bought the game the other day hoping that my family would enjoy it as much as i enjoyed the old version when i was a kid . this version is horrid . i hate it and wish i could return it . the spinner will not stay in and comes out all the time . the orange squares that force you to stop and re-spin seem like they go against the point of spinning . very very very disappointing . now i have wasted $ 20 and ca n't do anything with the stupid game .	-1
The game is ok , but I was disappointed as this now standard version is a changed , lower budget design of the original game . In general it is cheaply made . A couple pain points is the spinner does not stay in place unless you are very gentle with it , the people always fall out of the cars , and trying to get it all back in the box really does not work.And again , besides the poor quality , the game has been changed I assume to be more politically correct and is not as fun . Try and get the original and skip this version if at all possible.I did see what looked like a much nicer version in a considerably larger box at a major book store retailer ( has two names that start with `` B '' and `` N '' ) . It was at least 2x the price I paid , but I again bet a much nicer , higher quality edition worth the money .	-1
There are many early board games that are so much better than this one . ( Hi Ho Cherry-O is one of my favorites . ) The object is to roll a die to collect the cootie parts to put one together . You have to get the body first , which means you spend the first several turns waiting for a certain number . Many preschoolers will be bored before they even get started . Also , the legs go in at an awkward angle and my four-year-old is frequently frustrated when he ca n't do it himself and when they fall out again . I 'd have given it one star , but the bugs are cute . You might have some fun playing with them if you do n't actually try to play the game .	-1
In looking for fun games to play with our daughter , Cootie was one of those that we snatched up . Remembering playing it as a kid brings back nostalgic memories and so you just assume that it 's going to live up to those memories . Sadly , Cootie does not . First off , the game can drag on and become ridiculously monotonous once you 've attained all body parts except for those six legs . Rolling sixes can become rare and kids especially can become impatient and bored . Then you have the pesky problem of poor craftsmanship which leads to body parts being difficult to attach ( the legs in particular have a hard time going in their intended slots all the way ) or that have a hard time staying attached ( the heads fall off with the slightest movement ) . My daughter had more fun playing with the individual Cooties than actually playing the game , and she would have had more fun had their heads stayed on while she played with them . Alas , she played this yesterday and she 's already over it.So am I .	-1
Okay , it 's Cootie . Most of us know the game . Fun , right ? Well , it should be , but it isn't.One of our kids received this as a gift about 2 years ago . We did try to play it several times , but it was nothing but frustrating . The little parts were so poorly made that the legs and such did not stay in tightly and kept falling out . This was unbelievably disappointing for the kids . It was really just about unplayable . I had to get rid of it.Maybe we were just unlucky or maybe they 're making this cheaply these days . I do n't know . All I can say is I would n't waste your money finding out . There are plenty of better games out there.Junk !	-1
I and my 4 year old son have n't found this game to be that much fun , but I 've found it to be of poor quality as parts fit loosely or too tight ( heads may easily fall off the body ) and male attachment parts too easily break off and get left in the holes.Also , `` MADE IN MEXICO WITH DIE MADE IN CHINA '' .	-1
I bought this as a fun game for me and my son to play . Boy was I wrong ! ! It 's nothing but frustration for us both ! ! ! The pieces DO NOT stick in the bugs and fall off easily . The legs are also horrible to put on ! ! ! The rules of the game are ok but the pieces are absolutely horribly made . I would not buy this again.Also , this is n't the first one we got that did this . My mom brought one home from her work ( she 's a teacher ) and it did n't work either . So it is n't just our version .	-1
Not as well made as the Cootie games of old . The game is very frustrating because the pieces are hard to attach and then do n't stay attached . It was a great game in its day , but with this version the logistics get in the way of fun , making it a game none of us enjoy . Sad .	-1
This game is made very poorly . The pieces all have sharp plastic edges . The cardboard 'parts list ' piece falls apart and rips upon first using it . I would absolutely NOT recommend this game to others . I do n't know if the older version is made better or not . But , if it is , you should get online and find the classic version .	-1
If you like tons of tiny pieces to clean up ... And tons of choking hazards this is the game for you.Pros : Idea is neat , balancing beans until the bowl tips over.Cons : Around 60 tiny plastic beans to clean up.Surface of the bowl has very little traction so beans slide and tip off very quickly.The game is too hard for children under 8 , and not interesting for children over 8.Suggestion : Buy `` Do n't Break the Ice '' instead ... Kids love it and it is made by the same company and runs the same price .	-1
Milton Bradly makes some of our favorite family games , but this is not one of them . It 's cheap plastic , with poor fit and finish . We ca n't get our bean pot to balance evenly , so it starts to tip even before we put the beans on .	-1
I do not recommend this game and can not understand the 4.5 star average rating . Yes , my kids enjoy it . However , it is so poorly put together that its just really , really annoying to play . The plastic pieces routinely fall over , or come off entirely . The person pictures come out quite easily unless you tape them in place , and if you tape them they may not flip properly . It takes maybe 30-60 seconds of `` set up '' time to play a 2-4 minute game . While this isnt the end of the world , I personally find it quite annoying.Here is how the game works : there are around 30 or 40 faces in the game . Each player randomly picks one card from the 40 . Each player has a rack which includes cards for all the faces which are turned away from the opposing player so that only you can see the faces in your rack . Each trait ( for example gender ) is split so that there is a minority ( i.e . there are only 6ish female faces , and 6ish black faces , etc ... ) and a majority ( the remaining faces -- i.e . 20+ are male , 20+ are white , etc ... ) . There are around 10 or so traits , all with this majority/minority trend -- gender , race , glasses , hats , bald , facial hair , etc ... Every person seems to have at least one or more minority traits ( i.e . its a man , but he is bald , or wearing a hat . ) You ask a question , ie `` is it a girl '' and , depending on the answer , flip over the boys/girls on your rack to eliminate them , and by process of elimination , and by asking more questions eg `` is the person bald '' work down till there is only one person on your rack , which must be the person the opposing player picked . Whoever gets down to one left on their rack first ( i.e . figures out who the other player picked first ) wins . Getting lucky and picking the right minority trait to ask about is more useful than good logic.I 'm not overly PC or anything , but I just cant warm to a game the whole purpose of which is asking questions designed to exclude people with minority traits , so you can , by process of elimination , figure out who is left.Moreover , the concept is so simple that I dont think the game is very educational . The kids ( even the very young ) quickly learn the basic concept . Once they learn it , there isnt any real learning left to do . ( Yes , its true an adult can use more advanced logic to pick the `` best '' questions , but good luck explaining that to a young kid . Indeed , I bet there are plenty of adults that would not understand the logic behind selecting an optimal question . ) Skip it .	-1
This would be a great game if it were n't made out of flimsy plastic . It is a pain in the neck to assemble and it constantly falls apart . The little flip-up doors do n't stay hinged properly and if you do n't get the little pictures inserted just-so , they fall out also . We 've played it 3 times and I 'm ready to throw it away . Shame on Milton Bradley for selling such a poor quality game .	-1
This is a great game . I remember playing it as a kid with another child who spoke French . Lots of fun , easy to play , not determined by chance , teaches children how to group into categories and narrow down choices - wonderful.Unfortunately , the new edition is very shoddily designed . The cards are flimsy , and they fall right out of their holders when they 're flipped ( or sometimes when they 're *not* flipped ) .Ultimately , the game is almost totally unplayable ! This is very disappointing to all of us . I 'm going to go see if I can find a vintage copy of this game , and I 'll be contacting the manufacturer about this as well ... though if I have an experience similar to that of a previous poster , I 'll probably get brushed off .	-1
When I saw other people playing with it , I thought it was going to be tons of fun . but then when I bought it it stunk . I played it for one or two days with my brother but afterwords it 's gathering dust in my closet along with Connect Four , Battleship and stuff like that . Do n't get hypnotized by this toy ! ! ! DO N'T BUY IT ! ! !	-1
My two boys did n't find this board game very interesting at all . The game itself is cheaply made . I find the cherries all over the house as they are so small and easy to misplace . My kids prefer chutes and ladders 10x over this one .	-1
The game is poor for young kids and pieces is too small which easily become a harzard things for kids . I am not worry because my son never put stuffs into his mouth but other kids may .	-1
the fruits in this game is way too small for a kid to play with . its sometimes frustrating . i say , there are so many other games available . leave this one out .	-1
I remember this game being much more fun when I was little . but my son is n't that interested in it and neither am I. I would highly recommend the sneaky snacky squirrel game over this .	-1
I love Yahtzee , and for years , I had just used random 6 siders taking from other games , and printed the scorecards off the internet , but I was out shopping and saw this `` classic '' edition in the clearance bin for $ 7 , and thought , `` The dice look cool and maybe its time to get a `` real '' version . So I bought it and took it home and we played it , and now I see why it was in the clearance bin . The black holder for the dice , that is supposed to act as a rolling cup is rubbish . It does n't stand up , so someone has to be constantly holding it upright or all the dice spill out . The dice themselves are cheap , lightweight dice that feel like you could crumble them in your bare hands , and I fully expect them to break at some point . It does come with a full sheet Yahtzee score cards ( yippee ) , and NO rolling tray . Even my moms `` cheap '' Yahtzee game from the 90 's included a really cheap rolling tray . Hasbro has redefined CHEAP for games , a bit too cheap for my taste . Someday I will just buy one of the Deluxe editions and be done with it .	-1
Sorry ... . but to & # 34 ; Old School & # 34 ; eyes , it is hard to use the new and improved ( not ) score cards . Every other column is shaded , but my 50+ eyesight makes the shading hard to see . Please bring back plain , black and white . But it really does n't matter since my last order will last for 10 years . : )	-1
I 'm disappointed that they apparently eliminated the categories & # 34 ; Pair & # 34 ; and & # 34 ; Two Pair & # 34 ; , which I felt made the game more fun . Without those , I just do n't feel like playing .	-1
So , you want to buy Scrabble , huh ? You were playing at your Grandmas , and you saw she had this cool version with a rotating turntable , wooden tile holders , nice deep pockets where the letters sit on the board . You decided to buy one yourself here at amazon . You ordered it , excited to have a high quality Scrabble in your own possession . You get it in the mail , you open the box , thrilled to own Scrabble , but then ... . the unthinkable ! ! This ai n't your Grandma 's Scrabble ! ! What they have done , is turn a nice idea into the cheapest thing they could come up with and still call it `` deluxe Scrabble '' . PLASTIC . Everything is PLASTIC . The tiles might be wood , I dunno I did n't bite them , but everything else is cheap , thin plastic . Does n't turn nice like the old version . And the biggest kicker of them all , is the board itself . Gone are the nice deep squares the tiles would sit in - where even if you bumped into the game or table , they would stay put . Now it 's shallow grooves , and you have to be careful not to turn the board to quicky or they 'll move easy.You 're better off buying an old one at a garage sale .	-1
I could not believe this `` deluxe '' version was so poorly made . I have a previous deluxe edition and this one does n't even come close . The tile holders on the board are so shallow and made of flimsy plastic . The tiles constantly come out and mess up the board . The board itself is smaller , the turnstile is n't attached and the overall plastic on the board is cheaply made . I am so disappointed they charge $ 35 for this product and it is going back . I am getting the Onyx Edition from Barnes and Noble instead .	-1
Cheap imitation of the original . I would not recommend this . They are marketed as the original Barrel of Monkeys but these are not them .	-1
Kind of disappointed in this item . We did n't receive red , yellow or blue as described . We received purple which is annoying but does n't affect the product . And there are only 10 monkeys . Lots of other reviewers said 12 . The barrel is not even 1/3 filled . The monkeys themselves are cute and a good size .	-1
Aggravation is one of those eternal classics , and is also known as Wahoo ( Parchisi is another variant of the same basic concept ) . Unfortunately , this edition is not . The board is cheaply made and rather hideous to look at ( I guess that 's all at the expense of `` being cool '' ) . This board has been out since the 1990s , and it 's rather sad this is the only model currently available on the market that I know of . The game goes much faster because of how wonky the marble path is around each home colour ( purple , red , etc ) . The board itself is cheaply made and starts comes apart pretty easily . Also , this board is aimed squarely at little kids , and Wahoo is one of those games that adults can play with equal pleasure.I have an Aggravation board from the 1980s , and that board looks so much more stylish . I wish they had that.If you are wanting a good board , do n't get this one . There are plenty of home made wooden boards available on Ebay and other sources . In the past few years I have bought two different wooden boards off Ebay that were dual sided . One side had a four player version and the other side had a six player version for my wife 's grandma who loves Wahoo . I bought a second one from the same vendor a year or two later with an 8 player game on one side and a 4 player game on the second side . The quality of these boards are great , strong , and durable.Trust me , if you like Wahoo/Aggravation , a wooden board is definitely the way to go ! Much classier and much more appealing to adults as well as kids !	-1
The product they are advertising , the older game with the 5x5 grid , is not what was shipped . We received the 3x3 grid . Now , I have to go through the hassle of returning this game . Based on other people 's reviews , this is not the first time this has happened and this is false advertising . Essentially , you are selling the kiddie version at a 200 % mark up with the hope that some people wo n't return the product . You need to be reported or pull this product .	-1
I 'm giving this only 1 star more because of the seller than the game . It was shown in the photo as the 25 piece Milton Bradley game and the description read & # 34 ; Fit all 25 pieces ... & # 34 ; . It was listed as Prime eligible and I selected 2 day shipping . It took more than a week to arrive and Instead of the Milton Bradley version , I was sent the Hasbro 9 piece game . I bought the game on Amazon but they were not the seller . I have to give props to Amazon , though . I sent the game back the same day it arrived and by the next day Amazon had refunded my money .	-1
So I have ordered this item twice now and both times the item that shows up to the door is the cheap $ 9.99 one which has only 9 piecesHasbro A4754 Perfection GameIt shows up just under the description up top as a new model . Its sold by and fulfilled by Amazon . I love Amazon and have used them for over 4 years so its a little frustrating to have to explain everything to customer service , print RMA , and run up to the post office twice . So just make sure you have receive the correct item . Oh and make sure to order now using smile.amazon.com and have Amazon donate .5 % to your favorite charity . lots of Love Amazon , MikePS Rating is not for product but for wrong delivery twicePPS Sorry Amazon customer support for my venting to you over the phone I know it was not your fault the delivery got screwed up , I was having a bad day	-1
Be very careful when ordering . The photo and description clearly stated this was a 25-piece set . NOT . When it arrived , it was a 9-piece game . l	-1
I bought this one thinking it was the old version due to the picture but it is actually Hasbro 's new connect four version which is definitely not as durable . Annoyed that I was misled but still love the game .	-1
Nice idea . I enjoyed this game when I was little but they sure do n't make them like they used to . I , a 28 year old , found this frustrating to use forget my 3 year old . We played ( and by `` played '' I mean tried to play ) it twice before I threw it out . More junk for the landfills .	-1
This game is not as well made as we older people remember it . One of the heads on the hippos will not even lift up when the lever is pushed and one of them will not retract after the lever is pushed . My daughter likes it if we are the only ones playing because two of them do work . But it does not work like I remember it .	-1
I thought my son would have fun with this game and he did manage to despite it 's overwhelming flaws . The game is horribly cheap and it does n't fit into the box once assembled so in order to put the game away you either have to take all the hippos off ( and they really are n't made well enough for that kind of repeated on and off ) or buy something else to store it in . How hard is it to make a box that the finished game fits in ? Very flimsy did n't last long before breaking . A huge disappointment .	-1
This game has really gone downhill from what it used to be . It is now very cheaply made , the board is n't even one piece , and the marbles are n't even real ... they are plastic ! Sometimes the hippos come off the board while we are playing . It 's a very cheaply made game that was a waste of money . It does n't even fit into the box correctly . We were very disappointed and we are on the look out at garage sales for the original game .	-1
We have the same complaints as others ... this game is sooooo cheaply made , especially for the price ! ! The marbles are light plastic and seamed -- they do n't roll as well as they could . The hippos detach sometimes during play , one seems to not want to ever be attached . The levers get stuck sometimes , sometimes the balls get stuck in their throats . It is all very Flimsy . Trying to store it again is a joke.That said , my kids still like it . It is unbelievably NOISY , and I think that 's what they like , plus it 's very fast paced . I would never play it with a very competitive child , they would drive you nuts complaining about how their hippo was n't working right or whatever . The best part is flipping the balls into play with the springy thing , they pop really high.We play on a carpeted floor , so the board does n't move as much and stray balls do n't get away too badly .	-1
I bought this game for my five-year-old for Christmas because I enjoyed it as a child and because they were out of Moon Sand ! The game comes in pieces -- the square base , the four hippo bodies and four hippo heads . When you put it together , it does n't fit in the box . The instructions suggest taking the hippos off for storage . They have a picture of how to arrange it , but it does n't fit in the box that way . You can tell on the picture the pieces are hanging over the edge . So you have to take at least one hippo head off to make it all fit . Putting it together is n't too much trouble but the pieces are evetually going to wear out and not snap together . I do n't expect this toy to make it until next Christmas unless we find a place to store it out of the box.The game is really fun , parents will even enjoy playing it with the kids . Just do n't expect it last forever .	-1
I loved this game as a child and wanted to buy it for my 3 year old son . Great game , now made into a piece of PLASTIC GARBAGE ! . The light weight marbles are terrible and the heads of my hippos do n't even lift up most of the time.It 's truly a shame they have to ruin these type of games with cheap materials .	-1
I remember enjoying this game as a kid , but it must have been a much higher-quality product than this cheap rendition . From a kids ' perspective , it 's frustrating because the heads often get `` stuck '' in the extended position and wo n't spring back ; from a parent 's perspective , it 's a pain to assemble , and nearly impossible to disassemble ( and you MUST disassemble it if you want to fit it back into the small box . Why they ca n't sell this in a larger box I do n't know , but I guess they 're saving money on packaging ) . If you DO N'T manage to get it back into the box ( which I only did once ) , it must be stored as is , with no receptacle to contain the marbles , and a shape too awkward and bulky to fit easily on a shelf . I finally sneaked this thing away into my give-away pile , after only 6 months of use , and I hope the kids forget all about it .	-1
As a parent and having played this game when I was a child and enjoying it very much then , I have to say that the way that Milton Bradley has modified their old fashioned games is pretty bad . I remember the game when I was a child , the marbles were larger and the hippos as well , however playing the game was much more easier . In this one we found a lot of incoveniences.Examples : The marbles are very small and light , not suitable for children under 4 , they often jump OFF the game board to the floor and if you have wood or tiled floor you 'd have to run to get them . The hippos would often detach from the main board while in game play , knowing children who are sometimes hyperactive this is a NO-NO . My children who are only 5 & 6 ( they were 4 & 5 last christmas ) would be so excited playing the game when some of the mentioned things happened and could not keep up with marbles all over the floor . In other words if a parent is not present the marbles will get lost under the surrounding furniture . I just got tired of running after them.I also bought Operation also by Milton Bradley , do n't even get me started there . Quite a dissapointment as well . With these modifications the fun of the games is gone . The marbles from Hungry Hippos are nowhere to be found and the game is sitting there doing nothing , next step is the trash .	-1
I feel robbed . The hippos never stay on the base plate , unless you use your other hand to hold them down . Out of 4 hippos , 2 work great , and the other 2 's levers stick nearly every time you try to grab a marble . It frustrates us to the max ! ! !	-1
Four year old loves this game and frankly so do I. Hippos are poorly constructed and sometimes you have to do a timeout so you can fix them.If only they made it like they did 25 years ago . Such a delightful game ... if only ... And helloooo ... .you have to pull the whole toy apart and deconstruct the already flimsy turtles so you can fit it back in the box.As long as I can stand it on the living room floor is how long we 'll play with it . Too much hassle to pull it apart .	-1
tiny and impossible to play because you cant control the balls ... wtf . .. the idea was cool . . .	-1
I got this thinking it would a great little toy for my toddler , but i could n't even get the hippos to 'eat ' the balls . The mechanism keeps getting jammed , the balls keep getting stuck in between the hippo and the plastic dome ... i got frustrated with it so i could only imagine the melt down with my child . It does say 4 and up , but i am well over 4 and i couldnt get the toy to work . waste of money , get the real one .	-1
Returned it . No longer the one pictured in the photo ( the pink and yellow pair ) . Now much flimsier and does n't work well .	-1
The play-doh itself ? Of course that is great . The size however . I thought I was getting full size containers . These are small . Not the tiny Halloween sized one but small . For the price I could have got more at target .	-1
If you want to spend the money on something you can use a few times , then it is ok.After opening each box , you have about two days before it dries out and gets hard.I always keep the lid on but still dried.I opened one color at a time ( one in a week or so ) but decided to make my own : )	-1
it is my own fault for not reading the description closer , but these are the little tiny cans . I paid around $ 8 , and it was a total rip off compared to buying the big containers at Walmart . I 'll be more careful next time .	-1
I should have looked more closely at the description . These are very small cans , and I was looking for full size .	-1
This little thing is made out of plastic . A very cheap one , the wheels are toy-like , they make a lot of noise , the steering-wheel keeps falling off and I need to stop and push that piece of plastic inside the cover/compartiment . I lost the ring that holds the handle in place -- after 2 days . The seat vibrates making my son want to stand up . I guess his little rear hurts . My son is 11 mo , yet , his legs are not comfy inside , they sometimes fall on the sides . Too crowded . I wish they will rethink the whole product . I would recommend rubber wheels and doors and a more comfy bench/sitting area .	-1
would have loved the item except that amazon shipped the item missing the handle , the seat belt , and the decals - therefore , we ended up having to ship the item back to amazon at a cost of almost as much as the item was worth ! So far we have not received a credit for the item OR the shipping so we are REALLY dissatisfied customers !	-1
The diameter is as large as the original slinky , but not the length . It does not have enough mass to store enough energy to make a trip down a flight of stairs . Unless you want to spend time shuffling this thing from one hand to another , and frustrating children with its inability to do much of anything , not a good pick .	-1
Not good on 11 & # 34 ; depth stairs . We stretched out the center of the slinky so it was usable on 11 inch treads . Still did n't work very well but was okay . Worked best on older New England house with narrow staircase .	-1
Recalling how I was mesmerized by my Slinky `` walking '' down our stairs as a child in the 1960 's , I was really looking forward to introducing my 5 year old grandson to this classic toy . ( I purchased a `` Slinky Jr. '' at the retail level , which was a complete waste of money ... I promised my grandson I 'd purchase a `` REAL '' Slinky , like Grandma had when she was his age . ) Finding the price seemed reasonable on Amazon , I purchased one , just received it this week , and went to give it an initial nostalgic `` workout '' prior to sharing what I remembered as a wonderful toy with him . Well , it does NOT walk down stairs , and only does the initial `` flip '' when on the floor ! Maybe it was only $ 5 , but I do n't believe in throwing money out of the window ! What a shame that they - somehow - changed this product so that it no longer performs like the REAL `` original '' ! So disappointed was I in this purchase that I wanted to try to figure out what `` happened '' to that great old Slinky . Even though , as the box claims , it WAS invented in 1946 , the inventor died in 1974 , and his wife sold it to `` Poof Products '' , the current manufacturer , in 1998 . I do n't think the inventor would be too pleased with how they 've changed his product over the past few years ! I did n't bother reading reviews prior to purchasing , because of the `` original '' label , but now that I 've read over the first few pages of these reviews , I noticed something -- - the 4 & 5 star ratings for the product are dated 2008 & prior ( except for one reviewer who used them to keep out squirrels instead of as a toy ) ... the reviews from 2011 , 2012 & 2013 are all rated only 1 or 2 stars , so they DID change something , and this is NOT the `` original '' Slinky ! What a shame that the company this was product was sold to ( Poof ) tinkered with a classic .	-1
This slinky is small/ too short . It does not & # 34 ; walk down stairs & # 34 ; . Total waste of money . I do not recommend buying it .	-1
I thought the & # 34 ; original & # 34 ; Slinky would be large enough to go down stairs as mine did as a child . WRONG ! If you actually want one that does stairs you need the now & # 34 ; GIANT & # 34 ; Slinky .	-1
This is not the & # 34 ; original & # 34 ; slinky . It is much smaller and will not walk down stairs . To me that was always the fun part or even the point of a slinky . This one is pretty much useless and no fun for my daughter . Would not recommend unless you are setting it on a shelf in a box for nostalgic purposes .	-1
My son had a plastic slinky before this one . It did n't last very long . I got the metal one thinking that it would . I was mistaken . In a matter of weeks he had managed to get this so tangled up that we had to bin it . It was impossible to get it untangled . The toy has no apparent educational value and the novelty of watching it 'walk ' wears off after a few times . I would not purchase another slinky no matter how he bargains !	-1
I do not think this is as big as the original slinky we had as kids . It does not go down the stairs . Perhaps there is a bigger one ?	-1
This broke the first time we took it out for our child to play with . Was very disappointed . Would go with a plastic one over a metal one if you want kids to play with .	-1
This was not a wise choice in particular for my son . He barely touches it and not intrigued by this toy at all . the cord is also very short to be pulling aroound	-1
The phone cord and pull string are way too short . I understand cords have been shortened for safety reasons , but the cords are so short , it negates the usefulness of the product . I 'm not even remotely impressed with the Chatter Phone .	-1
I know the cord is short to avoid choking or other damage to the little one , but in this case it really makes the toy unusable to & # 34 ; talk & # 34 ; on the phone you have to have the actually base dangling in mid air , quite awkward .	-1
I purchased this phone as a gift for my now 1 year old . She loved an old pull toy and grandma 's house and I thought this would be a lot of fun for her . While it looks like the old school version , it is nothing like it at all . The components are a very cheap plastic . The wheels are cheap so it does not pull well . Both strings are way to short to make this playable as a phone or as a pull toy . I would buy something different as a pull toy if that is what you are looking for . As for a phone , the string is only a couple inches long so she ca n't hold it up to her ear without bringing the whole toy with it- what a waste .	-1
Does not function as a play phone . The cord is too short so you ca n't pretend talk without having the whole phone hanging from your face ! I get it , long cord=choking hazard , but ... the string for pulling is REALLY long . Is n't that a hazard ? You can pull it around though .	-1
My 1-1/2 y/o just has n't seemed the least bit interested in playing with this toy from the first day she received it until now . I guess with all the push button phones and cell phones nowadays , she ca n't relate to the old rotary phones . ( ? ? )	-1
it looks cute and when one pulls it its eyes close and open . But the cord of the phone is too small . if the phone is placed on the table the receiver will not reach the child 's ear until he holds the phone in his hands . It does n't make any ringing sound or any hello or bye sound when u lift the receiver . Over all am not happy . But my son liked it however doest use it much	-1
look for something better . this is pure junk , made in china so plastics are not safe and the cord is too short and thin enough to be unsafe anyway , also arrived with the paint already peeled off in some places !	-1
I bought this for my 10 month old . He walks very well on his own already . He was excited when he heard the popping noise as I pushed it around and showed him how it works but for some reason he ca n't maneuver this toy by himself very well . Even at 11 months he 's not able to do it although he walks perfectly on his own . I think it 's because the handle is so narrow and the toy is light weight . Also on hardwood floors the wheels do n't grip so it does n't pop but rather just drags across the floor . I would take this back to the store if i could .	-1
I am not sure if I got a defective one or not , but the wheels would not turn without a lot of force . I ended up returning this to Amazon .	-1
This product is just so-so . Makes popping sound but that 's about . Wo n't hold interest for long.Better spend a bit more for one of those poppers with funny heads going up and down when rolled over.A more interesting sight .	-1
My 1-1/2 y/o toddler has not seemed to be the least bit interested in this toy since the day she first received it .	-1
My son loves to push objects , anything and everything which is why i always wanted to buy him a push toy . This is nice except that it makes too much noise and sometimes my son gets scared of it . The noise also is a little disturbing to the ears . If your baby loves a push toy too , get something that is not noisy .	-1
Based on the fantastic reviews of this product I thought it was going to be a great hit . Wrong ... the twins are terrified of this toy . They would literally startle/jump when they hear the popping noise . They have so far refused to have anything to do with it . They are n't typically timid or noise sensitive in most situations . The popping sound is very loud and sudden , so I can see how it can be anxiety provoking for a 1 year old unless it is used in a place with high background noise . Luckily it is a cheap item so I will hold on to it in hopes that it will make a good gift for another child some day . I will probably try to reintroduce this toy again in a few months , but seriously ... The only thing they are more frightened of is the vacuum cleaner .	-1
My son is now 5 months old and has never shown any interest in this toy . Maybe part of the reason why is that it was hard for him to kick it hard enough or in the right spots to make it play enough ? Either way , I took it out of his crib since he was n't getting any use out of it . Maybe he 'll like it to use on the floor when he 's sitting up ? We 'll see .	-1
The dye from the blue ring comes off , and my baby had it all over her face ! I do n't care if the company says it 's non-toxic , I do n't want my child ingesting this dye , and you should n't either ! Why is this still on the market ?	-1
We got this for our son when he was 6 mo old . He 's now 11 mo old and still is n't very interested in playing with it ... .maybe he will eventually . Right now he will take the rings off , throw them , then moves on to something else . It 's not very entertaining for him ( yet ? ) . I really liked the price though ! ! We 'll see what happens .	-1
This classic toy is overpriced here . You can get it at any dept . store.Also this toy is not the best . I have more trouble locating all the rings , that the baby throws them around everywhere . Not the greatest toy .	-1
My son has had this toy since he was 6 months old . He 's 11 months old now . He plays with all kinds of toys and enjoys them , but has never cared anything about this toy , past using the rings as chew toys . It 's a pretty boring toy .	-1
My daughters had no interest in this toy . A couple of times I saw my youngest use the rings for bracelets otherwise it did n't get played with . It was a waste of money and I would not buy this again for another child .	-1
This ride on toy was given as a gift for my son 's first birthday . My son would rather push this toy around than to sit on it and take it for a ride . He 'd enjoy it if I were pushing him around but I 'd have to teach him to keep his feet up or it 'll hit the wheels . After minutes of pushing and my backaches , the fun is done and he just wanders off and looks for something else to play with . Also , this toy is very lightweight so when he tries to get on or off this bike without assistance , it 'll tip or slide , making him lose his balance and fall . There are other toys out there that would be more exciting and less painful .	-1
I do daycare in my home and have for over 27 years and raised many children of my own ... ..they always loved Colorforms but I was disappointed with the game 's `` stickiness '' and the children tired of it much more quickly than I had expected . Would not recommend it for kids that are used to lots of video/electronic games ... .they would be bored .	-1
not like i remembered as a kid , these did n't even stick very well . we sure did n't use this for long .	-1
My mom bought this for Easter for my daughter who was 6 months at the time . I did n't expect her to be able to hit the balls , but when my nieces who are 7 & 9 years old tried to hit the balls through the holes- it took a lot of strength . I do n't understand why they would make a baby toy so hard for a baby to use . It 's a great concept I would suggest another toy like this from another company .	-1
I got this because my 4-year-old loves gears . My kids have the Playschool Busy Gears and love them . I thought this would be a more advanced version of that for her to play with . I do n't like this toy though because it is really difficult to put together . My daughter likes to turn the gears with the handle , but an adult always has to build it for her . Other kids I have seen play with this toy have a lot of trouble too . It looks cool but is n't a practical choice for a kid . The base is really hard to put together because not all of the pieces will interlock with each other . The pegs that hold the gears onto the base are also very hard to put on .	-1
This would have a good toy if it were n't for the dizzying amount of color . The actual board is so loaded with primary colors that it is hard to imagine a young mind getting a perspective on where to put the colorforms . A broader , cleaner white background would have improved this item a great deal . In this case , less would have been more .	-1
I bought this for my 18-month-old , but I wo n't bother trying to write whether or not she had fun with it or if it was age-appropriate ... because the toy simply did n't work . And I think this is my first negative review on Amazon ! The `` clings '' did n't cling at all . At . All . In fact , within 6 weeks they had curled up and yellowed a bit . Now , I live on the east coast , not arid Arizona , so I do n't know what the problem is , but it seems like cheap manufacturing . At any rate , early on we tried licking the clings to get them to stick to the scene , and that sort of worked , but soon they were too curled and non-sticky for even that to be a possibility . What a waste of money , and so frustrating for my eager toddler . For a MUCH better , similar toy , buy the Melissa & Doug reusable sticker padMelissa & Doug Reusable Sticker Pad Bundle ( Pack of 2 ) ... it 's actually reusable and comes with multiple scenes and a LOT of cling stickers .	-1
Do n't waist your money . I bought 2 you can hardly see the lines and the nobs do n't work very well . In the trash	-1
I read the reviews , but still ordered the thing . My bad . The etching is so thin and faint , you ca n't see it very well . If you buy this toy , try it out first . I wished I had . Instead , I gave it to my Grandson and let him play with it . Now , I do n't have the heart to take it back from him so I can return it . What a shame they had to change it . I remember spending hours with mine when I was a kid .	-1
I bought this toy for my son 's 4th birthday . His birthday is tomorrow and I just opened the package to wrap it and I 'm wishing I had opened it last week ! Already I 'm disappointed ! The screen is much smaller than the version from my childhood . I could live with that . But , the part I 'm not liking at all is that the lines do n't completely erase . I wrote a large `` E '' on the screen and no matter how much I shake it the `` E '' is still visible . This toy may be going back . I 'm not happy thus far .	-1
Do n't know if I just got a lemon , but my etch a sketch was junk . Did not work well , lines would disappear while drawing then come back in another part of the screen . Some lines were not even straight . Very disappointed , my son had a key chain sized etch a sketch that worked much better .	-1
They sure do n't make these like the ones we had as kids . The writing is so faint you can hardly see it . I was excited to get it for my Grandson because it was my favorite toy as a kid . I was disappointed .	-1
the sketching resulted in such a dim/hazy drawing that it did n't hold my toddler 's attention at all , since she could n't see anything.also the clunky knobs do n't allow for much maneuvarability.yes there 's some nostalgic value to this , but she 's gone back to drawing on our ipad and is much more pleased with the visuals/colors.I returned this .	-1
I could n't wait to buy this for our two toddlers . Not long after I popped it open ( it is quite easy to set up , takes about 5 seconds ) and attached the two tunnels , my kids were happily crawling through it . Then ... ... .uh oh ! With normal movement , the tunnels detached easily , the kids found it cramping to sit and play together under the dome , and they became frustrated that they could n't freely crawl from one tunnel through the dome and out the other side of the second tunnel without getting their clothing and sneakers caught on the sides or on the velcro.My kids are petite , and still they were clumsy inside . They gave up on it after 20 minutes and we just packed it up for return . I read the age guidelines and figured they 'd be just fine , but aside from it folding easily and storing conveniently in a carry bag , this is not the oodles of fun that it 's advertised to be . I 'd recommend a play tent that does not feature attachable tunnels ... .they DETACH way too easily !	-1
I ordered this a while back to save for a rainy day . It 's always nice to have a brand new box of crayons and I remember thoroughly enjoying the giant box of Crayola crayons I once received as a child . I thought this box would have them arranged by color shade . I do n't remember reading the description past 120 UNIQUE colors . Well sure enough , as others have noted , there are 3 boxes of crayons here-2 boxes of 48 and one 24 . I came back to review my order curious how much I had paid for this disappointment . The boxes of 48 look identical on the outside . After reading the comments that they are not the same I looked inside both . They might have different colors but without taking them all apart and organizing them maybe not . I still find this whole thing misleading . I also remember seeing the box at Target after I bought it and thinking I did not get a great deal as it was 5.99 at Target . I paid about 7.00 here at the time . My girls are still happy to have new crayons and are cleaning up the craft table now to get started but I am disappointed at the misleading description . I am usually happy with Crayola products . Skip this one though !	-1
Crayola makes the best crayons , do n't get me wrong . This box of crayons is actually several smaller boxes of the exact same colors . I was expecting a large variety of colors instead of just a large amount of the same colors .	-1
My son is really into fishing and wanted a game like that so my mom brought it home for him . My mom is a preschool special education teacher and had this game at her work but did n't need it so gave it to my son . The suction cup piece is a little annoying and my son does n't really enjoy playing it because there are so many ways to play it . He has more fun just picking them up cause the suction cup is really weak . Could be better .	-1
I am so mad . I ordered this game back in August when I started ordering my Christmas gifts . Yesterday I started wrapping the gifts and thought it was strange that there was black sharpie markings on all sides of the box . I opened it up and all 4 boats had sharpie scribbles on them . Really . . . REALLY ! I am not rating the game ; I ca n't imagine an Amazon Vendor sending out something that would appear on the shelves of a Salvation Army store ! ! ! ! !	-1
I received this slinkly dog for my four year old daughter . Although she loooves Toy Story I found this dog to be extremely small . Just a little bigger than a barbie doll , in my opinion . I have not given it to her yet for Christmas and even though I know she will love it - -my impression is that it is too small .	-1
This toy is useless . The cord is so short you ca n't pull it behind you . It is placed in a weird spot on the dogs head . The plastic is very cheap too . If you want to collect all the toy story toys and leave them on the self this would be fine but if your giving it to kids do n't bother .	-1
My two-year old loves Elmo and I was so excited for him to have this toy . It worked for about 2 months . Now he 's got a really expensive stuffed Elmo that does n't do anything .	-1
Please kids toys should be free of toxic fumes . I had to return because my kid also tried to taste the toxic material..	-1
Seriously , this marble run is dollar store quality . Cheap , light weight plastic ... even the slighted nudge knocks the pieces out of place . Some of the pieces just sit on top of one another , rather than `` snap '' together like they should.And unlike the description and the picture on the front of the box , this set does not come with real glass marbles . You get 10 plastic balls that are about half the size of a real marble . They still work of course , but just the fact that they show real marbles being used adds insult to injury.Not to mention , 45 pieces is n't enough to get creative with . I 'd recommend spending slightly more money of a better quality version with more pieces .	-1
We were really excited to get this track for our son for christmas , he loves to play with marbles . I did some research , and went with this one . We are disapointed , the plastic is cheaply made , and easily breaks . It is too hard for him to put together himself ( he is 5 ) . My husband or I has to to it , even then it takes a lot of time and patience . The red spinning wheels it comes with area good idea , but they dont work ! The marble gets stuck everytime . Also , it only comes with one `` exit '' piece . Their must be a better quality track out there ! We found this track to be cheaply made , and very frusterating . I would pass on this one ...	-1
We purchased this marble run for our 4-year old son because of his great love for wooden marble run assembly blocks , which he has been using since he was 2 . While this set ia terrific idea and certainly has a lot of educational value , it is made of very flimsy plastic and is in no way durable . Taking it apart and putting it back together in different configurations ( which should be half the fun ) always proves fatal for at least one more piece of the set for us ; they crack and spliter off sharp chards every time . While I love this idea and love wooden marble sets , I regret purchasing this and certainly do n't recommend it as it is made of such flimsy plastic .	-1
I had a Fisher-Price version on these playmats which I gave 5 stars.http : //www.amazon.com/Fisher-Price-Songs-Smiles-Discovery-Gym/dp/B000OONJBO/ref=cm_cr-mr-titleIt was really great and colorful and came with a heap of hanging toys and a mirrored , music-playing dog.After lending it to a friend and getting it back bent out of shape my hubby bought this one as a last minute xmas gift for our Baby # 2 . It was the only one in the store he had ducked into . It only has 3 hanging toys . Every other similar playmat has heaps of toys and most have music and lights as well . My main dislike of this one is that the arches are quite low , lower than the Fisher-Price one , so it seems like the toys are right in Baby 's face . Other than those deficiencies , the mat is reasonably padded and the material is soft , not silky but soft enough . I would not recommend this to anyone but I do recommend the Fisher-Price one .	-1
I have had this toy for 3 1/2 years . My now 3 year old never really wanted to use it . A few mins . now and then was all she wanted . I found that it was always in the way . When I had my next little girl ( now 1 ) I figured it would be used this time . No such luck . The only time she had any fun with it was when her big sisters ran around finding other toys to attach to it . This toy takes up too much room and is too much money .	-1
Arrived with a botched paint job - sent back and did n't use . I 've liked all of the HABA items we have purchased other than this so it was disappointing .	-1
I was very excited to get these blocks for my son since they 're made of wood and non-toxic paint . However , when we got the blocks , I noticed that many tiny splinters coming off of them . They do n't seem sharp enough to be a problem for hands , but for a kid who still puts everything in his mouth , that could be really dangerous ! I chewed on one myself to see what would happen , and was able to easily dent/break some of the wood . I contacted the company and they had great customer service . They sent me a second set of blocks right away . Unfortunately , those blocks have the same problem.All in all , they are beautiful blocks and I plan to keep them for when my son is older . I think the wood they are made from is just too soft to be durable to tiny teeth . I bought a set of baby 's first blocks from Haba which are perfect for him right now .	-1
I was so excited to get this for my 4 year old daughters Innotab 2 but ended up very upset.This was a great product for about the first month then the other day it stopped working . I tried a new outlet but still nothing . I then replaced the batteries in the Innotab2 to make sure it was the game itself . The machine worked fine but the plug still didn't.Since I only paid a few dollars for it I am not too worried about returning it and have already purchased a new charger from a different brand.Over all , the idea of having a charger right from the same company as the Innotab is great but the product itself is a mess .	-1
Ordered 2 of these for my kids systems- first , I THOUGHT they were chargers , which they are not . They are just power sources . Guess thats my fault for not paying better attention . But secondly , they barely lasted a month before they just quit powering the systems altogether . Very disappointed . So we are stuck just using batteries which the systems eat for breakfast . Purchase these at your own risk . Maybe you 'll end up having better luck .	-1
It did n't work on my Grandson 's Vtech Smile Motion game . I have n't tried it on his other Vtech toys , but very disappointed it does n't work on the Vtech Motion game .	-1
I guess I should 've read the reviews on this before purchasing for Christmas . We had n't needed to use it for my daughter 's tablet until this past weekend on a road trip . Well that was $ 9 wasted . I 'm glad it was n't more expensive . We purchased this for Christmas last year so we 're past the point of returning it . I will go get her an AC adapter from Wal-Mart or the BX today . I 'm sure I 'll have no issues with that . Hopefully the car charger I bought with this does n't have the same issue . *sigh* I guess we 'll see today .	-1
I have purchased 2 adapters and both of them quit working after just a few weeks . The toy runs well off batteries , and they actually last a while . I would invest your money in batteries instead of this adapter .	-1
Globes are nice , but if you really want a toddler to learn the world , buy a flat map and maybe supplement with a globe . Flat maps are much easier to read .	-1
I bought this puzzle for my 2 year old for Christmas . There is nothing magnetic about either the fishing pole or the puzzle pieces . We even tried to pick up other things such as a paperclip etc with the pole and nothing works . I would not recommend this product at all .	-1
I must admit I did n't read the description like I should have . I thought the blocks were included but this is for the PLATE only . And it does not work with the smaller blocks .	-1
A quarter ( coin ) sitting next to it for a scale for reference to size would have helped . Nothing burns my *ss more than getting a simple gift and finding out it is even more simple than I anticipated . I wanted a clock for my 2 year old to tinker with . This clock is not durable and it is not for a toddler.I would think twice before buying this unless you are in a controlled environment and/or using it with a very slow-moving child . This clock is `` dinky '' and tiny . Nothing more.Have fun .	-1
I would pay one buck for something like this because it reminds me of a dollar store item . The clip on the back that helps stand the clock upright is flimsy , cheap and constantly falls out . I 'm going to have to glue it in with D6000 . As for function - you just move the minute hand around and the hour hand will move appropriately with it . Okay that 's fine but I can make a paper clock do the same thing and spend pennies . Overall not happy at all with this product . I thought it was larger and had more function ( the latter my own fault for not reading more carefully ) . I see other reviewers have said theirs have loosened or wo n't tell the correct time anymore so I have that to look forward to in the near future , I 'm sure . My advice - visit the dollar store , make your own or splurge for a better clock .	-1
My son has been wanting a Wooden Railway Thomas forever , so I finally ordered one . Do not buy the $ 10 one sold by NonStop Group . It came straight from China ( did n't think that was a big deal -- after all , they 're all made in China anyway , I figured , and it was the only Wooden Railway Thomas available on Amazon when I was looking ) . The product was a joke : It was dirty , dented , cracked , had faded paint , and came in cheap packaging . Some kind of fake or something ? Needless to say , this is going back . I am astounded that Amazon would even do business with a company that sells this garbage .	-1
Mom of 2 boys here . I 'd say we could have put a down payment on a nice little bungalow for them in exchange for what we have spent on Thomas products , but hey ... .we need to relive our childhood.The concept of Cranky is good . Design is bad2 cranks , 1 for up , 1 for rotationmagnet will lift train cars & hotwheels cars if you kids are into thatBoys like it . Good for fine motor . Amuses them for a few minutes.The problem is Cranky 's head falls of if it is knocked over . I have glued his head back on 3 times with super glue ( each time scrapping off the old glue to get the best hold ) Head still falls offMy 3 year old calls the toy `` headless cranky '' because I have said he ca n't play with him until his head dries , that he is headlessI am not sure why they designed it for his head to break off . It could be made differently without effecting use .	-1
We 've played with this tower at public train stations , in private homes , and then I looked at 15 ( ! ) of them at a local box store . This is a lousy accessory that breaks almost as soon as you buy it . Or in the case of the box store , only half of them worked in the store to begin with . There are n't a lot of water towers on the market , so you 'll probably buy it anyway , but be forwarned that it is the usual Thomas Made-in-China junk that will probably be recalled like all of the Thomas products because of toxic something . Also , the pricing above it exactly 200 % of the list price .	-1
This is not one of the large plates to build an entire lego set on . It is a small plate . Buy the grey plate if you want the large plate to build an entire castle or large lego play set .	-1
I love leap frog toys , my 3 y/o has many . I usually find them very educational . However , this toy did n't live upto my expectations . I wanted a toy to help him learn to write letters . My child learns very quickly with encouragement and correcting . At 3 he 's reading at a 2nd grade level and writting somewhat legible ( no thanks to this toy ) . This toys tells the name and phonic of each letter . The LF train , Little Leap and Leap pad do the same thing in the same way . I bought it for the writting lesson . It shows how to write them in 'computer style ' not real handwritting . The reason I was so disapointed in it was that they can write anything in the spot and the toy tells them it 's right . My son scribbled in the area and was told he did great . It was n't teaching him anything . Sitting down and writting with the child , making sand letters and letting him trace with his finger and plain old letting him expierment with a pen and paper worked better than this thing . I took it back shortly after buying it .	-1
They need to take the word `` Prism '' off this product . Maybe it 's a `` light crystal '' whatever that is , but it is certainly not a prism . I had a few small prisms as a kid , little ones about a quarter of the size of this thing , and they made rainbows in the light . This does n't make rainbows from any light source I 've tried . My other family members , looking at the item and the package , tried to tell me that it is n't meant to make rainbows , and is n't a prism so I should n't expect it to . They did n't read the product description here and buy the silly thing though . It ' mostly just a hunk of plastic , it has some vague kaleidoscopic properties with the little rainbow cards it comes with , but all in all it is mostly just a useless hunk of clear plastic . Cheap , but pointless .	-1
My 3 year old daughter wanted a `` rainbow '' for Christmas . I thought this would be a nice way to give her one - and teach a little science lesson at the same time . I liked that it was acrylic , which makes it much safer and more durable for a young child . Unfortunately , it barely works , which just makes it frustrating for a young child . If I shine a very bright light on it , in an otherwise dark room , and get the angle JUST right , I can see a tiny , dim rainbow . That 's it . I 'm keeping it b/c it was inexpensive and not really worth sending back , but it was a bit disappointing .	-1
Well , yes , it looks good on display sitting on your shelf . But as for creating a striking prism rainbow i remember creating in 5th grade ( decades ago ) with a real crystal prism - it simply does not deliver at all . A standard household flashlight with new batteries should be enough to do the job but it doesnt . You can barely see colors on the outside fringes of the beam and you will need to hunt for them by rotating the prism . : (	-1
I bought this as a way to demonstrate some beginning physics principles to my daughter . I was n't able to make gyroscope work . My husband was able to , but only after several attempts . The prism is very small and the gyroscope is poorly constructed . The instructions are difficult to follow . I should 've known this would be a bust considering the very low price .	-1
I was so excited to get this for my son and his many cars , but the large sticker on the front of the case had a huge crease down the middle and looked cheap . Returned it .	-1
This thing fell apart almost instantly . Cheap plastic with a giant sticker on it , they just do n't make things like they used to .	-1
The picture is misleading . This is just a case , no car at all . It is really not worth that money .	-1
I wish I would have listened to the other bad reviews . This thing should be sold at the dollar tree . Not worth the money . The sticker was all bubbled up when we received it and the plastic is warped .	-1
I first purchased this game when it came out , years ago and it came with a great deal more materials . It was at the time when the operating systems were Vista and XP . I am very disappointed that ( 1 ) there has been a downgrading of the number of materials that come with this game , and ( 2 ) they have not kept pace with technology and upgraded the compatibility with the new operating systems . It 's still only compatible with Vista ( I hated Vista ) and XP . Now we are seeing Windows 8 and this ca n't be used with that OS . What a disappointment ! I need to contact the seller and return the game . Also , there are far fewer materials that come with the game than originally came with it . The paucity of materials is very disappointing . I think that the OS should be listed as one of the product features and that there should also be a list of what the game comes with . If you still have Vista and XP on your computer , and are inventive , you 'll be able to use this game and it will be very entertaining and fun as well as educational . If you do not have Vista or XP OS , you 're out of luck . Really , they need to update the disc so it 's compatible with the newer technology and computers . It was a great game when I first bought it . Unfortunately , our school had a break in and this game was stolen , otherwise , I 'd still have the original game that I 'd purchased and made into `` Shop-opoly '' just for my special education students . I 'd wanted to duplicate it , so I purchased it again , assuming that with the change in technologies , the disc would have also been updated . I 'm very disappointed . The game must go back , and the manufacturers need to update their disc which is central to the production of Make-Your-Own-Opoly . Sorry , it 's a disappointment if you have the wrong operating systems -- the old ones -- really old if judged in computer technology time .	-1
I just received this game for Christmas , and it is basically headed for the Goodwill pile . Everyone in my family uses Macs , and this game is only compatible with Windows XP or Vista . There really should be something for Mac users in 2012 , or there should be some sort of disclaimer on the front of the box . I 'm hoping that people buying this game as a gift will see the negative reviews and think to check the system requirements so that they do n't waste their money .	-1
Cheap , this is cheap and not worth the money I paid for it ! It broke soon after we go it ! Do not buy !	-1
Our 4 year old had a very difficult time with getting this to work . His hardest stomps barely got the rockets off the launch pad , even when he was jumping off a bench onto the stomp pad . Our 10 year old had no problem getting great high launches off , so I know the product works okay , I just do n't think its operation is well designed with little kids in mind .	-1
This is not made in Europe or USA per search criteria ; it is made in Israel , USA and CHINA . Hmmmmmmm ... cadmium , lead , melamine ? ? Pick your poison , but either way , my kid will not be getting such a `` gift '' from CHINA ! !	-1
We purchased two of these swings to go on our outdoor play gym for our triplets . We got it when they were about 18 months old ( they are now 22 months old ) . Our biggest issue is getting them in and out with shoes on . Their feet are constantly catching when trying to get them out and the two boys , who are larger , are much more difficult to get out . Several times my biggest , who is only 28lbs , has scraped skin off of his shins and knees when trying to pull his legs out . I 'm going to replace these with the 2-in-1 safe and secure swings so that I can get them out more easily without them getting hurt . Such a disappointment .	-1
I would say this toy is fun for kids 3 and under ... beyond that they get bored before the game is over . It 's also hard for an adult to play with a child because it 's way too easy to feel the pieces and figure out what to pull from the bag . You have to throw the game or win every time . That 's no fun because I love to play games like Candyland with the kids because sometimes you win and sometimes you do n't !	-1
I think the liquid is a little too thick and dark , and therefore kind of hard to tilt it just right to read the response . I would n't buy this again .	-1
My son received this as a birthday gift . I never played it as a child , and am not familiar with the original . But there are a couple of major things wrong with this toy . My main gripe is that - once it 's installed - it will not fit back in the original box . That 's a recipe for losing the 5 beanbags it comes with , and makes clean-up difficult . I 'm tempted to just toss this thing across the garage , into the trashcan , but I 'll probably end up donating it to my child 's preschool to avoid putting another giant piece of plastic crap into the landfill .	-1
The x 's and o 's do n't turn over too well . It makes the game a lot longer than it should be . Do n't waste your money .	-1
I wish I had read the other reviews before purchasing this toy . This version of Toss Across is just not the same as the one I enjoyed as a kid . The game and beanbags are smaller and it 's geared more toward playing on a table rather than on the floor . The worst part for us is that once put together , it is too big to fit back in the box . It might be able to be taken apart and then put back in but that would be a huge hassle . This makes it more difficult to store neatly and guarantees some lost beanbags .	-1
This game is very difficult to set up to even play it . You have to put all the sticks in the holes and they slide out a lot and you have to start over . If you can get it set up , it is a fun game , but there is a big if there .	-1
Do n't buy this is fyou want to play with a child they will become irritated at how many times it falls apart while trying to set it up . I went on Ebay and bought the Original and it was in great shapestill	-1
Well I bought this game because I remember from my childhood but let me tell you it is NOT the quality this game is cheaply made we played 3 times and the tube holding the marbles broke apart I would not buy again	-1
I misplaced a version I purchased several years ago . Today 's model is ultra-cheap.The sticks are too thin and slick , often sliding out of the holes on their own . This makes setup a pain . As a child I used to enjoy placing the sticks in various alignments . Now , unless the sticks are horizontal , they will slide out.The module rocks in the holder , easily causing marbles to drop as you change turns . This makes gameplay annoying for children who are not ultra delicate in their handling of the game.Instead of buying this cheap version I would suggest shopping for a vintage model .	-1
I have 4 kids , 6 yr old , 4 yr old twins and an infant . I wanted something that the older 3 could play together , and something simple and fast . This was definitely something they could have fun with but they can not play with it without an adult . The plastic pieces of the main body do n't fit tight together so if you knock it around , it wobbles and could fall apart . The sticks are flimsy/bendy . When you stick it through the wholes , they bend depending on which hole you put it in ( if not aligned properly ) . And then when there are a lot of sticks already , putting the last few sticks in is a little tougher . Sometimes some of the sticks just fall out so I sort of have to `` stitch '' other sticks in to make sure it 's over and under the others so it does n't just fall out on it 's own.There is a little basin on the bottom for each player . So the tube body part rotates so that when the marbles fall , it falls on that player 's basin . But the frustrating thing is , the whole tube body is wobbly . Just by rotating it , the balls could fall through and mess up the game . So this job is n't for little hands . I have to sit with the kids and rotate it for each player.The other frustrating thing is there is no way to store the game without the marbles and sticks falling out . The box it came in is not a hard one so it 's destroyed once opened . Then the pieces do n't just stack properly in order to just put the marbles and sticks together . There 's just no way easy way of storing it so the pieces do n't get lost .	-1
The pieces are made of only the flimsiest of plastics , barely fit together and the sticks just slide out of the holes on their own . The tower does n't fit properly in the base , making it too easy to pull the tower off kilter . Lastly , the box is just the wrong shape . you have to dismantle the entire contraption to fit it back into the box , but the box is very large . If the box had been made oblong , with the same amount of material , the game could have been left together when stored .	-1
The sticks are not wood they are plastic that bends within minutes of opening the box . This was useless withing a few hours after opening the box .	-1
Like some other reviewers mention , the Ker Plunk game here is an updated version of a classic game beloved by my parents and myself as children . My husband and I were eager to introduce this game to our 5-year-old and thought it would be a fun game to play with as a family . We did have fun , but the two adults ( me and hubby ) found the shoddy construction particularly deplorable.Basically , the game parts consist of two plastic tubes with a plastic connector in between . These three parts are to be manually attached together and stood on the game base which is also made of plastic . The plastic color sticks are then to be inserted through the little holes in the tube connector in a crisscross pattern which will serve to hold the marbles ( which are provided in the box ) .The problems with this game are mainly due to the cheap plastic parts - they are so insubstantial and moving the canister ( for each player 's turn ) is cumbersome as a result and inadvertently jolts the marbles even further . Luckily , my 5-year-old was patient enough with the careful manipulation during each player 's turn , and we did have fun , but we found the overall experience to be underwhelming .	-1
We love games at our house . All kinds of games . But 6 of us here , kids to adults , think this game is dumb . We play Pitch , which is card game with tricks and bidding , Cribbage , Five Crowns , Killer Bunnies , Munchkins , Bananagrams , Labyrinth and Chess ... to give you an idea of the kinds of games that we love and play as much as possible . We love games that increase brain power.My mom loves Uno and so do my kids , but they also did not like Skip Bo . It reminds me very much of Uno , which is not a game I enjoy . It 's like a dumb variation of Uno . We thought the game would never end . Tried it twice , sent to goodwill.I highly recommend Five Crowns over this game . It can be played with kids as young as kindergarten to adult and much more fun and clever .	-1
We love UNO and thought we would like this too . Nope . It has n't caught on . Too complicated and just not fun for the whole family .	-1
NES is the best ever , SNES was great but N64 for me had no games that were nearly as memorible . I enjoyed Doom 64 , WCW/NWO games , MK Trilogy , Goldeneye , Banjo Kazooie and thats about it but again nothing really memorible . The grapics were new at the time but look like total garbage now and I have no desire to play the N64 but I still play NES to this day .	-1
Shes loves it and still plays with it at 2 - she sings along	-1
Bought this for my 3 year old and we loved it for about 5 mins until we realized it came with a small hole in it ! I could only inflate it for a few hours of use before it would just completely deflate ! I was unable to receive any sort of replacement or refund . Not super happy with this !	-1
I got one of the pools that deflates overnight . So sorry because the child I got it for finds it a lot of fun to play in . I have to drain it , blow it up and refill it every day . So the water is always ice cold . I guess I 'll send it back . Disappointing , to say the least .	-1
My son wants to play with this toy , but 2 major problems keep it from being very fun for him . He loves walk-behind toys and always plays with them at other people 's houses . Unfortunately , the handle on this toy slides out easily , so when he tries to pick the toy up and adjust the direction or turn it around , the handle pops right out and he comes running to me to fix it , since he 's too young to slide it in by himself . You can imagine how frustrating this is for him . I put packing tape around the base to hold it in - problem solved but not very gracefully . Why could n't Chicco make the handle snap into place ? ? ? ? Second , the steering . In theory it 's a great idea that this toy has a steering wheel for riding , but it makes it very difficult to play with as a walking toy . You ca n't steer while pushing it , obviously , and whenever he bumps against something it shifts the steering and he ends up pushing in an arc instead of a straight line . In our house that means he 's always running into the walls instead of being able to go straight down the hall . This makes it not much fun for him to push . All that said , he likes the features like the spinning part on top and the compartment in the seat , and he likes to be pushed around on it as well as sit on it and push himself . It 's just useless as a walk-behind toy . If only the steering could be locked straight and the handle snapped into place , this would get a 5 star . Too bad . : (	-1
broken straight out of the box ... I would n't have been so frustrated except that we bought 2 and NEITHER worked . NOT ONE TIME ... both got returned	-1
To begin with , it is difficult to install the batteries . And in less than a week , the remote stopped to work . I got new batteries installed still no luck . I should have read the reviews before I purchased this . It 's a total waste of money .	-1
This toy appears to be good quality and is easy to use and my little boy enjoyed it until it stopped working ... within less then a year of occasional use . Changing out the batteries did not prove to be helpful . It simply `` gave up the ghost '' and was ready for the trash bin . Very disappointing .	-1
This was such a disappointment . Altogether cheaply made ... the roof will NOT stay on , so I finally gave up and told the child it was supposed to be off so she could & # 34 ; clean the stalls. & # 34 ; Flimsy and comes apart every time we lift or move it . Thought Breyer was supposed to be a quality name but would not buy from them again . I would have given one star , but the 8 yr old I bought this for seems to like it when it stays together .	-1
I would consider myself a very lenient judge of toys . I 've never complained when doors fall off , wings fall out , or windows & gates have to be resnapped again & again . I do n't mind that- but what I do mind is buying my daughters 6 Breyer horses & stable set for her 6th birthday and within only 1 week 4 of the 6 are completely broken ... . including the white horse that came with the Glamour Girls ' ranch too . My girls are gentle with their toys and were ready for some `` Real looking Horses . '' So , I bought Breyer horses and as my husband says , `` Never again . '' 3 of the horses legs broke simply from walking them on the carpet ! One of the Rider 's legs snapped off just from being placed on the horse & I ca n't for the life of me get it back on . One of the larger horses lost all it 's tail hair simply from being brushed with the brush it came with . Honestly , these toys are cheap and defective . One of the other Brands of Horses she received held up great . Now , I 'm on the lookout for any more horses from any brand but Breyer . I wish I had been warned about Breyer 's Quality .	-1
My daughter thought this was boring . The stable is nicely made , but the horses are tippy and not usual Breyer quality .	-1
Santa brought this for my animal-loving daughter last year and her frustration with the toy lead to its collecting dust . It falls apart if you so much as bump it and she enjoys moving toys from room to room . I used Superglue to hold it together , which worked reasonably well . The roof does n't stay on at all . Since she needs to remove it for play , that 's a problem , since without the roof , the structure is very weak ( Superglue & all ) .It 's about what you 'd expect for the money . I would recommend searching for a one-piece set with no assembly or a sturdier one , maybe made of wood.I know Breyer is a classic name so I took a chance that the toy would be a better quality than it is . My daughter plays with the horses and the fence but I think after a year of `` My stable broke again ! '' it 's time to take my own advice and find something better.ETA : We eventually resorted to super-gluing it together ... and it still fell apart ( within months ) . It went into the garbage . There are much better options out there .	-1
Purchasing this toy is simply throwing money away . I am astounded at the amount of things breaking on this stable , and the companion truck/trailer set my daughter was given as a gift . The concept and look is great , and the opportunities could have been endless for play if my daughter was not bringing pieces to me one by one from these sets . She is 5 years old and gentle with her toys , but this toy simply can not handle being played with even as intended . There are things we can fix , like the cupola or roof shifting/falling off , but it is also beyond repair where gate/door hinges break . We were without receipts for this item or it would have gone back the first day when the breaking began . We have had a much better experience the Schleich jeep and trailer purchased for her 3 year old sister , but have not found a similar sized stable . Again , these Breyer accessories are a waste of money for use as a toy being so poorly constructed .	-1
I ca n't seem to get the battery casing undone from under the truck unit . I have to send it back . I turned the screw 50 times to the left and it wo n't come off .	-1
The child has to be very close to the truck with the remote in order for it to go . My 20 month old got frustrated with it quickly and now plays with it without the remote . It is soft and wo n't damage walls .	-1
Over the last few years , these Leap Pads have come in and out of my house via various garage sales , gifts , etc.. The kids play with them for a very short time , then tire of them , and off they go to Goodwill.So my kids like them for like a day , and that 's it . It 's just another electronic toy . The little cartridges get lost very easily and then you 're stuck with books that wo n't work.My kids will cuddle up with me and a book everyday , for long periods of time . That 's what little kids books are about : bonding with those who love you while learning . Read you child a book instead of plopping them in front of this thing . Teach them the words with your fingers and your voice , not a stylus and a computerized talking box.We do n't need batteries to teach our kids to read .	-1
I bought this toy on an auction site well below retail prices . I really do n't see what the fuss is about . I think it 's a waist of plastic & paper.The books have very limited value from an educational stand point.If you want a sound effects box ( electronic babysitter ) that your child can mindlessly play with then this is the toy for you.I normally love Leapfrog , but I really believe they missed the mark with this toy . I will be putting our toy immediately back up for auction .	-1
We have had nothing but trouble with this thing . Like other reviewers said the part that lifts up to empty the potty is not convenient . The latches on back to keep it together are very flimsy . The step stool only works when you take the potty apart and turn it upside down . The only time its convenient is if you are ready to move the seat to the adult toilet and use the step stool part as a step stool full time . But the worst part of this thing is the splash guard . My son never played with it . But once it was moved to the big toilet it would often come off and fall into the large toilet all on its own as my son was trying to get down . One day it fell off while I was taking him off the potty and I flushed before I realized it was in there . No , I did n't expect the chair to potty train my child for me but I certainly expected something that would n't fall apart .	-1
This potty has so many flaws.For one , the opening is just tiny . My son ended up pooping all over the seat because of that.For boys the splash guard is a real problem . If you do n't have the splash guard on , of course he pees all out the front , but it flipped right down as my son sat down , so not only did he pee all out the front and on to the floor , he also peed on to the splash guard.It comes apart so easily , and it does n't go back together all that well.And YIKES ! All the places the germs can collect ! There are so many little places for bacteria , both on the inside and outside of this potty.We gave ours away and got the Baby Bjorn potty instead , which is awesome !	-1
My petite 2-year-old daughter fits well on this seat - too bad she 's not ready to potty train yet . My 3-year-old son can barely fit on the seat , much less pee without making a mess on the outside of the seat or the floor . It 's a pain to pull the basin out to dump it - it always seems to stick slightly then jolt , so whatever is inside sploshes out . : ( I opened it completely to clean the inside and could n't believe all the little tight compartments inside , all of which contained urine because of the way the seat jolts when I try to remove the basin . It was a nightmare to clean completely.The top part of the seat is supposed to fit on a normal toilet . It fits on our toilet but wobbles a lot . We tried it at my mom 's house and it did n't fit AT ALL on her seat . We also brought it with us on a trip and tried it on a public toilet ... would n't fit.I bought this seat for less than $ 5 second-hand , so it was no big loss to me . However , I would NOT recommend buying this new . It was more trouble than it was worth .	-1
I bought it and attempted to assemble this potty . The four grips that supposedly anchors the seat cover did not fit the potty and the fit and finish were dismal . So , I returned it . This potty looked great from the picture but is poorly made and the parts did not fit at all . You are better off with another potty .	-1
The Jump-O-Lene inflatable toy received was defective and would not hold air . It appeared that it would have been a great deal of fun if it had stayed inflated . I made DOZENS of attempts to contact CMS Worldwide Sales by phone and e-mail without success to exchange the item well within the 30 day timeframe allotted . Despite Amazon 's assurance of satisfaction and ease of returns it has not helped with the issue either . After reading other reviews concerning CMS it appears I have just thrown $ 50.00 dollars down the drain or rather into CMS Worldwide Sales pockets . I fear sending it back without talking to CMS first as the reviews indicate others who have returned items purchased from CMS have never received compensation or replacement . My recommendation is to be wary , be very wary of making any purchases from this particular vendor/supplier . Just keep looking and you can find several suppliers on line with the same item . CMS offers nothing exclusive and they are not reliable or trustworthy ! ! ! !	-1
I bought this toy for my 2 boys , 4 and 2 , and they loved it . I even bought balls to make a ball pit . The toy is huge which I know everyone said , but you ca n't really get an idea of it 's size until you see it . One bag of balls was definitely not close to being enough , however , before I could even buy more , it got a hole in the middle of the bottom . That was only about two days after putting it up . After that every couple of days a ring would get a hole in it . By the end of about two weeks only one ring was still inflated . I thought about going to get a pool patch kit , but I realized that if I patched one hole another would come somewhere else.Bottom line , if you have the time and patience to look for and patch holes or if you go into it not expecting to have it for long go for it . The kids love it . Maybe your kids wo n't be as hard on it . My girls had one when they were little and it was fine .	-1
My daughter is 40 pounds and I could not get enough air into this so that she did n't hit the ground ( through the inflated bottom ) when jumping . Not so fun . She learned to jump `` lightly , '' but c'mon .	-1
My 2-year-old flipped out of this right away . We took it down after 1 hour . Our 1-year-old almost flipped out too and probably would have , if I kept it up . The walls are simply too low for this to be safe . Flipping out of it , my son snapped his neck . He was fine , but I was worried about what could have happened . Also , the two children crashed into one another all the time , hurting one another . Mainly due to wall height , this is an unsafe product . Sure , it was plenty fun for them . It 's too bad it did not work out.Another thing to note is that there is a strong vinyl smell ( which is supposed to be toxic , right ) ? In addition , the product is very large and did n't really fit anywhere without taking up a whole room . It takes a long time to inflate with an electric pump , so once it 's up , it 's up . Do not buy .	-1
It worked great indoors but when I left it outside during a rainstorm , water found its way into the inflatable rings . So I now have water inside the thing and no way to completely drain it . If I do salvage it , I will keep it indoors from now on . No apparent leak , but it 's obviously not airtight.This could be a great toy indoors . I 'm only warning others that it may not work outdoors.Another issue is that it has a strong chemical odor - the reason I left it outside in the first place .	-1
Wow , I purchased this item from Meijer near my home . Once home , we were ready to get it blown up..NOT ! The smell of this product was so very strong . It was evident that some strong chemicals were used in manufacturing this product . It did not even smell like a new shower curtain type of smell as I 'd expect . Needless to say , it gave me a headache within five minutes of it being opened and we returned it pronto ! My son even started to sneeze when we took it out of the box . I would never consider putting any baby/child in an item that smells that noxious and strong of chemicals of some sort . We even had to open the windows of our home to air out the smell of it after boxing it back up for return..then placing it in the trunk . I 'll keep looking for a better inflatable bouncer or a trampoline .	-1
Many of the pieces are deceptively small ; so small that I worry my 2-year will choke on them . Not to mention - this came with a horrible chemical smell , which is unusual based on other & # 34 ; Melissa & Doug & # 34 ; products that I 've purchased . Between the size of the small pieces and the bad chemical smell , I put this back in a container and shelved it . I am too worried that my son will put a piece in his mouth and either be poisoned by whatever is making it smell so bad or choke on the small pieces . I should have returned it .	-1
As cool as I thought this puzzle was , it is n't . The holes for the letters are very shallow , and they fall out if barely even bumped . And , the actual letters themselves are n't very defined , like the `` m '' and `` w '' . Those two are tricky enough for a toddler , and this puzzle does n't make it any easier . I would go for another puzzle .	-1
I should have looked at the letters in detail before buying this . I bought it for my 2 year old son to learn lower case alphabets . & # 34 ; a & # 34 ; , & # 34 ; d & # 34 ; , & # 34 ; p & # 34 ; , & # 34 ; q & # 34 ; look all the same . & # 34 ; t & # 34 ; looks like a & # 34 ; + & # 34 ; sign . & # 34 ; S & # 34 ; is very poorly defined , unlike what is shown in the picture . & # 34 ; i & # 34 ; and & # 34 ; l & # 34 ; look the same.This is a pathetic puzzle though its colorful and has good pictures . My son will just end up getting confused . To add to it the pieces are made of very thin wood , almost like cardboard . The other puzzle with only upper case letters from Melissa and Doug is perfect , but this is a waste of money . If you are looking for lower case alphabets , do n't buy this !	-1
I thought this product looked good on the website . I own the set that only has capital letters and it was fine . But I was very disappointed with this particular set . The letters are all cut unevenly , and I got splinters from handling this almost immediately . I had to scrape off the wooden splinters from each of the letters before letting the kids play with them.As far as play goes , it works better as a teaching tool when it is unopened . Once you take the letters out , the board looks very busy as there is a lot of illustration underneath each letter . It is difficult to see the slots where the letters are supposed to go , and my 2 year olds lost interest in it fairly quickly as a result . I am considering outlining every letter with a sharpie or something so they can see where the slots are.The letters are also kind of poorly cut . For example it is hard to tell a `` u '' from an `` n '' , and a `` d '' from a `` p '' . The `` i '' and `` l '' also look too similar . It 's just not a good set for teaching purposes.As it would take too much trouble to return this , I might end up buying the Hape - Lowercase Alphabet Stand Up Puzzle . I do n't think it matters much though , they will learn the letters eventually and do n't need any particular tools to get to that point . This was just a splurge item .	-1
My triplets received this toy for Christmas when they were 6 months old . We did n't bring it out until they were 8 months old . My daughter and son were very disturbed by the loud music and clanking blocks that continually were flying all over . ( My other son just stared at it . ) I could n't believe it ! They are not fearful kids ! I put it away and brought it out 3 months later ... as soon as they heard the music ... they ran ! At this point I started to really look at the toy . It has no educational value , the same song is played and it simply spins . They enjoy toys that do more than & quot ; one & quot ; thing ! I do not recommend this toy . It is so repetitive and meaningless . I ca n't believe some of the reviewers actually like the music ! It has ONE song ... how exciting is that to hear over and over and over ? Sorry Fisher Price , I usually LOVE your toys . Not this one .	-1
First off it was sooo hard to put together and then it was cracked on the bottom so i had to send it bac and when i got the new one together it was not at all what i expectited ! ! The radio is horrible ! - the handle that is suppose to let me push her stinks cause the front wheels go whereever they want to not where i want - and the same when she is trying to push it with her feet while she is in it . I hate it its worth a try for yourself . I def.dont think its worth the money tho .	-1
My 18 mo daughter received this for Christmas . She loved riding in it . However , I do n't understand how Little Tikes could make such a toy on wheels , and the only way in is to CLIMB in ( or have a parent put you in . ) So , we could not leave the toy out for her to play with , as it was such a danger to her . She is not yet able to climb very well , and the thing IS ON WHEELS . We have lots of hard floors for her to fall on . And , as so many people have already said , it totally needs a seatbelt . We exchanged this for the original Cozy Coupe , and she loves it just as much ! She loves having a door to open and close , and the hard top prevents her from standing up .	-1
Could not figure out how to play this game . When we went by the directions , it was boring . Would not recommend this game .	-1
My son enjoys this , but it wo n't hold air for long . The plug does not fit well and allows the ball to deflate quickly . Pretty serious design flaw in my opinion .	-1
It is too small for my seven year old grandson . We will save it for his brother maybe when he turns two or three he can play with it .	-1
I think this is OK . It looks like more fun then it actually is . my kids get excited to use it and then after about 30 seconds they have moved on . It is not easy to stay on and bounce . i have a daycare and over think it is a waste of money .	-1
After blowing it up , it was smaller than expected . It also was coated in some oil or grease . Very gross ! Definitely would not buy again .	-1
they put size that was perfect for my kids , they could not bounce on it so I returned this product because both my kids who are small could not use it even though the size should have worked	-1
I really did n't like this toy . It is nonfunctioning as both a walking toy and a riding one . As a walker , there is n't enough room for a child 's feet when they are walking with it in front of them . As a rider and walker , it does n't roll very well . I just did n't like this at all . It also does n't have as many activities on it as many other walking and riding toys . I would not recommend anyone buy this .	-1
This toy is somewhat cheaply made . It has n't broken , but it is light and flimsy . The wheels are just plastic on plastic and do n't turn well . The concept of a non walking baby walking behind this in the upright position is not a good one . They ca n't do that . and after they walk they wo n't either . My grandson just pushes it like a giant car , from the side . and crawls up to it and pushes it again . and that is about it . Not much to do for a baby .	-1
While I have no real problems with the toy itself other then the fact its made in China ( which is why I would NEVER have bought it on my own ) we received this as a gift that my in-laws purchased at a charity event ( it was not purchased here at Amazon ) . When we went to assemble the toy a couple of pieces were missing , the front handle & the decals for the `` spinner '' . I went online & found parts were readilly available through Hasbro ( they make Playskool toys ) . I ordered the parts & they came in a few weeks then the `` fun '' began - the dolts shipped me the wrong decal sheet which I figured could be easily remedied with a single call yet here we are several months later & half dozen phone calls to their customer NO service dept . Every time I call I get a new excuse ( lie ? ) as to why the replacement hasnt even been shipped yet , you would think this would be a simple fix NOT ! I think my wife has the reason we havent gotten the decals pinned down - they probably have to come from China ! Anyway I know it seems petty but when it comes time to give the toy to a needy child or charity ( which we do with all of the baby items we no longer use ) it would be really nice to give it to them 100 % complete .	-1
This toy seems to be a good idea , but does n't perform . In walker mode it tips too easily for learners and in ride-on mode the child 's foot gets stuck on the little antenna on the back . Takes up space and never got played with . I have twins and babysit triplets and still it did n't get much use .	-1
I bought this walk n ride for my youngest when she was almost ready to walk ( about 11 months ) . She would n't fool with it too much but instead use the shopping cart I had when my oldest was young . She preferred the shopping cart even though it moved more quickly but she would always reach for the shopping cart first . I still have the walk n ride but its sitting in the backyard . I seem to remember her feet tripping on the wheels while using as a walker . I think there are better walkers out there .	-1
We bought this for our daughter when she was around 11 months and standing but not walking . She used it mainly in her room on carpet . The toy is really light so in the `` push mode '' she managed to build up a lot of speed in a small space . A couple of times she tipped it over . She really seemed to prefer to push around a jumbo sized pampers box . Now she is walking she hardly looks at this toy . She is tall so when she does sit on it in `` car mode '' she is too big to push forward - she can only push backwards which seems to get old really fast . Considering all this and the amount of space this toy takes up , if I had to do it over I would probably pass .	-1
My daughter pays no attention to this toy what so ever . She ca n't walk with it becuase it either falls apart or it trips her . I 'm just not all that impressed .	-1
We received this as a gift when our daughter was 11 months old . She was already at that time quite proficient at `` cruising '' , that is , walking assisted by furniture , etc . She was basically walking on her own two weeks after we got this . I was hoping it would be a big help to her , and fun , until she got to the point where she could walk steadily on her own ( you know , around 18 months or so ) . The thing is , this toy , as a `` walker '' is very poorly designed : the wheels go so fast when they push it that is just flies out from under her every time she tried to push it . She quickly lost any interest in it . Even as a `` car '' toy , the same problem . Many walker toys have a simple mechanism that prevent the wheels from turning too fast so that baby does fall on her face as toy shoots out from under her across the floor.I really ca n't see paying more than $ 3 for this at a yard sale . It is , in my humble opinion it is an overpriced piece of Made-in-China plastic JUNK . An insult to the land-fill it will inevitably end up in . No thanks !	-1
We were very excited to receive the Playskool Walk n ' Ride as a gift for our ( at the time ) 11 month old dd . She was n't quite walking yet and could n't wait for her to be able to use the Walk n ' Ride to keep her on her feet.We did not find it that difficult to put together , however it did take some time ( I might suggest putting together before actually giving it as a gift to child ) - dd was uninterested by the time we finished putting it together.Our daughter was able to push toy without the problem that some other reviewers listed as & quot ; not enough room for the feet & quot ; . She did however have some difficulty turning the toy in a different direction . Because it was so heavy , she had to use all her might to turn sideways . And do to it 's bulkiness , we found that she could only play with it in large open areas . Since she was a winter baby , this meant moving the kitchen table to the side of the dining room , just so she could play.As she progressed we thought maybe we 'll give the & quot ; ride & quot ; part a try . I was equally disappointed with this feature . Due to the & quot ; bulkiness & quot ; of the toy she had a difficult time swinging her little legs over the toy to get on and off . Also when she sat on it correctly the handle was so close to her chest it really did n't look comfortable and did n't allow for her to get much leverage to push the toy forward.On a positive note , some of the sight-touch-sound features ( such as the flexible antenna , spinning drum , clicking gear ) did provide some pleasure for dd . Also , the toy seem to be sturdy enough that dd very seldom tipped it over.All-in-all I would save your money on this one .	-1
Bought this for my 13 month old as she has started cruising . Turn out the walker is so light , she could not hold on to it and walk without falling forward . She would play it for less than 5 minutes and not take a second look at it for the rest of the day.Overall , I would not recommend this for toddlers learning to walk .	-1
I bought this for my daughter at 9 mos . She was already pulling up and cruising on furniture . I thought this would be helpful for her to get around the other areas of the house with my help . Unfortunately , it 's very unsturdy and the wheels go quickly . There is n't any resistance for beginning walkers , so they will lean on the walker and it will shoot forward . I thought using it on the carpet ( rather than our wood floors ) might help , but no difference.By reading the description , it sounds like a great transition toy . I think you should save the money and just use an overturned box or laundry basket . Same effect.The only upside is that she enjoys the car mode when I push her . Perhaps she will grow into this toy once she walks independently . However , I think that defeats the purpose and description of this toy . It 'll sit and gather dust until she wants to ride on it .	-1
I do n't use the car portion because it 's too small for my children ( my 14 month old is 33 inches tall ) .The walker seems better on carpet , but slides too much on hardwood floors . There is n't enough space between the base of the toy and the baby 's foot so the walker part is n't really functional either . I 'm going to have to give this toy up .	-1
I bought this for my daughter because she was just beginning to cruise and needed to develop some confidence . As a walker this toy works pretty well . My daughter pushed it all over the house , and it seemed to help her gain the confidence to become a walker . Once she was walking fully , she pushed it all over for the fun of pushing.As a rider , this toy has real drawbacks . Like another reviewer said , the wheels are too close together , so her legs hit the back wheels when moving forward . Also , they do n't spin very well . This is great when walking because it slows the unit down , but my daughter found it very frustrating to ride because she could n't go anywhere without a lot of effort.The gadgets are a mixed blessing . The spinners and clickers are great , but the antenna on the back gets in the way ( especially when you convert it to a riding toy ) , and my daughter was actually reduced to tears on a couple of occasions because her leg kept getting stuck when she tried to get off.If you 're going to get it , do n't pay full price . I donated mine to daycare .	-1
This toy has been through both of my kids now and I 've had the same experience with both : this toy is just fine as a `` riding/scooting '' toy but is terrible as a `` learn to walk '' toy . The problem is there is very little to no resistance in the wheels so as soon as you begin to push on the handle , it goes rolling . This is useless for a child that still needs some help balancing as he/she begins to learn how to walk since as soon as the kid puts any weight on it , it shoots forward . This is probably a larger problem on my hardwood floors but I ca n't see it being significantly better on carpet.The good side of the toy is that it is well sized for a riding toy . The handle is place well and my kids were/are able to get on and off easily by themselves .	-1
I was surprised at so many positive reviews for this product . It is cute but the design was terrible . the back wheels come out too far so our daughter was constantly tripping over them . also , as a scooter the front bars roll forward so there is little room for the child to sit , plus not back so children easy slip off the back . also hard to get on the scooter with the little purple thing sticking out of the back . we have a tall child so maybe that is why .	-1
I am sorry but I have to write a review again on this ... .Most parents already have the common sense to assist your child when starting out with this toy and supervise them with it ... .that does not need to be told . Bottom line is that this toy [ stinks ] in my opinion ! My daughter who is 10 months old and walking along furniture and everrything was walking with this toy ( WHILE BEING SUPERVISED ... THANK YOU ) and next thing we knew the walker fell sideways and landed on top of her ! It rolls too too easily and we have decent carpeting here too . This purchase was a mistake ! I am sorry I bought it . There are much sturdier walkers out there and also equipped with better activities than this one !	-1
Poor lady , in our house , sits relegated to the corner of the play room . For some reason , this is not one of my son 's favorite engines ... he has so many to pick from , and she never gets chosen to haul the other coaches ... .	-1
Thought I was getting a normal sized toy . it is inches and also cheaply made.so very disappointing , not worth the time to order , and smelled like fromaldihide to boot , yes it is made in China	-1
This toy actually has gotten a `` thumbs down '' by the Oppenheim Toys Portfolio ( that just cracks me up ) . The music is a little too loud ; it just does n't have that awesome spin action that I remember as a kid . Seems pretty tough . We got it for free- if you are in the market for one , I would pursue other alternatives .	-1
Not like our old heavy duty sit'n spin . Super flimsy and the handle pops out of the base easily while my 30 # , 4 year old attempts to turn the handle . I would not recommend wasting your money .	-1
I really wish they had regular sit and spins without any musical abilities . The music that plays on this toy is worse than nails on a chalkboard , I immediately took the batteries out . My daughter likes it , and there is no sound ( thank goodness ) .	-1
I remember enjoying these as a kid and our family had one for years . When some gave us this one I thought it was pretty neat but WOAH is that music LOUD , there is no volumn control and while I 'm not a prude and want only quiet toys , contrary , I want toys that will stimulate young minds so I do n't mind noise but this thing IS LOUD ! So I put some tape over the 2 speakers ( LOOKS like there are 4 but music only comes from 2 ) I put tape over the speakers and wah-la just the right volume now.But I read why people rated this negatively . And I am glad , I thought it was just my imagination -- -but it 's TRUE , this must be smaller than the original version I grew up with . At 18 months I tried to help my daughter spin on it yet for her to sit on it her chest would rub the steering wheel.By 2 she could spin it herself but would risk a tumble with each turn as she tried to balance herself on the small base and still manuever the steering wheel.A big turnoff is portability . To pick this up and move it you have to hold the bottom end otherwise it falls off the handle , perhaps it was meant to screw in and ours is missing a screw ? Anyway , if someone wants to buy one cheap then I know where you can get one haha .	-1
Rounded edges..difficult to set up trails and knock'em down ... disappointed in this puchase.They r nice for the traditional game , but my kids nor I am interested .	-1
The stones in the set were damaged and not as advertised . The description for & # 34 ; Gemstone Playing Pieces & # 34 ; is misleading . What I received was just cracked glass . The board is also of extremely poor quality and feels very rough and unfinished . To make matters worse , I ordered two of these .	-1
I have played hundreds of different games , and the game play for this one is one of the worst . It has too few playing spaces on the board , it has paper bills but almost none are used , there is no excitement in playing , almost all luck in who wins so little thinking is involved , each timed played is about the same , no interaction ( play ) between players , and there does not seem that any leaning can be accomplished . The quality is good , and the plastic coins can be used for something else .	-1
We got these for our 3 year old and much to my dismay , the sticks lose their capacity to lock in with the round pieces after one use . Now they can be inserted but they fall right out . I am really disappointed in the quality and value of the toy .	-1
Not sure where the 5 stars are coming from but the quality of these Tinkertoys are no way they were when we were kids . Some holes too big , not drilled deep enough , holes too big so pieces fall out . Quality control is awful and will not buy again . Note 'Made in China ' which may be where the quality has gone .	-1
I am surprised by the positive reviews of this toy by those who purchased it for a 3-5 year old . I bought it for my 3 year old ( a very large boy & normal strength ) He is unable to fit the pieces together . I have trouble with many . They fit VERY tight . He has broken several pieces by trying to shove them in or pull them apart . Other pieces fit much too loose.What it has come down to is this ... . '' mom can you please build me something with the Tinkertoys ? `` Um ... .I have a better idea son , let 's go buy a toy you can actually play with yourself . This is not the toy I remember from my youth .	-1
I bought this toy for my 9 month old daughter . Convinced she would love it . I have tried for almost a month now to get her interested in this toy to no avail . Other than chewing on the ice cubes & pail she could care less about it . For that I could have just bought her plastic blocks to chew on that are far cheaper . Also , now that she is crawling she tried to pull herself up on it and it is so weightless it toppels over . I disagree with the manufacturer recommended age . This would probably be a much better toy for a 2-3 year old child that understands the kitchen and pretend play .	-1
My son wanted a wallet of his own . At the time , this had good ratings . This could not even fit into an adults back pocket . My child enjoys throwing the plastic coins around , but other than that , it has not interested him . The wallet is poorly made , the coins are cheap , the money is flimsy paper and the id and credit card is the thinnest cardboard you could imagine . If you actually put the coins in the wallet the zipper breaks . It is ugly as well . Buy something else .	-1
The item is as listed and looks as pictured . My only complaint is it was missing the slotted spoon . I hate not getting what I paid for .	-1
The price seemed right and the amount of pieces as well but I did n't think it would have been so flimsy . If I knew I would have bought a different brand . My son seems to like it so far though .	-1
This xylophone would be great , except one of the keys is out of tune . It 's so annoying , you ca n't play any basic song , nothing sounds right all because of one little off note . Otherwise I would really like this toy .	-1
My grandkids absolutely love this sand box from Amazon . In spite of the good plastic molding , the tight fitting cover and the looks/utility of the sand box , I had a problem which is why I gave it only 2 stars . When I received it , I bought some fine white sand and the kids played in it for several days including a small amount of water . At the time , we had been having weeks of extremely hot 80/90 degree days and this may have contributed to the problem . Every time after they were through playing in it , I installed the cover which goes on easy and this keeps out any critter that want to use it as a potty box . Here 's the problem , Mold ! The sand turned green because there was no air circulating and I think it was a combination of several factors , dampness , heat , no air , no sun light etc . As I said , the box is very nice but maybe the lid needs some holes drilled in it for ventilation but then how do you keep the rain out . The kids are mad at me now for taking the crabbie away but I think playing in mold could lead to many bad things later on .	-1
First , let me say this game is fun if you are playing on a quality game board with quality playing pieces.Othello is a great game for young children . The rules are easy to learn and this game provides a solid education in basic strategy.However , I set aside my own nostalgia for this game and looked at the reality of what 's inside the box.Here 's the negatives : This game board is cheap.The poor construction means poor durability ; the faux felt is already peeling away from the board.The board is designed so tight that the game pieces almost have to be snapped into place when you flip them.The game pieces are thinner and harder to pick up , especially for older hands ( beware grandparents ) .Steer clear of this version from Mattel . See if you can find a better quality version of the game . It makes a difference.Message to Mattel : I 'd rather pay the extra $ 10- $ 15 for you to provide better-quality materials . Cheap construction like this makes me think twice about buying your other games .	-1
This toy is of pretty good quality but your really need about 20 feet to get anything out of it . I have 10 foot ceilings and it will not deploy even if I stand at the ceiling . I imagine it will be fine when it warms up and I can climb a light pole but , not really that great .	-1
This does not work at all unless you throw it off a mountain . At home , it just goes up like a lump and comes down the same . Very disappointed . If I were n't so lazy , I would have returned it .	-1
Seemed like a great toy , but then when it was being thrown in the air outside , the body gave a clean break off from the head . It does n't have the weight it needs to work properly without the head .	-1
1 . DOES NOT FLY OR PERFORM AS ADVERTISED.2 . YOUR CHILDREN WILL PROBABLY BE DISAPPOINTED AS MY SON IS3 . MY SON WRAPPED IT AROUND HIS BIKE HANDLE BAR IN ATTEMPTS TO GET IT TO FLY AND IT DOES MINIMALLY , BUT CLEARLY NOT AS SHOWN IN OVERSTATING , OVER ADVERTISED PHOTO SHOOT TO TRY TO SALE THIS PRODUCT .	-1
Too heavy to & # 34 ; float & # 34 ; down . The man on it is a bit too big and heavy . You 'd have to drop it from a really big height for the parachute to open . I had high hopes for this because my son LOVES to make parachute 's out of bags ( course the do n't really work ) and he loves the cheapy parachute men he got at a birthday party ( but they tangled too easily ) .This does n't tangle , and the idea/design is good , just need a little better man to go with it .	-1
I just received this doll today and am not sure if it is faulty - the doll 's right hand is not the one described and in photos - the thumb and forefinger are more closed-up and will not stay in the baby 's mouth . i do notice that another model of Babipouce - the grenadine - seems to show a photo with the same closed hand ... so I 'm not quite sure what is going on . Both models obviously have the open mouth for thumb-sucking ... it seems pointless to have an open mouthed doll if their finger wo n't stay in - it just looks weird ! The doll is otherwise sweet and I know my 9 month old will love it ( when she gets the right one ! ) . Maybe they out the wrong hand on this model ? I 'm sending it back , I will update once I have a resolution.UPDATE : I was pleased with Amazon 's `` call me now '' customer service feature , and promptly got a representative on the line . He assured me that the Amazon photo is the most up-to-date and that my doll had been faulty . I was sent another doll 2-day shipping and received it in one day , hooray ! only problem - it 's the same exact doll with the closed hand , NOT the one pictured with an extended pointer-finger and thumb . I went to a local toy store , saw the same Babipouce there , with the same closed right hand . OH well , I threw in the towel and gave the doll to my 9 month-old daughter . She liked it right away , and loves to touch the doll 's nose and mouth . In the long run , it probably wo n't matter much the doll 's hand does n't go in her mouth ... it just irks me . Maybe this change in hand-mold has something to do with the big `` warning - choking hazard '' at the top of the product description . If it 's safer this way , so be it ! Ironically , I took care of a friend 's 3 year old daughter today , who took one look at Babipouce 's open mouth and said `` do you have a bottle for that ? '' No , ma'am , I do n't ; )	-1
Overall very cute . Daddy stepped on it a few days later and the entire thing broke . Guess the kids will learn to pick up their toys now..	-1
The beds are cute , but I had to finally convince my 3 year old not to try to stack them . They are just too hard to stack - you have to be very precise with how you fit them into each other .	-1
This kitchen is ok , but there are much better kitchens out there . The biggest problem is that the oven door and dishwasher door are hinged at the bottom , not the side . It 's awkward for me to open the doors , let alone my daughter . It 's also small , which I liked when I was looking , but I 've found that my daughter really prefers slightly larger kitchens ( she likes to reach ) with doors that are hinged on the side ( she loves to open and close the doors ) . I 'm going with a wood kitchen for the next version and sticking this one outside in the playhouse .	-1
The apron is too stiff . I have two of these , and my kids do not like wearing them . Also , my daughter 's hair gets into the velcro , and gets stuck there all the time - it 's a pain to take the hair out while she is screaming .	-1
Harder to get into than I first thought . The kids are anxious to get to `` work '' and fidget getting into this , the arms are a bit too tight . It seems bulky as well . Better off going old school - daddy 's old shirt on backwards !	-1
Not worth the money ; poor quality , too lightweight . I thought it would be a lot nicer because I like the company .	-1
We used these crayons last night , they were normal drawing during bath time , and they worked fine . Tonight my son went to use them and they would not draw at all . I noticed they had been dripping dye and ran them under water and the dye rushed out of where it had filled in the plastic container . I guess getting them wet the previous night made all of the dye get drawn ( no opponent intended ) out of the crayons leaving crayons with no useable dye left in them . Horrible quality , definitely not what bath crayons are like ( we 've used plenty other brands in past years this was just a quick pick )	-1
We have the set by the same name brand that come in a fish that holds the markers . They are great ! We bought these as replacements to put in the fish ... they are HORRIBLE ! ! ! They fall apart when my daughter tries to draw and the sponge that is meant for cleaning the marker ... all it does is smear it ! HORRIBLE ! ! ! My daughter LOVED the 1st set ! Used them in the tub at least once a day until they were nubs ! I dont know whats was wrong with this set ? ! ?	-1
OMG ! The SMELL ! ! ! It is horrible ! I can not sit with in 6 feet of an open can -- it makes my eyes water.The paint works , and washes off well and all that , but OMG again -- -- oh that smell ! I had to put these to rest in the garbage after 4-5 uses -- I could not take the irritation any longer !	-1
The box came opened and the paint was rolling around my package thank goodness they did n't spill and get on my other stuff	-1
The green bottle of paint had already been opened before I received this item , and it was all over the outside of the other bottles . It was too much trouble to complain about , so I did not return them . I will not order them again online .	-1
I have a 2.5 yo who LOVES to paint . To keep the mess to a minimum we paint nearly every day in the bathtub . What I liked about these are the colors and the variety . And they are very , very washable . They instantly clean off skin and our ( sucky ) bathfitters tub better than the squeezable tube crayola paints which have no smell but require a LOT of scrubbing ( especially the red ) BUT the good ends there . These STINK ! After using the squeeze ones , I was shocked how much and how strongly these smell.These smell like acrylic paints or a poorly ventilated nail salon . Even my husband ( who has a masters in art so he knows paint ) asked when he first smelled these if I 'd made a mistake and given her HIS paints . And he had to come in the bathroom to take over for me because they smelled so strong they caused me to have an asthma attack ! So since we use these in a confined space ( bathroom ) where we ca n't guarantee a great cross-breeze , we gave these away after the first time to a friend who does store window decorations . His response ? Thanks , but , wow do those SMELL STRONG ! I ca n't believe they are non-toxic ! Or safe for a little one with little lungs to breathe in . Or have on their skin ! Or mouth ! They rinsed right down and we will not use these ever again . I can not take the risk of another asthma attack.BTW my friend said they have no smell when dry .	-1
This ruined 2 pairs of my girls pants , lucky they had no shirts on . I tried washing multiple time and even washed them right away after they finished painting and now the pants are stained with paint .	-1
Got this for baby when she was 2 months . She 's now 9 months Hoping she 'd learn to love it , but she never has . It does n't make enough noise or 'do ' anything . One of her least favorite toys . I 'm disaapointed , because she LOVES her clutch cube .	-1
Kids used it one time . Color was mixed and very stiff even after we bagged it right after being done with it .	-1
I got these markers for my 18 month old . I know she is below the recommended age , but she loves to color and we just got a new house with white everywhere , so I thought I could n't go wrong with these ! I was wrong.The colors are very dull and not true to the lid color . Not at all as nice as the other crayola colors . It takes a few seconds for the color to appear after you color . This few seconds was too long for my daughter . Once the color showed up , she did n't make the connection between her coloring and the color that appeared 3 seconds later.I am an art professor and so is my husband , and I found it hard to stay in the lines while coloring because of the delay . This is pretty ironic and hysterical , but I could have paid the same amount of money on real art supplies with real results . All we got out of this gift was some huge laughs about how even professional artists could n't operate these markers ! Buy your kiddo some washable markers and regular paper instead .	-1
I was really disappointed with this . It comes it a basic and flimsy plastic container , the items described on the outside cover of the container were not the items in the container . The items in it were mini size and the & # 34 ; projects & # 34 ; given to make we 're boring very very boring and with the mini size items supplied it made it difficult to make the boring items . The price your paying for this makes it a bigger rip off .	-1
This is the weirdest assortment of craft stuff I have ever seen . It had the 8 count crayons and the cheep , green Crayola kiddie scissors . I was expecting there to be more than just crayons for drawing utensils , but that was all that it had . No colored pencils . No thin markers . At least it came with a crayon sharpener .	-1
I have had two sets of these given my kids at different times and they were a big disappointment . A great idea but these ones are essentially expensive bingo dabbers and the tips came off very quickly and the paint flowed everywhere.I found Alex to make a much better version and they have lasted us a long time , despite the fact that they are much smaller than the do-a-dot ones . Although the do-a-dot books are good ( thick paper , interesting themes ) , I have found the Melissa & Doug 's Jumbo Coloring Pads to be excellent quality and over-all much better value considering their price point on amazon .	-1
Maybe I did n't read properly , I will check the description . Do n't buy these for toddlers because they are 100 % not washable off hands ... what a disaster : - (	-1
my 2 yr old loved stamping with these , but when he was done we started to clean up and he had ink stains left all over his hands , he is not a big fan of dirty hands , so he was not pleased .	-1
My son was about one when we bought this for him . He had zero interest in using it as it is made to be used . The balls were all over ( a couple are missing now ) and the hammer is mainly used for other things . We thought he would `` grow into it , '' but at two and a half , he still has no interest in it 's real function . For around the same price we could have gotten a more interesting Plan ball & hammer toy that he would have enjoyed more .	-1
I have purchased many Melissa & Doug products and the quality is usually excellent . However this puzzel is poorly made ... .at least the one I got is . The pieces are not clean cut so they are difficult to put together . And on many of the pieces the paper picture on the front is loose and peeling off the cardboard backing . That 's the condition straight out of the plastic bag in the box . It 's not like we have made this puzzle 10 times or anything . I purchased another one of these ( Solar system floor puzzle ) but have n't opened it yet . It better be of a higher quality than this one or I 'll return them both .	-1
I have four toddler grandchildren . Their response to this toy was to open the box , remove all the pieces , and then get another toy with more interest .	-1
These come all stuck together in a grid , so after you pull them apart they have sharp bumps along the edges .	-1
I bought these to replace a different set of pattern blocks . These do n't work with the cards as they are much smaller , I 'm sure I 'll find a use sometime , but I was really disappointed	-1
The stethoscope is very tight fitting for my 4 1/2 yr old grandsons and they can not hear the actual heartbeat -as advertised . Disappointed in this product and it 's advertising .	-1
While it works as it 's intended function , there is a metal ring that screws on and holds that white circular material over the part you put on someone to listen to . That ring pops off if you look at it wrong and we thought for some time we would n't find the ring part after it happening while we ( mommy & daddy ) were on a date and our sons grandpa and grandma did n't catch him set it down somewhere when it came apart for the 100th time.Thankfully we found the part , and I used a liberal amount of super glue to keep it from coming off again but I should have to super glue something that I just bought .	-1
I really love Little Tikes normally . In fact , we practically have one of everything . However , this particular kitchen is awful . The phone would not stay on the side of the kitchen , which was really a disappointment . My daughter would get so frustrated every time the base would come off . The top of it constantly came off as well . The other thing that was disappointing is the it does not have a dishwasher and fridge like the upgraded model has . The only great thing about it was that it could fit nicely into a corner . This was not enough to keep it though . We took this little tikes nightmare right back to the store after many attempts at making it work . My recommendation would be to spend the extra few dollars and get the nicer one . You can get the other one on sale for just dollars more then this one 's regular price . It was definately the right move for us .	-1
When my 3.5 year old saw the box he immediately wanted to try it out and go fishing . He first tried it without a battery installed and was able to manage it ok . The fishing poles like to swing a lot when you move them , so he had to hold the rod at the midpoint just to keep it still enough to get it in the fish 's mouth . Now , once I installed the battery ( 1 C battery ) and turned it on , the difficulty increased dramatically . The game spins fairly fast and the fish do n't have their mouths open for very long . Trying to hook one on a swinging fishing pole can become a little frustrating , even for me . Now I love a challenge , but if the playability of the game is more of a frustration than it is fun , then the game has lost its appeal . The parts are cheaply made and I would n't be surprised if it did n't last very long . Out of the box , a number of the fish 's stickered eyes had either fallen off or were missing.It 's a good game in that it helps to refine motor skills , but the application and construction of the game is a little too frustrating and disappointing to make it a worth while game.and he had to hold them still This game is a little frusThere are four plastic fishing poles that pivot and rock when you move it . You lower the pole over the fishes mouth and wait for it to open , but the fishing poleTo clear up a few things : 1 ) The game uses 1 C battery , not 2 AAs . 2 ) There is no music as stated in the product description . 3 ) The fishing pole and fish are not magnetic as in other , smaller , wind-up versions of this game.My biggest complaints are that it spins a little too fast , which means that the fish do n't keep their mouths open for very long . And because the fishing pole is two plastic pieces with a small cone/cup shaped plastic knob ( which is only a little smaller than the fish 's mouths ) instead of a magnet on a string as in the small , wind-up versions , catching fish is n't all that easy . It 's not terribly hard , as I got the hang of it in a few minutes , but it 's definitely not as easy as in the magnetic versions.Lastly , the reason some people have trouble putting the game back into its box is because some of the fish are still in their & # 34 ; up & # 34 ; positions ( sticking up , with their mouths open ) . You just need to rotate it manually until all fish are in their & # 34 ; down & # 34 ; positions . But be sure to only rotate it the way the thing normally rotates , though , otherwise you might damage it .	-1
I was hoping this would be fun for my 3 and 4 year old . I 'm always looking for something to play as a family . This was a disappointment . It turns too fast and is really loud . It 's so hard to get the fish for a 3 and 4 year old . My one son has special needs , and it bothers him to have the fish go so fast and hearing the noise the game makes . We never play it .	-1
This is not like the game I grew up with . The fish break VERY easily which is almost impossible to do with younger children . I would look for another game !	-1
This game was fun for my child while it lasted . The problem is after only a few uses , it started to fall apart . This toy would of rated higher for fun had it not started to auto-destruct from use . Sadly , it has joined the rest of the inferiorly made games at the dump .	-1
I got this for my 10 year old , and she could n't compress it in the slightest . Even I had trouble making it pump up and down . Probably meant for expert adults .	-1
The pogo came assembled and ready to rock but golly is it ever hard to bounce ! I thought my kid was just too small but I could n't even get it to really bounce either . My friend ordered the exact same pogo for her son ( 8 years old , like mine ) and had the same problem . Kind of a shame because it is not so flimsy like other pogos I 've seen but the kids ca n't really use it . I would return it but we pounded all over the street trying to make it work so it is no longer unused . Total disappointment and I am out 50 bucks .	-1
I purchased this particular model for a 10-yr. old boy who was within the suggested weight range . It made a terrible noise of metal-on-metal rubbing and did n't seem to bounce back as freely as it should have . I had puchased two different pogo sticks for other kids at the same time and they ran a lot more smoothly without the horrible noise . I think the unit we got was probably defective , so we returned it to amazon . It appears to be a well-constructed model for younger children .	-1
My daughter wanted a pogo stick soooo bad for her 9 birthday , so I purchased this . I think she has only played with it about 5 times in a year . Not worth the money to me , but if you have a kid who loves these things , then I suppose it would be a good one to buy . It 's fairly solid and sturdy ... certainly nothing wrong with it other than my kids lost interest in it quickly .	-1
The pool came with leaks , and does n't stay inflated for more than an hour . I followed the directions perfectly to avoid damaging it in the setup . It 's not worth it to have a pool if you have to constantly refill the air ( especially considering the fact that the ring with the leak ca n't have any water pressure on it while blowing it up ) .	-1
I 'm bummed , I love the pool in the picture , and wanted it specifically to use as a ball pit for a party that is yellow and red themed ( curious george ) ... I was sent this pool instead : Intex Kiddie Pool Summer SunsetThere is no mention in the description that the designs vary.Pool is same size and stuff and will work- buts its not what is in the photo the seller has up .	-1
Okay , I used this indoors on carpet filled with plastic ball-pit balls and pillows and it would not hold air in several of the individual tubes . It was in the trash after only two months of use . Cheap because it is cheaply made .	-1
I opened the box , set up the pool ( very easy ) and began filling . I came back to check on it , and realized it would n't fill past about the halfway mark because there was a 15-inch crack in the side . So I drained it and mailed it right back . My kids were very disappointed . Amazon 's return process was very easy though .	-1
We put this pool on our grass , which admittedly is n't the softest grass in the world , but I thought the pool would have lasted longer than one use . It had multiple holes after the first use . Also , the sides do n't stay up very well and buckle with only 6 & # 34 ; of water in the pool . You get what you pay for . If you decide to purchase this pool make sure you put something under it . We will be going back to a hard plastic pool next summer .	-1
This thing went right in the trash two day 's after installation . Maybe I did n't follow the directions properly . dunno .	-1
Well this was a disappointment . My husband purchased the Intex Dolphin , it arrived quickly , we blew it up and it lasted just one day before it developed not one but two leaks . With two leaks we figured it was n't even worth trying to keep on top of this situation.So ca n't recommend this float . It looked sturdy enough but could n't survive being used by one 12 year old girl : ( Pam T~ ( This product by Intex , which does n't cost much more , was far superior -Intex River Run Tube )	-1
It is a sturdy toy but my two granddaughters were unable to ride . They just roll off . Good thing it was less than $ 10.00 . Agree with previous review . Do n't waste your money .	-1
This is HUGE ! It is very back heavy as the front is high . More important ... It is BLACK . In the hot sun , the orca turns into a dangerous animal , scalding to the touch and completely unusable . It is very well made however !	-1
Very disappointed in this product . Everything is very cheaply made and I would not trust putting any samples in these containers . Junk ! Just buy the real thing	-1
There is nothing in the kit that is worth what you may pay for it . Vague and very brief instructions . Best visit library and then internet to obtain suitable materials to make slides . You simply can not learn to make the many types of slide and mounts from this too basic of a kit .	-1
This is a bit too complicated for my 10 yr old daughter , but I bet next year it will be great .	-1
I like a product that does what it should , first and foremost , price being secondary . I can complain about the price all day but if the product was right I at least have a good product . Cheap price and a product in the trash is worse than an expensive product but one I use.This is made for small children or beginners . the goggles are worthless so they can not be used afterwords . the files and slides are not something my daughters will be able to keep.Essentially it is a kit that teaches them how to make slides but when it is all over , they have learned how to make slide but the slides they made with this kit are in the trash.not even the tweezers are worth keeping when it is all said and done.they are happy to have learned how to make slides , but I would have gladly bought the & # 34 ; expensive & # 34 ; one as they would still have slides and equipment to use in the future .	-1
Wow , this product totally ruined my wall . When I took off the tape it took all of my paint with it . Complete failure to work ! This product not only failed to perform it 's job it also ruined my wall ! DO NOT BUY !	-1
What ticks me off the most is that Scotch advertises it 's ScotchBlue Painter 's Tape as having `` Edge-Lock Paint Line Protector technology , which is designed to keep out paint and produce exceptionally sharp paint lines for a brilliant look . `` Guess what ? Edge-Lock is ONLY on their Advanced line of Painter 's Tapes ! I caught this on Scotch 's commercial last night and it was only shown for a very brief instant so I just compared their regular and advanced tapes . The `` original '' does not have Edge-Lock . I find that commercial to be very misleading and had previously bought 5 rolls of ScotchBlue Painter 's Tape expecting great performance . It did n't . The tape does not go on easily and it does n't prevent paint from getting underneath ! Now I 'm stuck with 5 rolls of tape that I ca n't really use.If you must buy ScotchBlue Painter 's Tape then buy the Advanced version . Me , I 'm buying Frog Tape instead , it seems to do a much better job .	-1
I am dissapointed and very surprised to say that this toy has not captured my boys interest at all . I 've had it for a year , and the boys are now 2 1/2 and 3 1/2 . I thought it would be a huge hit , but it has just sat gathering dust . It is very sturdy and has great eye appeal like all Little Tikes toys . My personal complaint is that I think it is VERY noisy-perhaps this is what makes it so unappealing to my children . My kids have loved push toys of all kinds ( even a doll stroller ! ) , but this mower has been a total flop in our household . ( I had first tried the FP Bubble Mower-way to messy and very poor bubble output/ quickly returned . ) At least I 'll get a decent price for it 's like new condition at a yard sale or as a donation . I 'd suggest giving the mower a good trial run in the store and make your own opinion of the noise it makes before purchasing it . Recently while shopping at [ a local store ] my child was inseparable with a [ less expensive ] plastic mower-go figure ! !	-1
I just bought this toy today and I 'm returning it tomorrow . It is the cheapest-made toy I 've ever encountered . As soon as I took it out of the box , I could tell right away I would end up regretting this purchase . The one I got came with a dust-buster , which is even worse than the vacuum . Yes , it makes a loud noise and the front lights up , but it scratches the wood floors and is difficult to push across carpet . The front panel has already fallen off , and the panel in front of the `` filter '' wo n't stay on . My son loves it , but for the money ( $ 30 ! ! ) , there has got to be a better made toy vacuum . One last thing ... .they should NOT advertise that it really works . I was n't looking for a vacuum that sucks up dirt , but the box says it does , and it does n't even come close . Unfortunately , at the store , there were n't any other real-looking vacuums to choose from . Does anyone know where I can get a good quality , fun vacuum ? ?	-1
My son is so obsessed with or vacuum , so I got this hoping he would be able to hold it and push it around , since ours is to heavy . the noises are silly and it 's cheap and not realistic , bummed I bought it and paid $ 12 shipping !	-1
It 's fine for a basketball but what I was looking for was one that would be useful on a dirt driveway . The ball is fine but the description was not really accurate . This would be fine on a hard surface court but not good for the above the garage door type court .	-1
This is NOT a toy , and it 's very real ! The `` ghosts '' you think you 're talking to , are nothing but demons from the pits of Hell who are trying to mislead you.Parents.PLEASE educate your children with the truth about these things.Read Deuteronomy 18:10-13 in The Bible.I 'm speaking the truth as a Christian.That is why I probally will catch alot of heat for writing this review.If I had been a Muslim , I would be overlooked.That 's lovely religious `` tolerance '' for ya .	-1
On the plus side of this game it requires no batteries , has no parts , requires no reading but that is the only this I can say about it that I like.In fact I do n't think I would call it a game , It is more like a crocodile toy that snaps shut on your hands when you push the wrong tooth down . I only paid 11 bucks for it and that was too much.I have 5 children under the age of 5 at my day care and a 10 and 12 year old child and let me tell you there is a lot better games out there . Candy Land , Connect four , Dot the Dog , and Fisher price has some preschool games out that are much better than this.Would be an ok addition to a dental program at a preschool or if you just like spending money .	-1
I bought this for my 4 y/o triplets . First , I am shocked this is for ages 4 and up . I think it would be more fun for younger childen . Although my kids liked it the first few times they played it ... .they quickly moved on to another toy.Second , I ca n't believe this toy had a seal on it , for some type of `` best toy '' award . What is the value in this `` game ? '' You press a tooth , the next player presses a tooth , etc , until it chomps on your hand . Okay , so it 's cute , thrilling for a bit ... but it gets boring fast ! I 'm not kidding when I say the game is over in less than a minute.For my kids who love games , this is just so different . They do n't need to `` think '' about their next move , it 's just pure chance that you 'll get the wrong tooth . I 'm not one saying that all games/toys need be educational ... some should be just pure fun ... but this one just is n't . The thrill was over the first few times of play.I 'm boxing it up and returning it in it 's original packing for something more challenging . We LOVE games here , but this is a huge disappointment .	-1
This game scared my 2 year old and my 4 year old was n't thrilled with it either . I do n't think it 's worth the money at all , it 's a game that does n't have much to it and if it does n't scare the kid they will be bored with it quickly . ( ... ) I do not suggest paying full price for it at all .	-1
My 3-year-old son desperately wanted this game , and while I wanted to get him something more educational ( where you actually learned something ) I gave in and we got this toy . I wish I had n't . He played with it for about 20 minutes , and it 's seen only the dust in the toybox ever since . The teeth will stick down and not reset , there 's really not much fun about this toy , unless you like getting your hand snapped between two 'gator lips !	-1
This game is fun a few times , and then gets put back in the box never to be looked at again . It takes no skill and is over in 30 seconds . Maybe it is the age of my son , he got this for his 5th birthday , but I would save the money and buy a game with more thinking and that will be enjoyed more than a few times , like Clue Jr. or Monopoly Jr. Or if you are looking for a more simple game like this one that will hold more attention , Whac-A-Mole is better or even Elefun ( I think the new one is a flying fish version ) . Hullabaloo is also a great game , even for only one child to play . I am glad my son got this as a gift and we did n't waste our own money on it !	-1
I made the mistake of buying this 2 years ago for my then 1 year old . The first thing that happened -it tipped over bonking her on the head . Then after many times of leaning on it , tipping over all the time ... .. the top broke off from the tower ( only 1 month after I bought it mind you ) and it became a deadly weapon-the tower had sharp tabs on top of it . The round handle piece that goes over the top of the tower ( weighs quite a bit ) became a heavy duty frisbee between my then 3 year old and her 1 year old sister . I had to swipe it away and toss the thing where it belongs ... ..in the TRASH ! -What a piece of junk-I am rather suprised at Fisher Price and this line of toys-all I have bought from this line was either dangerous or a piece of junk . Better re-think of a better line of toys there Fisher Price . I would NOT RECOMMEND this toy for anyone . Read about my other reviews from this line of Fisher Price Toys ... they are just the same and I recommend you read them before you make the same mistake I made in buying them .	-1
We bought this for our daughter 's first birthday . At first she did n't play to much with it and it is just recently ( at 16 months ) that she really seems to have gotten & quot ; into & quot ; this toy . She spends a lot of time each day pushing the balls down the shoot , pushing the blue smiley button on top that makes music , and in general just hanging all over it . It has been a good buy .	-1
I purchased this for my then 6 month old daughter , but upon further inspection decided that the cruise and crawl playground would be more appropriate . It seems more sturdy and has more activities to extend its useful life , and the price difference is not that great .	-1
I bought this toy for my 1 year old and he was not impressed ; neither was I . It is so flimsy ( kept unsnapping ) and it tips over way to easy . He played with it for about 5 minutes and that was it . The only thing he continued to play with was the balls ( throwing them around the house ) . Do n't waste your money , it is very over-priced .	-1
My child liked pushing the button that made the music . That was all it was good for . The beat was fun and happy , but the rest of the toy was a flop . Tipped too easy for early standers . Balls all over the house . Never could find a ball when you needed one . Other items got stuffed in it and stuck . Do n't waste your money .	-1
this is a ok item , my son played with is a few times , but ut has tipped over on him when he was first learning how to walk , but other than that it is great	-1
I bought this and it was very difficult to put together . Not well made at all . I finally gave up after an hour or two of trying to line up the track and pop it in place with out it all falling apart on me . I returned it . ( I couldnt even dismantle it again to return it .	-1
I usually like Fisher Price toys , but this one has missed the mark . The toy comes apart very easily and my kiddos lost interest in it pretty quickly . The balls are very easy to lose as well . There are better toys out there that serve the same purpose .	-1
I bought this toy to try to encourage my daughter to stand up . She never crawled so I thought it wise to get something that would encourage her to stand from a sitting positon so she could finally be mobile . This was a terrible choice . It is not sturdy enough for children to pull up on it . My daughter , who is tiny for her age ( now 19 lbs . at 1 ) , topples the toy . She does n't enjoy putting the balls on the track and could care less about the music and lights . She does however , love the balls . I now keep the balls in an old wipes container that I cut the lid off of and the rest of this is in the corner of her bedroom . It only gets used when my nieces are over ( they 're 3 and 6 ) . They find this toy engaging for about 5 minutes . It takes me longer to dust the thing off when they want to use it . I 'll be putting it away soon and keeping the balls out . This toy might ne good for you if you 're looking to entertain your lil one for a few but it wo n't help them stand at all .	-1
My 9 month old daughter received this as a gift about a month ago . She played with it for a few minutes at a time and quickly realized what she was supposed to do with the balls . She stood up , put a ball in the top , pushed it through , watched it come out , and then looked at me like , `` Now what ? '' My daughter is content to play with books , so it 's not like she has to have a high level of entertainment to keep her interested in something . I 've continued to play with her some , but she quickly loses interest in this toy and crawls away . I find the music to be loud and annoying , too . The balls always come out one of two holes ( we even tried to adjust the level to make them come out more evenly ) , but no luck . Although it 's colorful and LOOKS like it would be a lot of fun , it is a real disappointment , especially after reading the glowing online reviews . This toy is going in the back of the closet for a few months ... if not forever ! There are better toys out there for your money , and I am glad I did not waste our own money on this one .	-1
I saw a review on here that said the balls only popped out ONE hole . Well I thought I 'd take the chance and buy it for my daughter for Christmas . It was a little work to put together but not much . Took me maybe half an hour or less . I did n't find it hard once I knew how to put it together . However , once putting it together , I discovered mine as well only pops out one hole . Two popped out a different hole but only when my brother had tilted it when he went to move it . I think it 's cute that the ball spins on top however , it does n't fall through the holes in order to get to the track to roll down to the bottom . My daughter is almost 9 months old and never tipped it even the slightest bit.However , I am highly disapointed in this product for mine does n't do what it 's supposed to , coming out the same hole is NOT interesting at all . So I 'll sadly be returning it for a refund . Paid 35CA for it , not worth it at all . The other toy like this product , the saucer ( not sure the name ) is great though.I hope whoever buys this does n't have the same problem I did . I hope it works perfectly for your child as I wish it did for mine !	-1
I took the pool out of the box , saw all the work needed to pump it up , put it back in the box , and returned it . Honestly , I could n't figure out how to pinch the air holes . I had to pinch them to get air in with the pump . Maybe I did n't have the right tools . Who knows . But I ended up buying a snap pool which holds practically the same amount of water . No pumping , no deflating .	-1
I am confused about the good reviews . Maybe our track is the only one with issues . The cars that came with it NEVER make it past the second turn . They either just stop or the top of the car gets stuck on the turn above . Anyhow it is a total disappointment . I should have kept the packaging to return it as it is now just taking up space . Do n't waste your money .	-1
We bought this for our 2 1/2 year old for Christmas . He played with it a few times the first couple of weeks but has not touched it since.It does not seem as sturdy as our other Fisher-Price toys , although it has not broken , probably because it is not getting any use.He really loves the FisherPrice figure-8 , motorized track - although it got so-so reviews , ours has worked perfectly and he uses it all the time .	-1
What a boring toy.Here you have a sturdy dual twisting set of ramps . The slightest touch sets off an irritating electronic noise ( presumably of race cars whizzing past ) that you can not turn off ( Fisher-Price seems to have a thing against on-off switches on its toys ) .Placing two plastic race cars at the top of the ramps and starting them sends them spiraling downward at a rapid pace with the said noise reverberating around your eardrums . If your child is playing with this on a carpet , the cars roll ahead about 4 inches ; if he/she is playing on a hard floor , they roll a whopping 8 inches forward . If you are not careful , the lightweight cars will end up underneath the sofa or TV stand , making them impossible to find again.Does n't this sound exciting ? I tried very hard to get my son interested in this playset . I set up the cars , `` revved '' the engines , and asked him to race my car.He ignored me and continued playing with his Mega Blocks.On the rare times he paid attention to this dud , he would try and race his Matchbox and Hot Wheels cars down the ramps , but they were too large . Only the two cars that come with this set work.Most of the time , this toy sits in his playroom unused . It is marked for the garage sale pile this spring .	-1
This was a must have on the wish list for xmas last year . After we got it and the kids played with it a couple times , it was just kinda boring . You just launch the cars and they roll down the ramp . Not sure why we or the kids thought it would be more interesting . Just one of those toys that is n't worth the money . Maybe for a very young child 's first kind of race track toy .	-1
This toy was more trouble than it was worth trying to play with . My son and I spent more time unsticking the cars and various parts of the toy that we gave up and eventually kicked it to the curb ... ... ..	-1
Ok ... .This thing has a cool look to it , but that 's about all . It 's not too sturdy . It 's not all that much fun to play with . My two year old son got bored within a half an hour and my three year old nephew continued to play with it , but he constantly knocked off the plastic suports at the top after he sent every car down the ramp and wanted me to fix it . ( which I did for about twenty minutes ) You 're better off buying the hotwheels track set and setting up a ramp from the top of the bureau and have a jump over styrofoam cups .	-1
We got this for my almost 4 year old who is truly not overly rough on his toys . My husband put it together , and both he and my son had difficulty operating the thing ( particularly the `` elevator '' on one side , which was VERY stiff ) and the pieces easily come apart . This is very frustrating for a little kid , as well as the parent who has to constantly put it back together . Even my son said he did n't like it ! ( ... ) ! Fortunately we still had the box , and I was able to return it to the store .	-1
I saw a demo of this at a local toy store sometime after my kids pointed this out the TV commercial . It looked even worse than the commercial and there are too many moving parts for this to work reliably . From my vantage point , even the commercial seems to barely show the thing working ... If you want good Hot Wheels toys , you should stick with the basic building sets ( like the Hot Wheels Starter Kit ) as they do n't employ all of the special effects gizmos that cause the toys to be too hard to use .	-1
My son got this a year ago and tore into it like a madman . Once he did everything there was to do , he grew bored with it and just talked on the phone . The bench itself turned out to be my sons favorite stepstool .	-1
I did n't follow their recommendation that this is n't for kids under three , and I purchased this for my 18 month old daughter . She liked it , but quickly outgrew it . Plus it toppled over easily when she would bounce on it . Do n't used it around any other furniture because they will fall off it several times . It 's just not stable . I do not see how a 3 year old would ever fit on this . It 's very overpriced in my opinion . I sold it at a yard sale for half what I paid for it after only 4 months .	-1
When not pump up enough air it tend to sag real fast unstable on a car ; et floor No grip so the child can fall quite easily .	-1
This toy has so many positive reviews , but my son thinks it is okay . Rody is not very steady . Because of the ball feet , Rody falls over very easily . This makes it hard for my son to bounce on it . There are better toys out there for the money .	-1
This is probably the biggest disappointment from Christmas presents this year . I had such high hopes for this toy and it has let me down . It 's cute , but that 's where the positives end . To start , it 's ridiculously hard to inflate fully . Every time we get it blown up , it looses so much air when we pull out the valve to inflate to insert the plug . Very frustrating . It is very unstable to bounce on . I figured there would be some sort of adjustment period where my son would have to figure out how to balance , but my 4 year old daughter was struggling with this and she does great on those bouncing ball things . The kids always seem to topple over on the horse or fall off the back . Cute idea ... very poorly executed . I am surprised there were so many good reviews because I ca n't see how kids can bounce on this toy for more than a few seconds before falling off .	-1
So sorry I purchased this hopper . The product is bright and seems durable , but the design is very unstable , causing dangerous tumbling over the top of the horse when hopping . Will not allow our little one to use for anything but sitting due to risk of head , neck or facial injuries . Would not recommend .	-1
A friend of mine has one of these and her kids love it ! So I ordered one and it has a very strong chemical odor that wo n't go away and it does n't inflate all the way ( the legs , tail and ears do n't fill up completely ) . The company and Amazon have great customer service but the product is flawed .	-1
I bought this toy for my 8-month-old daughter . Right away we discovered the most rediculous feature imaginable in a toy : namely , that in & quot ; music & quot ; mode , when the child pushes one of the letters that plays a new song , the child then naturally wants to spin the ball -- but doing so makes the song stop ! The toy then reverts to one of 2 intensely boring melodies . For a child as young as mine who can spin the ball well but has difficulty pressing the letters , the toy only plays a couple of dull songs -- not much incentive to play with the toy . For a somewhat older child who CAN press the letters , there is a different tune for each letter -- but the tune stops as soon as you spin the ball ! So , the child is punished for spinning the ball ! I HATE this toy . In order for my daughter to hear a song , I have to prevent her from spinning the ball , and hold it still . More like punishment than fun . She has entirely stopped wanting to play with this toy .	-1
The Discovery Ball toy is the perfect example of why reviews can be misleading to shoppers . Parents read the reviews , the particulars , and they think , & quot ; WOW , this toy is developmental , it will teach my kid the alphabet , and letter sounds . My kid 'll be a genius by 2 ! & quot ; To be honest , had I reviewed this toy soon after my son received it , I would have given it 5-stars and gushed about its developmental qualities . However , time has proven reliable , and I have deduced after 2-years and 2-months that it is , and was insignificant to my son 's development . By that , I mean the toy was of no consequence to us.The concept is first-rate , however the delivery is lacking . I mean , what kid wants to roll a ball when they can throw it ? The Discovery Ball is designed for infants and toddlers , but it 's probably more appropriate for preschoolers . Firstly , the buttons are too difficult for an infant to press ; also , they are too close together . Secondly , it 's too sensitive . For example , let 's say the toy is in & quot ; music & quot ; mode and its playing Old MacDonald , if the ball is touched midstream the music will stop , and revert into 1 of the 2 very annoying intervening songs . It 's like punishment , rather than play . Can I say without it sounding too harsh , & quot ; WHAT 'S THE POINT ? & quot ; LeapFrog should have decided long ago whether they were designing an educational tool for preschoolers , or a plaything for infants.William received the Discovery Ball for his 1st Christmas . He was 8-months old at the time , so I took the ball off the stand so he could bat it around on the floor . He 'd roll it , the lights would flash , the music would play , and he 'd giggle . After a few rolls , he lost interest . The toy has a musical prompt , which occasionally got a look , but most often , he was onto something better . Soon after his 1st birthday , he discovered the ON/OFF switch . He 'd sit on the floor and repeatedly turn the thing & quot ; ON & quot ; and then & quot ; OFF & quot ; . It would play the ABC Song for 3-seconds , he 'd slide the lever to the & quot ; OFF & quot ; position , and then back to & quot ; ON & quot ; again . It was enough to drive me nuts ! He did n't care about the phonics , or even the music , all he cared about was that darn ON/OFF switch . The sound quality is good , but the woman 's voice grated on my nerves after hearing 3-seconds of the ABC Song 1000-times in an afternoon . Fortunately , there is a volume control , although my son usually wants to HEAR his toys . As if the lower level is n't loud enough . UGH ! Oh , and this toy is one of those irritating playthings that goes off in the toy box , if you fail to turn it & quot ; OFF & quot ; .After his 2nd birthday , William gained enough strength and proficiency to throw the ball . I suppose I should have attached it to its base right there and then , but dummy me thought he 'd grow out of that phase . Later , I realized the throwing phase was here to stay , so I put the Discovery Ball back on its base . My attempts were futile , as my crafty little one figured out how to remove it a week later . The toy is sturdy , especially considering how many times it has been dropped , and thrown . We 've only replaced the batteries twice , which is an event all its own . Let me just say , its not overly difficult , but more complicated than most.The Discovery Ball can be tricky to wash. LeapFrog recommends you clean the ball with a damp cloth , but that does n't always produce the best results . You see , the letters and musical notes that cover the surface of the ball are raised , so grime can become lodged in , and between the grooves . I 've resorted to spraying Lysol on a rag and wiping it down . It does n't completely remove the dirt , but it disinfects it , which makes me feel better.In conclusion , the toys more annoying than enjoyable , so it collects dust , until my son finds it , and then it 's transformed into a heavy , throwing ball that hurts when hit . My advice ~ avoid it.Mary : )	-1
The overall product and idea are great , but the most educational part of the toy needs work . When baby moves the ball , it starts the alphabet and goes to a certain point . Unless it is moved again in a very short period of time , it will start at the beginning again , hence , baby/toddler and parents get tired of `` ABCD '' and `` ABCD '' and `` ABCD . '' My son would never know the latter part of the alphabet if we relied soley on this to teach him . Also , the 26 different songs it claims to play are really just different organizations of the same computer tones , with the exception of a few well knowns like Mary Had a Little Lamb and B-I-N-G-O . Finally , when pressing the letters to hear the sounds they make , you have to move the ball and so 80 % of the time you 'll get the start of the alphabet again before you get the sound of the letter you have chosen to hear - it 's just confusing and needs a little work !	-1
While the toy is & quot ; Educational & quot ; sings alphabet , and plays soft but catchy music not to annoying for parents , the base after time doesnt keep the ball secure.The ball is heavy , and will come apart after a fair amount of play . When your child learns to THROW , you will want to hide this . Its heavy and it hurts when it hits you.When the ball seperates as if you were changing batteries and it will , the plastic edges are a tad but sharp.I do not recommend this toy .	-1
I debated on whether to get my 3 year old the My First or the original Leap Pad . I went with the My First , but when I received it , I realized that my daughter was way too advanced for most of the material . I really think this is more meant for age 2-3 . It is things like , counting from 1-10 , learning body parts , colors and shapes . These are things my daughter knew by the age of 3 . There are some good things for her age , but I learned that the original leap start has the red books called pre-math , pre-reading and etc . These books are the same level as the My First , so there really is no need to even buy the My First in my opinion . I gave the My First to my 20 month old to play with and bought my three year old the original as I should have done in the first place .	-1
This LeapPad system is very frustrating . My daughter got this for Christmas and played with it once or twice , and then got disgusted with it , and so did I.The biggest problem I had is that half the pages of the book that came with it do n't work correctly . I touch the green go circle and it either starts telling the story on another page , or just makes a funny sound and does nothing . Or , even if it does read the info off the correct page , sometimes if I touch one thing , it will say it 's another , like on the page with the parts of the body , I would touch the mouth and it would keep saying nose ! I know I 'm doing everything correctly because my son has the big LeapPad , which is the same principal . I should have just let my daughter play with his LeapPad and saved some money .	-1
My mother-in-law got this for my daughter when she was either 2 or 3 years old . Sadly , this was one of the only Leapfrog toy that was not a hit . She played with it only a little bit . It did not hold her attention at all . In order to use it , we have to insert the cartridge that goes with the book into the machine . That necessitates keeping track of the cartridges and books and then lugging everything and the machine with us . Tag is much better . Everything is loaded onto the pen and all we need is the book . Besides , the stories on Tag are much more interesting and there are more activities .	-1
MY HUSBAND AND I BOUGHT THIS FOR OUR 2 1/2 YEAR OLD FOR CHRISTMAS.IT IS HARD FOR HER TO USE.WE HAVE TRIED AND TRIED , WORKING WITH HER , BUT THE CONCEPT OF THE PEN AND THE BOOK DOES NOT STAY ON LEAPPAD , IT SLIPS OFF FLIPS OVER.I WENT OUT AND PURCHASED THE POWERTOUCH BY FISHER PRICE , SHE COULD USE IT THE FIRST TIME SHE TRIED IT.NO PEN JUST YOUR FINGER AND THE BOOK STAYS IN PLACE.IT IS A SHAME THAT THE LEAP FROG DID NOT WORK , NOW I HAVE IT AND 6 BOOKS AND TAPES , JUST TOO MUCH TO KEEP THE BOOK STILL AND USE THE PEN .	-1
This toy is fun for a five year old , but it does n't get any younger . You two to four year old has to press a small green `` Go '' circle for every single two-sided page , then makes a musical sound letting you know the new page is on . By the time the music ends your toddler will turn the page again . A small toddler wants to look at the pictures and enjoy the story without having to `` look for the circle '' or `` find Edison '' . Your child does not even know who Edison is yet . It looks like a lot of fun to an adult , but it is more of a gift to please the adult then it is to teach the child.If what you are looking for is an educational toy for a 2-4 year old , I recomend Fisher-Price : Learn Through Music . It is PERFECT for that age group . It only has four buttons and a touch screen . The pages are behind a see-through case and a finger touch is always acurate ( as My First Leap Pad is not always acurate to what is being touched ) .Please wait till your child is use to specific instructions on taking tests before you give them My First Leap Pad . By then they are ready for the regular Leap Pad . Instead , purchase LEARN THROUGH MUSIC . I has the same concept of My First Leap Pad , but is gentler to little hands .	-1
I am overall a HUGE leapfrog fan ! I love the educational value of their toys and systems.We received ours a few years ago and it has never been a big hit beyond the first week.The catridges often gave errors , the books never seemed to stay in well . and the kids often ended up frustrated within a few minutes . and my kids outgrew it very fast , it has a short lige span in childrens ages In my opinion . We recently recieved Fisher prices power touch and it is more age versitile and the kids are not frustrated with it at all : ) .	-1
My two year old son was very excited when I bought him the desk , but he quickly lost interest . He had to use the awkward pen to touch the green go circle on each page and sometimes the pen did n't work correctly . We tried replacing the batteries , but to no avail.We bought the Fisher-Price PowerTouch . It is much better . Not only will it last longer because of the expanded age range , but it came with 2 books , instead of 1 . It is much easier to hold and operate . I highly recommend you spring for the PowerTouch . The extra $ 10 more than pays for the 2nd book alone .	-1
This is not the best of the Leap Frog brand . This toy is just ok . Nothing exciting - I have two boys , each barely looked at this frog twice .	-1
My daughter never looked twice at Baby Tad : ( I was really disappointed ! The music is nice , but not very catchy for an older infant/toddler . The bottons are not the easiest for a younger infant to press either . Anyhow , I am sure this would be a great toy , just not anything my daugher liked . Our Baby Tad ended up being sold at a yard sale for 5 bucks : )	-1
Got this for baby when she was 5 months and she could n't figure anything out . She 's now 9 months and stll has n't figured it out . She does n't know that pressing the lights will play more music , let alone pressing the palms , feet , or the lipstick mark on the cheek.BTW - the volume control switch is on the face of the battery compartment . The settings are either REALLY low or REALLY high !	-1
I bought this for my daughter when she was 6 months old , but she was too little to activate it . At 18 months , she still had no interest in it . She loves music , but this never caught her attention . I finally got rid of it recently since we do n't have room for toys that she does n't play with . I highly recommend Leapfrog 's Dreamscape crib soother instead . I could activate when she was small and now she does it herself .	-1
I received this toy FREE , thank God , from Leapfrog due to a minor injury caused by one of their other toys.My son never liked this toy , but that is not why I am not rating it well . The buttons are n't easy enough for many babies to press , and as I mentioned in another review ... If a child is going to learn colors and shapes , they need to be learned separately because confusion is created . Could you imagine being a small baby and having some toy tell you that the same exact object was `` purple '' and `` circle '' ? On the other hand , if all of the shapes were the same color , they would differentiate and recognize that each object is different not by color , but by shape . And vice versa.Another issue is the night-time song . I do n't know what parent would want their child in the dark with flashing lights and a loud song to try to get them to sleep . ? ? ? ? ? ? I am just so disappointed in the toy industry . I am a young stay-at-home mom , and the toys that were around when I was little were very thought provoking . These days , the toys do all of the thinking for our children .	-1
Got this as a gift , and took it back rather quickly . Something about his voice and what it did just was too wierd . I 've seen similar toys , maybe next baby we will try those . But this just was n't our style . We exchanged it for something much cooler !	-1
The buttons on baby tad 's chest are hard to press , his morning button ( on the left palm ) already broke ( has a short in it already after 1 - yes 1 day of playing ) , it only plays up to 6 minutes of nite nite songs ( ever tried getting your baby to sleep in 6 minutes ? ) , you have to keep pressing buttons to keep it from say `` bye bye '' and turning off . She liked it for about 10 minutes . It 's not a very good buy . I love leapfrog products but this one failed consumers .	-1
I love leapfrog toys and we have purchased several different things for our son and for others as gifts . Since our 10 month old loves to bang everything he can get his hands on , we thought he would love this . But , we 've had it for a few months and so far he has shown little interest in it . Also , even the `` quiet '' music setting is pretty loud .	-1
Yes this toy does shut off too quick . I do n't think that it is too loud though . But there really is nothing great about it at all !	-1
I first saw this toy online and then went to BRU to check it out with my 6 month old daughter . She seemed interested but I was hesitant because the toy seemed annoying . I didnt really want to spend 19.99 on a toy I couldnt stand to let her play with . Well I found it secondhand yesterday for less than $ 5 so I thought why not.This toy has got to be the most annoying toy Ive come accross ! ! ! ! ! There are two volumes LOUD and EXTREMELY LOUD ! Why a toy company would make a toy so loud that a child will be playing with that is a foot away from their ears is beyond me.This teaches ABC , 123 and a kind of simon says . The music that it plays along with these teaching sessions are short tunes that are looped over and over for our enjoyment.My daughter is into whacking things right now so that is why I bought this for her . She gets enjoyment from whacking the drum and seeing the lights and hearing the sounds.I hate this toy , its louder than it needs to be and it doesnt have enough variety in music . Im glad I didnt spend the $ 20 on it .	-1
We bought this last Christmas for our 6 month old . She played with it that day and has n't looked at it since . Our 4 year old however loves it . I consider this to be a waste of money - I 'll be lucky if I get $ 2 for it at a garage sale . ( I did find that our daughter liked the traditional drum better ! )	-1
My son recieved this toy for this past xmas . Because we have sooo many toys we waited to bring it out . This toy has been sitting w/ all the other toys in the livingroom and my son has only bothered w/ it maybe 3 times . And that is only usually when my 3 yr old daughter is playing w/ it . This toy seems like a better toy for slightly older kids who have started to learn how to count , and say their abc 's . It 's just not intresting to my son at all .	-1
My daughter got this toy when she was 14 months old . I ca n't figure out why she gets bored with it so easily . She wo n't pay attention to this toy for more than one minute . It 's great in concept , but did n't work for us . My daughter is now 2 years old , and whenever I get this toy out , it still does not capture her attention .	-1
From our point of view , the other reviewer is correct , alot of small children will learn nothing from this drum because to learn something you have to pause long enough for the drum to 'say something complete ' . Certainly my little boy would n't stop whacking it . ( I was afraid he would learn to stutter from the frequent repeats-lol ) .And I know it 's supposed to have won awards , but my two children ( girl and then boy ) just did n't get it . My daughter , for example , just did n't like the noise , even at the quieter setting.And my son ... well , when he was old enough to sit up and play with this toy , he would n't stop making it repeat the first few syllables , over and over . And later , when he was older ( 15 - 24 months ) he found it boring , having moved on from any stationary playing position . He was action-guy , and far more into Thomas , mega-legos and watching the Leapfrog videos than he was into sitting with a drum to learn his alphabet.Two Stars for us . It just did n't work as an educational toy at our house . During the timeframe in which it would and could have been educational the children were too young to absorb the information ; and by the time they were ready , sitting down was the last thing on their agenda . **Note : For alphabet learning , we highly recommend Leapfrogs videos .	-1
My daughter was thrilled to receive this gift . She immediately went upstairs to fix her sick stuffed animals and her brothers.However , within 10 minutes of playing with this doctors kit the case top fell apart . The stethoscope does not fit my petite daughters ears and the heart monitor did not work . The head mirror does not fit on her head or even around her one year old baby brothers head . The blood pressure monitor does not stay together.We will be returning .	-1
Opened the box it was shipped in , pulled it out , took the plastic off , gave it to my 3 yr old son and he opened it and the handles broke off . If you look close at the picture ... you 'll see that the handles only open part way so a child ... any child does n't have the delicate touch to only pull open so far . Also , the stethoscope was REALLY hard to hear .	-1
The box for these toys does n't close well , the toys do n't fit back inside the box and the closure on the top of the box broke after about two hours of normal play . We returned this and bought the classic Fisher Price version .	-1
The blocks are REALLY small and not worth the ~ $ 20.00 I paid for them . They are nothing special , just beads in a colored block . They might be great for a 6-8 month old baby , but my three year old wont even give them a glance when I pull them out of the toy chest .	-1
im 5'4 '' and 120 lbs and it is too small for me . Looks cute and seems to be made good .	-1
Mine was missing the creamer and the company no longer makes them so they could n't provide a replacement . Otherwise it is a good product . The cups change color in my daughters room and it is n't overly hot/cold ... not sure what that is about !	-1
I bought the Giggle Ball for my son when he was 7 months old . He loved the bead toys at the doctor 's office , so I thought this toy might be a hit . Wrong ... my son had no interest in playing with it , despite my repeated attempts . I have a few guesses why the toy was such a flop : -It 's a bit heavy and bulky for a little one to hold onto.-The beads are n't the easiest to move around the wires , because theres not much space to move your hand around the toy.-It 's very difficult to get the toy to `` giggle '' , and when you do succeed , you can barely hear the sound it makes ( not a giggle ) .Do n't waste your money on this one .	-1
My son has not liked this product since the day I bought it.It seems pretty pointless and does nothing to keep his attention.It has n't been touched in months .	-1
I just bought this mobile tonight because I was in the store shopping and seen it for 6 dollars . ( on clearance ) Well , I am so glad I did n't pay full price because it 's not worth ... dollars at all . First of all the music is way too loud , I do n't know what people r saying that theirs is too low but this one is so loud . Second of all the remote control is useless , u might as well just walk over to the crib to use it . So I am gon na be returning it even though I got it so cheap . I would not recommend this mobile at all . DONT WASTE YOUR MONEY ! !	-1
It was a mistake buying the Nerf Rapid Fire 20 . The air tank is not big enough to shoot 20 darts . Also , it is hard to pump it . I DID NOT BREAK THE AIR TANK . It kind of works ... I should 've just stick to my magstrike WHICH IS A LOT BETTER because it is easy to pump and it can shoot all 10 darts without running out of air.http : //www.amazon.com/Nerf-N % 252dStrike-Magstrike-AS % 252d10/dp/B001Q4BWPQ/ref=sr_1_2 ? ie=UTF8 & qid ; =1289942156 & sr ; =8-2	-1
I generally do a lot of research into the product reviews before confirming to purchase them . I chose these for the novelty concept and was very disappointed . They fell apart the time my son used them and seemed to be merely a cheap set of binoculars with a small green light on it . You get what you pay for in this case . Consider spending the extra money if you are looking for quality .	-1
This toy did not come with batteries . I got this for Christmas and my son upon opening it had to put it aside because it did n't have batteries in it.It is n0t a night scope . Without the red light , it is just like looking through a 99cent binocular toy.It would have been cheaper to go to the 99 cent store , get a binocular toy and a flashlight coz thats what it is .	-1
I realize these would not be very realistic , but they did not last through Christmas day . The lens broke and then were thrown awayA waste of money	-1
It broke as I was untwisting it from the ball shape in which it arrives . It was literally out of the package for less than a minute . Nothing like the quality of the original .	-1
Will only keep you play for 15 ' and that was it because there is not that many options . After that , there is nothing to do .	-1
I had seen this toy on tv and my son ( 5 years ) wanted it so we bought it for Christmas . It is so annoying ! The music on the school bus is so loud and there is no on/off switch . When we put it up and something bumps it , it goes off with the music . I finally just took the batteries off . My son played with it a little and now he is tired of it . I would save your money and buy a better game .	-1
The 4 new globes came defective and all needed replacement batteries . One globe worked for almost 30 days ... when we went to return it to Amazon we were charged a 20 % restocking fee . These globes are very good if they work ! Leap Frog has stopped making them and I wonder why ? I would look at the Oregon Scientific model even for a child ... This globe is a waist of $ based on quality .	-1
My 12 month old daughter received this for her birthday . I was initally thrilled with the welcomed new classical tunes ( all of which are very pleasant to listen to ) . The toy has two modes , one that plays the whole song ( s ) and one that plays part of it and stops until the baby moves the toy again to get it going . THis mode also will make sounds if the toy is not jiggled within a minute or so . Sadly , I was disapointed in this toy because it does n't automatically shut off which I thought was very silly . Thus the toy will remind you that it 's still on FOREVER ! ! So it does n't make a nice crib toy becasue she ca n't turn it on or off by herself ( you have to flip a hidden switch to get it on and off ) and will play all night if you let it . Finally , my daughter was n't particularly interested in the toy anyway . Thus I had to give low stars on fun & education since she was n't drawn to it to play or learn , though the music IS very nice . As for durability , the thing is like new since she does n't touch it . Did n't do it for us .	-1
I was going to write a review chastising myself for having been stupid enough to have overpaid for their Sunshine Symphony . Since then , I see Amazon has dropped the list price to $ 35 , and has discounted it further , down to a sale price of $ 9.98.I have noticed other Neurosmith products with similarly high product mark-ups , and wish I could be a shareholder of a company that is so adept at exploiting the pocketbooks of new parents . While trying to research some of their other overpriced toys , and those toys ' declining price histories , I found the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission has recalled a Neurosmith toy ( the Pet Me Platypus ) , and that the manufacturer is no longer in business.So , Amazon is giving you a 71 % discount ( complete with free shipping ! ) on a toy that is leftover from a manufacturer who no longer exists . Buyer beware .	-1
She 's already broken about a year after purchase . Her eyes just open and close continually when turned on . I tried new batteries so that was n't the problem . The clothes got worn out quickly , so I purchased her some new ones ( not cheap ) that were n't terry and that solved the problem with that . Also , beware that the bottle is very sharp for those who still put things in their mouth , especially toy bottles . But there is a pacifier to use if you must hide the bottle . I wish I had n't wasted my money . Now my daughter wants a baby you just push her tummy to make her talk . I suggest you get one of those instead .	-1
We bought this for our granddaughters 4th birthday . It got great reviews and since she has a 4 month old baby brother , we thought she may like playing with her own 'realistic ' baby . Although Chou Chou is very cute , after batteries were installed , she sounded and acted more like a baby from The Exorcist movie ! The doll made very strange noises which are not at all realistic baby noises , and the eyes , instead of closing slowly while being rocked to sleep , fluttered wildly the entire time . The breathing sounded like a grown man snoring ! This doll is scary ! Her mother suggested taking the doll back and exchanging for another as she said there must be something wrong with it . We watched the online video of Baby Annabell and it definitely sounds more realistic , appears worth an extra $ 5.00 , plus her mouth moves while eating .	-1
This smock works ... but for a small amount of more money I couldve gotten something better and that would cover arms . This goes over the head , ties behind the neck , and under both arms . A child can NOT put this on themselves at all . It 's more like an oversized bib than a paint smock . But , we are making it work until a new is bought .	-1
I purchased this smock for our grandson for Christmas along with art supplies and was very disappointed in the quality for a Crayola product.Our grandson is 4 and not a big for year old and the smock was way to short and wide it also fits awkwardly , not a good design or well made product.Get the Melisa and Doug smock it is more expensive but one that will last .	-1
I guess that I should have assumed this would look cheap and flimsy , just because of the price , but I did n't , and that 's what it is . You 'd be better off purchasing one of those large bibs with sleeves if it 's for a toddler , so I think that 's what I 'll do . Also , an adult 's old t-shirt would make a great thing to throw over a kid 's clothes for painting and provide more coverage . This thing is sleeveless , and just not worth the money .	-1
Why tie straps know ? Better to play without arms simple art I bought the gown , There is a string that connects the front and back.Defective product , take nothing of me is wondering whether or not .	-1
A little more difficult for a 3 yr old to operate than I had anticipated . Perhaps should have waited til 4th birthday .	-1
This toy is a blast but , unfortunately like so many things today , the quality is very poor . We bought this for our 4th of July picnic and it was super fun . WE all enjoyed it from ages 5 to grandparents . It soars and flies wonderfully . However , the string did n't last as long as the picnic and we were left holding a pull-string toy with no more pull-string . Really , how many brains does it take to realize that if you 're manufacturing a toy reliant on a pull-string that the string needs to be strong and durable ? We liked the toy so much we 're going to try to fix the string . But it would have been nice if it was made to work and last in the first place .	-1
Years ago , my now-ten year old had a great helicopter toy from Discovery Toys -- you pulled a string and the propellor blades would go 20 feet or more in the air . I know have a three year old and the ten year old wanted to create the same experience for her little sister . This is not the one to do it . The blades would go about 5 feet tops and it was a little hard to pull . I will continue to search for the dream flying toy !	-1
We bought one of these and played with it for 1 day . I instructed my children to be gentle , and supervised them at all times . After 1 turn ( by me ) , I realised how fragile this toy is . Let 's just say that I am very fussy about being gentle with toys - and I just ca n't see how this toy was ever built to be robust , given the build quality . After 30 minutes of supervised use , the string wo n't retract - and has frayed ( but not yet broken ) . I 'll be staggered if this toy survives a week of gentle use.I almost certainly will be returning this one - given that it was n't cheap , and that it 's about to fall apart . I am certain that a replacement will be just as poor quality .	-1
After 3 minutes the yo-yo just spins in circles and ca n't even perform simple sleeps . It either spins in circles when trying to go down , or stays in sleep for and wo n't come back up . Definitely need to get a better quality yo-yo if you want to do anything with it . At this point I ca n't even yo-yo without tricks and I have n't even used it for more than 5 minutes .	-1
I 've been around yoyos for over 40 years . This one just does n't work right . I bought it for my son , cut it down to his size per the instructions on the package . When he complained that it did n't work I gave it a try . Yoyos are supposed to go down and up . This one only goes down and spins . No matter how hard you try , it just wo n't go back up . I guess if you only want to walk the dog , this might be your yoyo .	-1
YoYo seems out of balance . No matter howmuch care I used in throwing it , it wantedto tilt to one side . Made it difficult tosleep or do tricks . I have a little experiencewith YoYos and have not had this problem withothers .	-1
I spent hours putting these together for my 4-year-old son 's birthday and he 's spent maybe 10 minutes playing with them in the four months since . They looked so cool in the picture , but in reality they take up a lot of space in his room and are n't easy to stack on carpet . There were n't enough of the large red ones to make forts . Perhaps a younger child would get a kick out of these .	-1
This game did not hold my child 's attention at all . In short , the game has a trail-like path winding around a mound of earth . Along the trail are several trap door-like spaces . When a card is drawn , it directs the child to activate the mound , which in turn causes one of the trap doors to fall open . If your figure is on the door and it opens , you lose.Unfortunately , the game is way too simplistic , even for a young child . After about 5 minutes of play , my child was over it . Cute concept , but it needs a lot more functionality/features to be interesting .	-1
This game has all the bells and whistles that are perfect for 6 & 7-year-olds : bunnies , carrots and hot pursuit to the top of the bunny hill ! Unfortunately , the `` holes '' are pretty predictable , and anyone can easily figure out how to avoid them . We played and played the game and not a single person 's bunny was lost . Until we began to TRY to get them sunk.Since the first day we got it , there has been no child-driven interest in playing this game again.I am so glad that I did n't pay for Funny Bunny , I would have felt ripped off .	-1
Basically , this is the game of War with a few minor twists . My four-year-old likes it but rarely chooses it ; my 6-year-old is bored silly in about 5 minutes . The order of the food chain can be memorized by even a small child in about 5 minutes , and after that it is a bit mind-numbing . Rat-a-tat-cat and Sleeping Queens are MUCH more interesting and can hold our attention for game after game .	-1
Got this for my daughter as an extra special gift for her 2nd bday . Its a big plastic piece of junk . Its not that fun . I have no idea how it got so many 5 stars . She went down this little hill and was bored after two rides . She never looked at it again - and this huge thing was hard to miss . We returned it and got her the jump-o-lene which she is crazy about . Save your money .	-1
This is just plain stupid . No fun at all . The quality of the little board is cheap and I regret having paid good money for it . It will be going to the thrift store tomorrow .	-1
I usually like Melissa and Doug products , but with this one I decided to ask for a refund before it was even out of the package . Why ? Because I could feel through the plastic coating that not one , but ALL of the pegs were too small for the holes . The bottom of the package was all that was keeping them from falling out completely ! The only good things about this purchase are faint praise indeed : getting the refund from Amazon was easy ; it qualified an add-on item for free shipping ; and the toddler for whom it was intended is young enough not to know the difference when her ( different ) present is late . I 'm just glad I checked before I gave it to her- she 'd have been disappointed in everything except the hammer- which would have gleefully found its way into contact with big brother 's head . lol	-1
Melissa and Doug 's Deluxe Wooden Pound-a-Peg is a classic toy ; however , this particular item does not live up to Melissa and Doug 's reputedly high standards . While the finish on the hardwood is smooth and even , the pegs fit extremely loosely into the bench portion of the toy.Thus , while this toy was a bit of fun for my seven month old grandson , by the time he reached ten months of age he was no longer interested in hammering . He was able to push the pegs down with little effort and so was not keen on using the pound-a-peg as intended . Instead , he found he could easily remove the pegs which could then be used as chew toys . Further , he took to laying them on the play area of the family room ; the flooring was a bear-themed rug in primary colors and the pegs were nearly undetectable . If the adults in the family were not careful , they risked a slip-and-fall . Additionally , because the pegs were attractive as chewing toys and carried in his mouth , I was concerned that if my grandson fell while holding one by the end , he might `` impale '' himself on the peg.Because this toy is reasonably well made , I gave it two stars instead of one . However , the limited time period in which this toy holds a child 's interest , as were the possible safety concerns , resulted in my decision not to award it any higher a rating . This toy was definitely not up to Melissa and Doug 's reputedly high standards .	-1
I usually rave about Melissa & Doug Toys , but this one is awful ! We took it out of the packaging and some of the pegs fell right to the ground through the holes . The holes were not all the same sizes ( though they are supposed to be ) , nor were the pegs because there were some pegs that would work in certain holes and not others , but there were some holes that none of the pegs fit in without falling through . Some pegs were super tight in certain holes and could n't be pounded properly without lots of force and others were pretty loose and one pound would knock them through . I ended up just pitching it after a while as there was no learning benefit to the toy . It was a gift , so I did n't have a receipt for it . The other reviewrs mentioned problems with the hammer ... We never had any troule with it .	-1
This toy does n't need a hammer at all . The pegs are so loose in the holes they push right through with a toddlers hands . I was hoping it was like the old fashioned Peg Bench where you actually hammered the pegs down and then flipped it over and hammered it again . This is useless .	-1
My son enjoyed playing with this and yes , sucking on the pegs . But my daughter wo n't be because I read that this was recalled in Canada for toxic levels of chemicals . M & D did n't bother to recall it here because the American market is full of suckers who accept lax toy standards . I 'll be replacing it with a toy that is NOT MADE IN CHINA and NOT MADE BY M & D .	-1
My children loved this toy but the sides fell off within a week and paint chips off very easily . I did expect paint to come off since there is friction involved , but not within a few days after we just bought it . I did contact Melissa and Doug company and they said they would look into the quality of the product ( sending a box so I can return it to them , along with others I bought that did the same ) . It may be a bad paint batch but I do think parents need to be aware that the sides fell off easily ( they do snap back on , though you really need glue to keep it workable ) and the paint coming off is not good for young children who might put it in their mouth .	-1
We bought this toy for my 2 year old and it 's completely unusable . I 'm thinking of calling the manufacturer . The holes are too small for the majority of the pegs . Unless you bang the pegs REALLY hard with the hammer , they do not budge . I ca n't even get some of them through the holes and my husband gets them , but he has to hit it very hard with the mallet . My daughter gets frustrated with it since she bangs it with the hammer and it does n't budge .	-1
There is no resistance in the pegs , and usually they fall down and out without needing a hammer . I was hoping the kids could work on pounding the pegs down , rather than trying to keep them in and up long enough to swing the hammer . I 'm going to see if my husband can fix this toy to make it something that does n't frustrate the 2 and 4 year olds using it , and so possibly it will entertain them in a positive way instead .	-1
I bought this toy because it reminded me of one that I loved as a child . I was so disappointed when the glue that holds the legs to the bench gave out after just a few days . I tried to re-glue a few times and gave up when it just kept coming apart . It 's one of those Melissa and Doug fails .	-1
The Classic Toy Pound-a-Peg had resistance.You would pound the peg slowly through to the other side , then flip the toy and pound it back again.This one has no resistance.I called the doug and Melissa 1-800 number on the sideand they have offered to mail a replacement toy .	-1
My daughter received this as a gift for her 1st birthday . She is now almost 16 months old and it has never really interested her . It 's a cute toy - with the 3 removable frogs and the catchy songs and letter buttons to push , but it just does n't interest her . She will fiddle with it for a couple of minutes and then move on to something else . I just do n't think it really does enough or has enough to do on it to hold her attention . I have a son who is 2 & 1/2 and he has never really shown any interest in it either .	-1
It does n't snap closed . After very minimal usage it started sticking and now the jaw only closes when forced down . I used to love this toy , wish it was still well made .	-1
Seems cheaply made and much smaller than expected ( about the size of an adult hand ) . My kids played it for about 2 minutes . A waste of money if you ask me .	-1
Terribly designed ; we could n't even make it through one game before it broke . Save your money and buy something of better quality instead .	-1
the title says it all . My 2.5 yr old son was not that interested in the first place , completely stopped playing with it after 30 minutes . It now sits with a pile of toys collecting dust .	-1
My four-year-old loves playing Go Fish over and over since getting these cards.Unfortunately the cards are pretty thin and she bends them very easily.Plus the cards in the Crazy Eights pack are all directions - there are no actual game cards in the pack so we ca n't play that one at all .	-1
I remember playing with these toys as a child and thought it would be fun for my daughter as well . The reason I gave it a low rating is that it does not make any sounds . I almost thought it was broken and was looking for a battery area when I realized there is no sounds and all the toy does is pop up quietly . I remember the Sesame Street version and each character said a little saying when it popped up and this toy does not do that .	-1
This toy is like one I had as a child which is what made me buy it to begin with . I like toys like this but this particular model is defective . The key that you have to turn to make the middle animal pop up is messed up on these . You ca n't close the lid again until you fiddle with the key and get it in the exact right position . It is tricky and little kids ca n't get the hang of it . This really upsets my daughter so I through this away . It was n't just mine either . I have seen others that do it and read about it on other reviews .	-1
I bought this for my daughter at a consignment shop and thought she would enjoy it . She is 14 months old and not a weak child , but she has a very tough time making the animals pop up . The switches and buttons are hard to activate , like other reviewers have pointed out . I want to like this toy , but I ca n't see how a child of only 9 months would be able to make it work properly . Maybe when she gets even bigger she will have more luck with this . I definitely would not recommend this for a child as young as 9 months though ! !	-1
$ 28.99 The week before XMas ? ! ! ! Crazy ! I found it for $ 13 ( and not even in sale ) at my local Target.I will update my review on the toy itself after XMas and when my son will have gotten some time to play with it .	-1
Our kid likes to play with this , so on the toy front it is great for enjoyment . The issue comes when you look at what it is made from and Playskool 's policy on chemical inclusions on products ( aka if it is n't illegal/banned it is fine and we 'll include it ) They wo n't say it does n't include BPA/phthalates/etc . and imply it likely does . We returned this based on this as we try and keep the little guys exposure to a minimum .	-1
We bought this for our son 's 1st Birthday . He 's quite the energetic guy so this really did little for him . At first he was curious how it worked and then lost all interest quickly after . Not a big loss though as it was cheap .	-1
My daughter LOVES this toy . However the buttons are so diffcult to move that it frustrates her . I dont know of any baby strong enough to push the buttons . It needs to be easier for a baby to use . My daughter is constantly asking me to `` help '' her push the buttons and wants to be able to push them herself .	-1
basic toy that has been around since probably my mother was small . last for maybe a few months till their sick of it and it ends up in the toy pile .	-1
It seems that someone is going around and down-voting all of the negative reviews of this product , no matter how clearly written or factual . If you read through them , though , you will see the same opinions expressed again and again : First , the Amazon price is way too high . You can find this toy in most big box retailers for around $ 12-15.Second , the buttons are very stiff and hard for young toddlers to use.This was our experience too . Our baby liked seeing the animals pop up , and she figured out how each lever or knob or button was supposed to work ; she just was n't strong enough to make it happen . You really have to have some strong fingers to use this toy.Since doing the right thing does n't work , the educational value is nil . Baby can only play with it if we help her push the buttons , which defeats the whole point of exploring and playing .	-1
This seemed to be a hot item on the market when our daughter was born in 2000 . We received 3 and kept 1 . She never was a child who liked to play in her crib and never actually used this toy . When we left the toy mounted in her crib turned off at night , it would rattle when she rolled and would wake her . We tried it on the floor numerous times , but it never interested her in the least . She was much more into the xylophone pianos instead .	-1
My daugther received this for her 1st birthday . I thought it would have been an instant hit considering that she absolutely loves music.This toy does not hold her interest at all . The only thing she seems to do is pull the animals out of their holders and throws them around ( and that is really noisy - especially on our wooden floorboards ! . The music is really pretty - very easy to listen to as a parent but the idea of her taking animals in and out to make different sounds seems a bit difficult for her as she does n't have any interest in doing it at all.My 2.5 year old also shows no interest in this toy.It 's a big of a disappointment and I would n't recommend it . There are loads of other musical toys on the market that I would have bought over this one .	-1
just my opinion ; but i have a hard time finding books to go with my 3yr old daughter 's first leap pad . she loves maurice sendak 's where the wild things are and she loves many of the other books that go with the leap pad that is for 6mo-24mo age range . i think they should have done a bit more research on which stories were associated with which leap pad system . as for the pooh bear game ; i agree ; way too easy here ; this would have been perfect for the leap pad made for younger children , and made a more challenging one for this level . great idea ; just not well put together .	-1
Of all the First LeapPad books to buy , make this the last one on your list . My daughter has NO interest in this one whatsoever ! & # 60 ; br / & # 62 ; & # 60 ; br / & # 62 ; ( I have two friends who have said the same thing . )	-1
My 20 month old put these puzzles together 6 times and has never looked at them again . I liked the idea that the puzzles had two sides , and the awesome quality of the product . It just was n't a good investment for me .	-1
There are multiple shapes part like oval and triangle , instead of also making them multiple colors so that they match the animal color is just poor thinking or cost cutting . I did n't like it . Sorry .	-1
I do n't like writing negative reviews , and I have a lot of Melissa and Doug products that I think are great . But right out of the box the paint was peeling off all the puzzles , and worst of all they had an overpowering , terrible odor that made my head ache . I do n't want my children , or anyone else , inhaling that odor on a regular basis . I love the idea of this toy and would have kept it even with the chipped paint , but I could n't get past how badly it smelled , and returned it . Perhaps the odor might dissipate over time but that 's not very comforting to me . Really disappointing . I will say I have not had this happen with other Melissa and Doug products , maybe this was just a bad batch .	-1
HAD KINF KOOLS FOR YEARS AND YEARS ..ALWAYS VERY ROOMY..THESE WERE SO SMALL AND NOT AS NICELY MADE . THEY TOOK A GREAT RAFT AND RUINED THEM : ( WE 'RE USING THEM BUT NOT AT ALL COMFY LIKE THE OKLD ONES WERE .	-1
Okay , I 'm not your typical homeowner . I do n't have a lick of grass . We bought this for my daughter last year . And it was nice for about two weeks.The sides just wo n't stay up . The wind would knock one side down and it would start draining . The bottom is super flimsy . And we could n't keep up with the slime that started growing on it , even with a shot or two of chlorine bleach thrown in.Then it sprung a teeny leak -- dogs or the sand underneath , I do n't know.It was big enough for me to sit in.This year we bought a small hard plastic pool .	-1
I '' m going to make this very brief ... . You have to actually drill the holes directly into the seat itself ! So what happens when you do n't need the belt anymore ? You have a bike that looks ridiculous with huge holes in the seat ... Not well thought out..	-1
This is a great idea , but poorly executed . This toy just does n't seem to be designed for a one year old baby . The string is too short to pull while walking ... I understand that this is a safety issue , but come on ! Having a pull toy that you ca n't pull along is kind of pointless.My second complaint is the buttons . They 're small , protrude outwareds , are very close together , and really close to the ground . If you have a medium to high pile carpet , this will wreak havoc on the toy . Not only are the buttons not very durable , but playing with the toy on carpet will trigger many inintended letters , which is probably pretty confusing for a little tyke.My third complaint is also button related . My daughter has pretty long legs , and as she 's sitting and playing on the floor with the toy , her feet set off buttons unintentionally while she 's pressing other buttons with her fingers . THe result ? You hear the letter `` J '' while the letter `` B '' is being pressed by a pudgy finger ! The upside to this toy for my daughter anyway is that she likes the music , particularly the xylophone instramental version of the ABC song . She 's not really much into anything else . It 's a cute toy , but I ended up exchanging it for the ABC Bus by LeapFrog instead . The buttons are a little further apart and are more easily distinguishable . The buttons on the bus are several inches above the ground and do not protrude out , so there ; s no chance of my daughter 's toes hitting letters unintentinally . They were the same price in our area , and for us it was a much better solution .	-1
I 'm sure you 've heard the phrase , `` Appearances are deceiving . '' Well , in this case , that being the Alphabet Pal by LeapFrog appearance IS deceiving . Oedipus as he 's called , looks reliable . In fact , his profile is quite impressive . Let me tell you , he 's an annoying little creature . Do n't be fooled by the brand name , and his adorable smile.My son received the caterpillar on his 1st Christmas . He was only 8-months old at the time , so I was n't expecting much , since the toy is recommended for children 12-months to 3-years . It was good that I was patient , because William showed NO interest in the caterpillar whatsoever . A year passed , and for the most part , the toy sat in the toy box . My husband and I tried to interest our son in the toy by pressing one of his legs . It would go into its irritating spiel , which would garner a smile from our little one , but that was the extent of it.Sometime later , when I was organizing the toys , Mr. Smarty-Pants who was about two at the time , came up behind me and pulled the caterpillar out of the toy box . He started dragging the bug around the house all the while it whined the alphabet song . My son was enjoying the toy when it suddenly went into a weird erratic seizure . Dah , dah , dah ... & % $ # @ ! It scared the wits out of him . Upon inspection , I noticed that the caterpillar only spazed when in the Music Mode . I also detected that 5 of the legs did not work at all ... that is , they did n't work in any mode . I think that 's shoddy for a toy that sat in a toy box for 2-years.The ProsThe NEW and improved version of the toy includes a `` That Tickles '' feature . When the toy is in the Phonics Mode , it 's capable of sounding-out short words like DAD . If one tries to sound-out a naughty word , the Alphabet Pal giggles and says `` That Tickles . '' I tried every bad word I can think of , so on this point LeapFrog excels.The ConsThe sound quality of the toy is good , but LeapFrog chose the MOST grating voice for this bug on wheels . It 's high-pitched shrill sounds like a 3 ' woman on helium . Every time the string is pulled it goes into this maddening version of the ABC song . Also , it has a verbal prompt that goes into idle mode if not turned OFF . It says , `` Thanks for learning with LeapFrog . Bu Bye ! '' On the caterpillar 's back is a small button , when pressed the bug introduces himself by saying , `` Hi , I 'm Alphabet Pal . '' If pressed a second time , the bug says , `` Hi , I 'm Oedipus . Let 's sing along with Alphabet Pal . '' The Oedipus voice is a little deeper , and not as irritating , but this is the only time we hear his voice . So , I 'm confused , is the toy 's name Alphabet Pal , or Oedipus ? Fortunately , there is a volume control , although my kid likes his toys in the Loud Mode ? The Low Mode on the Alphabet Pal is LOUD . The Loud Mode is TOO loud . As if that 's not bad enough , this toy is one of those exasperating playthings that goes-off in the toy box when the lid is lifted , or when walking by it when sitting on the floor.In addition , the braided pull-string is ridiculous . It 's only a foot long , so how is a child expected to stand and pull the toy along when walking . I understand the reason for the short length , but it would make more sense to add a handle as used on the Fisher-Price Popcorn Popper , or take the string off altogether . Our caterpillar has seen very little playtime , although the string is frayed and looks horrid.It 's been 2 years since I purchased the Alphabet Pal for my son , and we 're still on the original batteries . William 's received little to no education from the toy , as it just did n't interest him . I recycle everything that I can , but this toy is so aggravating that I ca n't even give it to the neighbor boy . His parents would kill me , thus it 's headed for the trash bin . Sorry LeapFrog , but I ca n't recommend this toy .	-1
My son seems to enjoy this toy okay but it drives me crazy . He did not use it when learning his ABCs ; he preferred a toy with buttons easier to push and larger letters . But he picks this one up every now and then . It has a music mode that plays short songs but if you even barely touch another button it changes to a different song . The string is too short to pull ; I am not sure of the purpose of it . I would get rid of this toy if my son did n't play with it at times . Overall I think it is annoying and would recommend getting a different ABC toy .	-1
I guess it 's true : All children are not alike . Certainly , neither one of my children ( now 3 and 5 ) would play with this toy . At a younger age , they did n't find pushing the legs and making noise much fun.At the toddling stage they just were n't the sort to 'pull ' a toy after them , especially as the string was too short and kept slipping out of their little fingers ( longer strings are considered 'safety hazards ' btw ) .And when they were older , past toddling , the alphabet and color aspects were just not interesting enough to sit down and play with.Two Stars for us . Leapfrog makes some awesome edutainment products , but not every toy is universally fun for all kids.The problem with this one , I think , is that the pull-toy aspect is mis-matched with the alphabet , preschooler , side of the toy . Certainly , my kids learned nothing from this toy , principally because when they were babies the alphabet meant nothing ; and when they were older , they did n't want to sit and play with a caterpillar .	-1
My son received this a few months ago for his first birthday . I did not expect much from this toy at first as the recommended age starts at 12 months . Now at almost 18 months , he still cares nothing for the toy . He does n't pull it along , push the buttons - NOTHING . If I turn it on , he looks around to see where the noise is coming from , but then goes back to playing with something else . It does not seem to matter what mode it is in , he just does n't seem interested . Also , the voice on this is slightly high-pitched and is annoying . I intend to give it a little more time to see if eventually he will become interested in this . Other children I know have not been interested in this toy either when they have received it as a gift , so I know it is not just my child . Sadly , as much as I have enjoyed his other LeapFrog toys , I would not recommend this one for fun color and alphabet learning .	-1
This would be a great toy and we would have kept it but quite frankly , the things it says is just downright disgusting . Boys learn those things soon enough and to hear this thing belch is just awful . It 's downright embarrassing to hear our son use this thing around company . No one can actually believe that someone would make a toy that says the things this lawnmower says . Ours went back and it 's quite a shame because it really is a cute mower otherwise . We replaced ours with a John Deere toy lawnmower and by far , it 's even better so our little guy loves it more than this Mike the mower . The John Deere has realistic sounds and actually sounds like a real mower . And , it goes through grass like a breeze . A great investment - the only downfall is that you can usually only find them at upper end toy stores or at John Deere dealerships ( where they 're usually about eight dollars cheaper than the toy stores ) . Buy hey , if you have to go to the dealership , then take your son and have a great time looking at all the `` tractor '' based toys ! Made for a great afternoon in our house , plus he got to take this lawnmower home ! Try to imagine mom driving home and a son in the back trying to mow in a carseat . That 's how exiting the John Deere lawnmower is - Mike the mower just ca n't compare and the quality . Wow ! Great deal for the money and tons of fun . I recommend the John Deere hands down .	-1
I hate this toy , which is a shame because both my 17 month old boy and almost 3 year old girl loves it . The little head on the mower chomps very , very noisily when pushed . To fix the noise issue , simply removing the batteries does nothing . We were gifted this by the grandparents for Christmas , along with the playskool vacuum which we love and is n't terribly loud . While they were playing with the lawn mower , we was unable to hear or communicate easily with the grandparents on our web cam because of the noise level . You can not keep this toy out if you have a napping small child and a playing older child . You can not talk on the phone , have a conversation with someone in the same room , or sleep if someone is playing with this toy . Bad for migraine sufferers . Terrible for pets/kids with fear of loud noises.Great if you keep it outdoors and your neighbors do n't mind .	-1
My mother in law got this for our daughter 's first birthday . Daddy 's name is Mike so she thought this was just the cutest thing because of the name . Well he lived in our closet for a week before being returned ! It scared the poop out of her ! It would start talking for no reason and the eyes would move around . We honestly thought it was possessed.My husband got it out to check it out to see if he could figure out what was wrong with it and get her to play with it . Well she finally would push it around but she kept going back to her Dusty ( the vacuum ) and leaving daddy to play with the mower . They had been playing about three phrases worth when the thing burped ! Then I started to listen to it ! It says some of the grossest and rudest things I have ever heard come out of a toy ! We hated to be rude to grandma but we told her Mike the mower was going back tot he store ! We bought the original Mike the Mower for my cousin 's youngest child a few years back . He was much more polite and cute ! So until the old Mike is back there 's only room for one Mike in our family and that is daddy !	-1
Received as a gift . It was difficult to put the pencils/crayons in their slots and seems like it will be a pain for my 5 yr old to remove them to do her artwork . It 's cheap plastic . Waste of money .	-1
I am also VERY disappointed in this case ! ! ! My son excitedly picked this out and I thought it would be PERFECT for him to keep all his supplies together and he would be able to carry it out to use any time . Well , like everyone else has already said ... .the parts inside that hold all the crayons , pencils , etc , do not attach to the actual red case so every time we open and close the case everything falls out . It 's so frustrating to my son that he does n't use it anymore or just trashes it . SOooooooo mad that Crayola could n't at least have attached the pieces together so they would n't fall out .	-1
I bought this to help my son organize art supplies , but it can not even fit all of the supplies it comes with . The markers are very difficult to get in , and there are not enough spaces for all of them . We just took the art supplies and trashed the case .	-1
It should be the `` ultimate kit '' .. well it 's not .. the case is junky , the pencils fall apart and are to lil .. there is n't much to any of the supplies .. you can spend four dollars in rose art supplies and get this much and better quality .. because this does n't even seem like crayola quality ..	-1
Not much compared to the screen'sScreen inside the case and confirmed cases andoegin well , butThey 're not that great customized bonikka caseIt looks like cheap stuff.Easily fall inside the case to hold the pencil and absurd.If you live in the United States , have been returned goods .	-1
I really like the feel & smell of this everyday type of lotion , but I wo n't use it on anyone I love because it has artificial red coloring . Research the harm this can do , for yourself , before using such a lotion . Instead , perhaps you could try the natural Weleda or California Baby Lotions .	-1
My daughter received this as a present when she was a year old and only played with it a few times . She liked the music though and would press the musical note on the side to here the music . Its to hard for a one year old to press on and make an impression even using the tools that came with it . My 4 year old can paint on it though .	-1
The age factor on this toy is VERY wrong . I thought it was such a great idea but as the other reviewers have said , you have to push down so hard on the screen to make an impression that younger children wo n't be able to play with it . My little one is almost 3 now and has had it for 1.5 years . He 's finally able to use it and actually enjoys it . It 's really cute when he makes an impression of his foot ! That should give you some idea on how hard it is to make an impression on the screen - he stands on it ! It 's fun for a little while , but it can get boring too so all-in-all , I would pass on this toy and look for something more user friendly for younger children .	-1
What a great idea ! A toy that babies can get creative with and not get messy ! If only it worked ... The surface is blue `` goop '' but enclosed in a strong plastic film so as you `` fingerpaint '' on the `` goop '' you are n't getting any on your fingers . As the the `` goop '' is moved aside by your fingers bright colours are revealed behind to make your work of art even more colourful . There are stampers as well to make shapes . To clear the screen you simply move the bar up and down ( like a Magna Doodle ) and start over . And to make it even more fun when you press down on the screen music plays . There is a stand as well - making it easy for sitting babies to draw.Unfortunately the toy did not live up to our expectations . You must press quite firmly on the `` goop '' screen to make an a good impression and to get the music to play . My daughter was never able to press hard enough to make the music work . And when any sort of pressure was applied the stand would collapse . The stampers just kind of make a blob in the `` goop '' and not a nice clear image as you would expect . To clear the screen you must move the bar up and down at least 5 - 10 times to make a clear surface . My daughter had no interest in it at all.This toy is disappointing and I would n't recommend it . Try a Magna Doodle when your baby is a bit older - now that is a great creative toy that works !	-1
In theory this toy works -- in reality it stinks ! Fisher Price is known for interesting , good quality toys for kids , so buying this for our one year old 's birthday was a no-brainer for me and my husband . Upon opening the box , the toy already had a & quot ; sketch & quot ; on it , faded color spots in one corner and would not wipe clean to start a new drawing no matter how hard we pressed the clear bar . This toy reminded us of the old time carbon wipe off boards ( remember those from the 5 & amp ; dime store ? ) where you scratched designs with a plastic stick and then ripped up the top plastic sheet to clear the slate and start again . Well those cheap originals worked better than this Musical Fingerpaint toy ! Not even the music was clear , in fact it worked only some of the time , and the surface was so tough that you 'd have to press down with a solid object alot stronger than a toddler 's finger in order to make a design . Then once you do manage to draw something , it is virtually impossible to clear it to start over . Needless to say , we returned it promptly and bought something more practical , a Baby Leap Pal , and our daughter loves it . Sorry , Fisher Price , you get an & quot ; F & quot ; for this one .	-1
I was very excited about this toy , thinking it was an excellent idea . Unfortunately , it has n't really lived up to its price tag . The screen is way , way , way too hard for my 15 month old to make impressions on . I can draw on it ; my 8-year-old son can draw on it , as well , but he has to be careful not to use his fingernails . The baby , though , for whom it was bought , ca n't make marks without a concentrated , sustained & quot ; push & quot ; , and he 's a pretty rough little boy ! He does enjoy pulling out/replacing the little shapes on the bottom , and he does enjoy pushing the musical note on the side to make music play . He also enjoys sitting/standing/running in place on it to make music ( this is a VERY durable toy ! ) . It is n't used to draw , though , which is a shame . I 'm glad some families have gotten good use out of theirs , but I , personally , would have to tell anyone who asked to save their money for a more toddler-friendly toy . ( Side note : My toy does n't have the easel on the back , either , although it does have the hollowed-out , shaped space for one . Maybe they 've stopped including it ? )	-1
This is the worst toy . Completely worthless . It is bulky and takes up room and is not fun at all . You have to press too hard to make a picture and it 's impossible to & quot ; fingerpaint & quot ; because it does not stay pressed in where you push it . It makes loud obnoxious music . YOu are better off getting a box of crayons and some plain paper and drawing pictures with your child .	-1
I just bought this for my younger son for his first birthday . The package says for 9 mos + . We have had it less than a week and have problems.First , the music actually made my son upset when he touched it so I had to shut it off . Also , the soft cover needs alot of pressure for the colors to be seen . Even the plastic shapes that come with the toy do n't work unless I press hard and twist them a little . This is definitely not for an infant . The picture on the package is very misleading.As others have noted , the stand is not very sturdy at all . In fact my son tried to use the toy to lean on and stand himself up . My 3-year old actually was able to remove part of the stand from the holder . I should have left the toy in it 's box to see if my younger son would even play with it . That way I could have returned it .	-1
This toy is not only hazaderous , but it is a hunk of junk . The balls always end up in the mouth-although they might not be able to be swallowed-they do get stuck in their mouths . The hammer gets lost to easily . It is rather annoying and the kids loose interest in it too quickly for the price . Not recommended-make better use of your money .	-1
We bought this for our 7 month old daughter and ended up taking it back . It is too hard for her to reach in and get the balls out without hurting her hand or pushing them back where she ca n't get to them . It needs to have a wider opening where the balls drop out .	-1
my 1year old daughter has already put a hole through the tamborine after dropping it and it landed on a pebble *while playing with it at her birthday party and just received it moments before..i might add* , the clacker thing is held together with a cheap piece of elastic rope ... which she has already undone and lost the 1 piece..the maracas are bad ... they 're not loud or any thing..it sounds like there are 4 or 5 grain of rice inside..and the wooden instrument ... she has no interest in it musically ... but she likes chewing on them ... .the symbols , and triangle are ok ... simply due to they make sharp loud noise ... which is what she likes ... i 'm not happy with this purchase AT ALL ...	-1
Daughter got this as a gift . The maracas are so muffled you can not hear the sound when you shake it ! ! My daughter loves the tambourine though . It is her favorite part of this . Be careful of the wooden pallet it comes in , it seems that Melissa and doug does not sand their wood , so its easy to get a splinter . Ouch !	-1
I wish I had read the reviews on this product before I bought it . We have several other M & D products for our son and they all are good quality . My son received the band in a box for his 3rd birthday . The tamborine was broken in about 2 minutes , shorter than it took to get all the instruments out of the box ! He 's been to various music classes and most kids bang anything on anything to make music . So , when he hit the tamborine with the wooden stick from the box , none of us were expecting it to shatter . We returned it to the store , thinking maybe it was just bad luck . When we got the second one home , it lasted 30 minutes . Mostly because I was playing the tamborine . Then as we were putting the instruments back in the box , my son hit the tamborine with the metal rod from the triangle . Shattered again . Now we have to decide whether to bring it back again and find something else or just tear off the broken skin and use it like that . If the tamborine is so delicate it should n't be in a box of instruments for 3 years+ .	-1
I bought this for my 2 year old . I was envisioning her walking around the house making all matter of joyful noise . Not so much . The maracas would make more noise if they were run over by a tire . Seriously , you can hardly hear them . The cymbals are really little and the tambourine does n't have much sound either unless you are holding it in the throes of a seizure . Fortunately , no seizures in this house and these are toys ended up packed away .	-1
The Melissa & Doug Wooden Take Along Tool Kit ( 24pc ) is another disappointment for this grandma . Having our first grandchild allowed my husband and I to , once again , indulge in toy purchasing . We had heard good things about Melissa & Doug products , so when I received an e-mail about a half-price sale , I asked my daughter which items she would like to have for her son . Because his Papa is a woodworker and all-around handyman , she thought our grandson would enjoy having his own toolkit . We had high hopes that the Melissa & Doug Wooden Take Along Tool Kit ( 24pc ) would become a favorite toy.Unfortunately , we had to take this away from our grandson shortly after giving it to him . The product is made in China and the wood used in its construction is a cheap and results in potentially harmful products . The threading of the screws caused firring so that little ones who might be inclined to test-taste their toys could , potentially , get splinters in their mouth . I did not like the fact that the paint used on the Melissa & Doug Wooden Take Along Tool Kit ( 24pc ) comes off easily when a child chews , even slightly , on the pieces . Several articles discussing recalls of these products in Canada convinced me that Melissa & Doug toys needed to be removed from our future-purchase list.The tight fit of the nails and screws on the toy we received proved to discourage our grandson from playing with the Melissa & Doug Wooden Take Along Tool Kit ( 24pc ) . Further , the less-than-realistic shapes of the tools and assorted other items did nothing to attract our grandson 's interest . He wanted tools like Papa 's . We purchased the Fisher-Price Drillin ' Action Tool Set when we saw it , and it was a real hit . That toy definitely is worth your purchase.I would not recommend purchasing the Melissa & Doug Wooden Take Along Tool Kit ( 24pc ) . There are far better toolbox-type toys on the market .	-1
This toy looks cute and the reviews raved about how much fun 2 year olds had playing with it . There are two pegs to hammer into the side holes , and that was fun for a few minutes for my grandson . The wooden hammer really does n't look much like a hammer . There are many screws and nuts and wooden strips with holes , but there is really nothing you can make with them . So unless your child enjoys sitting and screwing nuts on pegs , I would n't waste my money on this product .	-1
I bought this for my grandson when he was about 2 1/2 . I has been a total disappointment , even at age 3.Nails & hammer : At first , he really enjoyed hammering in the 2 nails into the holes in the side of the toolbox . But an strong adult needs to pull the nails out . I ca n't do it . He really hammers hard ! Hammering the nails is the only part of the toy that he liked , but he lost interest . Even at 3 yr. - I ca n't get him to play with it.Screws , washers , screwdriver & wrench : The holes in the side of the toolbox are TOO BIG for the screws . The 6 screws are over 2 '' long and there are washers that can be screwed on . However , it is so much easier to use your fingers to fasten the washers , so the screwdriver is n't needed . And it is useless to try to use the wrench to unfasten them . *** A toddler can not use the screwdriver while holding the washer in place all by himself . He does n't have enough hands.I called Melissa & Doug , thinking I was n't teaching him how to use the toy correctly . The rep. said we should connect the brackets with the screws to make interesting designs or - I 'm not sure what . But I did try to show him . No Fun !	-1
We received this as a reward through a diapers program , and it was great to get it for `` free '' . However , I do n't think I would pay more than $ 10.00 for this if I were purchasing it myself . As another reviewer mentioned , it is n't a very useful or functional tool box . In fact , the only thing that my 2 year old likes about it anymore is the hammer and screwdriver , and she does n't even use them with the nails and screws that came with the kit . The good things about the toy are its construction ( solid wood ) and its bright colors . Also , one of the nuts would n't thread onto the bolt , so we had to throw the bolt away . Once again , not a big deal , but only because it was `` free '' .	-1
This tool box has way too many 'pieces ' and not enough tools . And the tools are not very realistic either ( more of a mallet than a hammer ) . The wood has splintered and the paint is chipping off too . The screws are untouchable , and we have had to throw a lot of them away because the splinters are so bad after having been threaded a few times in the holes . Not at all impressed with this tool kit . The Green Toys tool box is leaps and bounds better than this one . Not only is it made from recycled material with no chemicals , but the tools look and work like real tools . We have had both tool boxes for over a year , and my son uses the Green Toys one nearly every day , but barely touches this Melissa & Doug one .	-1
I bought this shape sorter for my daughter . After only a few times playing with it , the paint started to chip off of the blocks.Very poorly made .	-1
This toy is so crappy , like most Melissa & Doug toys , the paint chips and the wood has splinters . Very poor quality . I also hate the fact that Melissa & Doug toys are made in China , major con in my book . Also , I can not stand the & # 34 ; predictable & # 34 ; dark colors . Well , you get what you pay for . Save your money and buy a better quality shape sorter elsewhere . Green Toys , for instance , have a really nice shape sorter which is completely non-toxic & made from recycled plastic here in the USA .	-1
What a waste of wood . The lid falls off when you turn it to put peices in the side . I ca n't believe Lights , Camera , Interaction made this .	-1
This just is n't much fun for the kids . They got so frustrated that it has n't been touched again . I do not recommend this at all . Ages 2-5 yrs none of them liked it .	-1
Unfortunately , I bought this toy on a whim at the store when I usually read reviews first and I highly regret it . This product is of very poor quality . We have owned it for 2 days . Like others have said , the lid is too easy to remove and just slides right out by merely turning the cube . Not too much of an issue ( right now anyway ) because my kid is of an age where she just likes to remove the shapes from the box and not put them back . What concerns me the most though are the splinters . Mine has splinters of a good enough size that they could be a choking hazard on in addition to `` just '' poking into skin . The box is just splintering off around the shape holes . I took this immediately away from my child . Too bad . I 'm going to try and return it .	-1
I am not happy with this shape sorting cube ... my 21 month old daughter has n't at all be interested in it yet . To get the shapes out , one side of the cube slides out , but the problem is that it slides out so easily that it does n't stay in place at all when searching for the right opening for the cubes ! One side is a plank of wood with no openings ... not very attractive . There are also a lot of different shapes , it takes a lot of patience to figure them all out and it is frustrating . Love Melissa and Doug , but not happy with this shape sorter .	-1
There are too many shapes for our 14 month old . There are rhombuses , paralellograms , pentagons , hectagons , and octogons . All those similar , complicated shapes are better suited to a 4-5 year old rather than a 2 year old ( as the manufacturer suggests ) . I do n't know a 4 or 5 year old who wants to sit around and put shapes into a box.Very pretty , love the wood , great concept ... Not well executed .	-1
A complete waste of money -- the child can not manipulate the cube to look at different sides , because there is no latch that holds the lid on ! It simply falls off , and all the shape blocks fall out , too . Very angry to have purchased this . What a ripoff .	-1
This very difficult shape shorter . I would guess that 3+ is a better age range . The shapes are very similar and sized the same . If I sort them by side my 2yold can do it but he does n't really enjoy it . We have another that is much more fun.Also , the lid comes off for no reason . I ca n't see any reason why they would design it this way . At the very least , how about a hinge ? Child labor too expensive in China ? Like many M & D ; toys , you get what you pay for ...	-1
The top on this toy slides off too easily so the blocks are constantly falling out when you turn it over and around . Also , some of the shapes are really similar so it 's a little discouraging when the shape looks like it would fit but it does n't because it 's slightly different than the hole . I think it would be better if the holes were color coded with the shapes .	-1
Melissa and Doug Products could use some work..We bought the shape sorter for christmas and not 2 weeks later the top split . Now there is no top and 3 blocks are basically useless . Also the paint on the blocks does n't stay on very well . We ordered about ten differen M & D ; products and really are n't happy with quality , size or construction . The paints on most of their products is already coming off or chipping away . The wood on some has broken or splintered away . Now I must say our daughter is 11 months old and not rough on any of them.I would be careful if you do purchase and keep plenty of glue around for all the broken pcs .	-1
We usually LOVE Melissa and Doug toys and were so sad that this one did n't work out for us.The concept is fantastic -- a wooden shape sorter that helps with important developmental skills while being eco-friendly and safe for children ( no dangerous paints or chemicals ) .The execution on this item is not good . First , it has very sharp corners and the wood is flimsy . I do n't feel comfortable with my toddler playing with this -- too worried he will hurt himself . We have lots of wooden toys , and they all have rounded corners and a soft finish . But this shape sorter is rough and not well made . The wood is thin and cheap . It looks and feels very cheap.Second , the shapes and colors are so similar to each other that its easy to get confused . The designers should have put more thought into use of colors and shapes.A disapointment for us .	-1
The board is in horrible condition . I ordered it in February and kept it in my towel pantry closet , which is dry . Did n't open it until today , in June because the kids were restless . I almost cut my finger on the board taking it out of the box , the thin top layers have separated and split from the thicker wood on top and bottom . Very disappointed in the quality of this game board . Now I have to glue the board together . Oh what fun !	-1
This checkers/chess set is irritating . The board is thick and durable , but it is also small . When you stack the checkers to `` king '' someone , the top piece easily slides off because there are no ridges on the checkers . I am returning it .	-1
the lid will not stay on . so the sand is never dry and the lid is always in the ditch . wish I had never gotten it .	-1
Had to give this to younger children as my 7 year old was not interested in such a simplistic game .	-1
I was so excited to get this game , thanks to raving reviews here on Amazon and on another website . The game has a nice theme with pretty , over-sized cards and a superfluous board , but it 's really nothing more than a glorified version of rummy . I just wish I would have known about test-playing it online before wasting my money on this one .	-1
As noted in many of my other relevant game reviews , I 'm I am always looking for games I can play with my fiance . She is what some would call a & # 34 ; reluctant gamer & # 34 ; whereas I am an avid gamer , so I have be careful about what games I introduce her to . She prefers games that rely at least a little on luck ( i.e. , not all strategy ) and are n't too complex ( i.e. , where you can learn/remember the mechanic after a game or two ) , whereas I love strategy and complexity but do n't mind a little luck . We also like games you can finish in a single session ( or games you can play multiple times in a single session ) .Lost Cities had a lot going for it most of these ways . It is an interesting game with a good combo of luck in terms of what cards you randomly draw , and strategy in terms of some non-random card choices and how or when you play or discard various cards . But , the game itself had nothing to do with the theme ( which was a bit of a turn off but not a deal breaker ) , and unfortunately the mechanic just didn & # 8217 ; t do it for us . Glad we tried it , but I doubt it will get much play in our house at this point .	-1
I normally do my research on boardgames before I buy them . As such , I watched a couple of reviews on youtube and comparative `` best Board Games '' lists online.Why buy this game ? I did n't . I just use a deck of cards and change the starting investment to -25 per suit . Works like a dream . Save some money .	-1
The game 's scoring is too time-consuming , it 's hard to predict who 's in the lead with farmer points , and the game gets old fast . The winner is almost always the person who most greedily puts down farmers and makes the simplest and least daring plays in other respects . The fact that nobody else can even plan what they 're going to do ( barring implementation of house rules ) while waiting for their turn ( having no tiles in their hands ) leads to people wandering off or playing with their smartphones or getting into conversations , causing huge delays.If you 're mean-spirited , it 's too easy to screw your friends over with negligible effect on your own chances of winning , leading to a lot of pointless tit-for-tat revenge moves.It 's very , very difficult to know how well you 're doing until the game is almost over , although if you make a few wrong decisions on peasant placement early on , you 'll be left with no scoring pieces and will be completely shut out and incapable of making any meaningful moves for most of the rest of the game.Do NOT buy ANY of the expansions . They do n't add much , if anything , to the game . You 'll also be tempted to use the expansion tiles just to make a bigger map with the original game rules , which just leads to everyone getting bored and giving up half-way through !	-1
I enjoyed my first playing of Carcassonne , and I enjoyed discovering its basic strategies ( by my mistakes ! ) . But I have not enjoyed any of my subsequent playings of Carcassonne , because ... Ultimately Carcassonne is about guessing which parts of which range of tiles will grow in a timely enough manner to earn relatively more points . Different parts are worth different points , depending . And accumulating points means this game is largely about math ( although there is more to it ) . The math is just counting and addition , but this type of math feels tedious to me . Some other people do enjoy this type of game.One fawning reviewer says Carcassonne is nice because -- `` there are n't long periods of boredom '' . That is true for a few board games for groups ( including the nice game BigBoggle ) , but in a 4 person game of Carcassonne you spend 3/4 of your time waiting . Carcassonne exacerbates this problem by needlessly not letting you have your one tile until it is finally your turn again , preventing the fun and speed-up from planning ( this rule can be overridden by popular outcry ) .A fawning reviewer wrote that the `` farmers '' feature of Carcassonne is too much for younger players . He is right , because the farmers feature adds even more guesswork and math to count.It is funny that exposure to Settlers of Catan leads so many people to try/buy Carcassonne . The two games are not similar in any way , except that the game pieces are of higher quality than what other game companies market to us.Other commercial board games I enjoy include Khet , Quoridor , and Twixt ; although they are for only 2 people , not groups .	-1
We have the old version of this phone . Im not sure if this one has a cord that is on the front of it but ours did . Im writing this to warn everyone who is upset that the cord on this toy is too short . Ours had a cord for the phone and a cord to pull the toy with . I was in making dinner one day and i heard some crying and i walked in to find both of the two cords got tangled some how around one of my little boys neck ! when i got it off there was a deep purple indent on his poor neck . Now i know some people might be saying i need to watch my babies more but only a mother of twins would understand how hard it is . Now the cord to pull the toy has been cut off , they still like the toy however . Im just glad i got to him in time .	-1
My 9 month old got the cord wrapped around her neck . It is dangerous.The voice is hard to understand . It says `` Will you help me call my fwiends '' . Uses baby talk . Talks whenever it wants to . No on/off switch.My daughter does not like it . No one has a phone like it anymore .	-1
My daughter has been playing with the Fisher Price Grand Piano which is by far better than this piano . Fisher Price Grand Piano has the keys light up , has different modes for music , learning ( numbers 1-8 , colors , pitch , and rhythm ) , also you can play the piano by tapping the individual keys.This particular Rock and Roll Piano does n't light up , plays different types of musical instruments , but the keys are n't as fun to play . My daughter played it a few times and went straight back to the Grand Piano . Consider buying that one instead .	-1
I bought this for our son after seeing the commercial on TV & the glowing ratings here ( to bad I didnt look at the bad ratings first ) . When it arrived the first dissapointment was to see the item was made in China - this promted my curiosity about the `` water '' in the toy , I went to the Fisher Price web site & found it unbelievable that they have NO WAY to contact them via e-mail ! The next frustration was that of several others here that the straps were to short for our nice crib ( newer convertible type ) . Being in a foul mood at this point I had my wife call their customer no service # to discuss the water & if they had longer straps ( they dont have the straps - dont these people test their products in the real world ? I think not ) . Their reply as to the safety of the water was that is was `` proprietary '' information & could not be disclosed ! After many atempts to get info on this & talking to a `` supervisor '' same answer . We think this is totally uneceptable & will not be buying any Fisher Price products in the future ( which we told them but they dont seem to care ) . I would have sent this thing back except I foolishly had trashed the packageing already .	-1
We have had this thing for a while . I have everything from the Ocean Wonders Series . While I am extremely happy with most of the other items , this item was rarely ever used with my son . The music did not soothe him when he was worked up , and it has never once put him to sleep . The fish and clam in it has never been able to catch his attention for more than half of a second . He will listen to the music while I change his diaper , but that does n't last very long . Maybe the company should try again .	-1
I loved this toy - but my daughter ( 4 months old ) does n't . She is not very interested in it , and cries at the sound of many of the songs . Maybe when she is older she will like it more ? I liked the visuals and the bubbles , but it does not hold or attract her attention at this age !	-1
Well , I love the ocean and everything in it and about it . My daughters room is decorated with a `` fishy '' theme . However , I was n't impressed with this at all ! First off , the batteries wear out too quick ! And yes , I DID turn it off when she was n't using it . And yes , I DID use new batteries . Also , the fish that `` swim '' get stuck and do n't move and the glitter clumps into one spot . The balls were a hit though ! She loves those !	-1
This is a very attractive toy . The ocean sounds are so realistic you feel as if you were on the beach . That is my impression . My grandson ( 10 months ) however has a different view.For the first day or so after the toy arrived he would pick the balls up and hold them in his hands while trying to get the little items inside to spin around . However , they would only spin once or twice and stop . He would push the bowl around and listen to the ocean sound for a bit but it was too heavy for him to get it to make the splashing sound . I had to jiggle the bowl in order for him to hear that . He never quite got the `` dropping the balls in the bowl '' part . He would drop them in and nothing , to him anyway , would happen so that ended pretty quick.He has n't played with it since that first day or two after it arrived.I would not recommend this product unless you are looking for a nice item to put on your child 's shelf .	-1
This toy was a gift from my daughter 's aunt . We bought her duaghter the same toy ! I thought she would like it ... and she did for about five minutes ! All it does is light up and play a song . My daughter plays with the balls more than the actual toy . Not a very good idea . What is the point of this toy ? Also , it is extremely heavy , which makes it kind of dangerous ! !	-1
The questions in this game are fine . They did seem a little more difficult than some other versions , but my complaints are almost solely on the design . The board is flimsy . It feels something like one of those games you might cut out of the back of a cereal box , and there are maybe half as many cards as in the standard versions . What you are paying for is the fancy-schmancy plastic card dispenser that does n't work ! You 're supposed to just slide a card out and start reading , but you usually end up holding two or three . What was so difficult about taking the cards out of a box ? The game is a classic . You do n't need to redesign it every time , just make more cards .	-1
Yikes ! There 's trivial , but then there 's ridiculous . If you 're over 30 , playing this game is laughable . So obscure are some of the questions and answers -- that it 's really more of a guessing game than one that tests your knowledge . It 's too bad , since previous editions are fun . And sorry , I agree that the card dispenser can be a bit aggravating -- just give us the box to hold the cards in ! ! ! Why fix it if it ai n't broken ?	-1
I had to have this for my son before he was even born . He got it for Christmas at six months old . He was excited as he also has a Pooh that talks when you press letters on his belly . However , the rattle is too big and hard for a six month old . He also does not understand to shake the rattle to get Pooh moving and gets frustrated , so we wind up pushing the belly . Also , when my son hits himself with the rattle , it hurts . It is rock hard plastic.It is nearly impossible to understand what the doll is saying and the movements are jerky . I am wondering if something is wrong with it actually . If that is how it is supposed to sound , it 's terrible .	-1
Its loud , no volume controlIts clunky , not soft at all , when he 's dancing kids cant hold him , It has NO STUFFING , so when kids try to hold it its not cudley , you can feel all the solid parts through elmo.ALL THIS TOY DOES IS SING THE SAME SONG AND MAKE SOME HORRIBLE NOISE THAT DOESNT EVEN SOUND LIKE A CHICKEN.I wish I spent the money on something else.No educational value , not fun , kind of scary , cant hug it , lots of HARD plastic on elmo .	-1
This toy was not a hit with my kids . The pegs that hold the paper in each side constantly fall out . The game only comes with 8 sheets of cover page which runs out very quickly . Have not found a re-fill in the stores . This toy has been shelved .	-1
I had a Lite-Brite as a kid and loved it , so I was enthused to pick this up for my kids ( 4 and 6 ) . What a disappointment.The only thing positive I 'll say about it is that the 4-sided configuration , allowing more than one kid to play at once , is actually a very good idea Everything else about this Lite-Brite Cube is absolutely idiotic in terms of design for play value.- The pegs fall out- The pattern sheets , held only by pegs , fall off- The letters on the patterns that tell you what color peg to use are too small to be seen by small kids- The trays are too shallow and the pegs spill out- The tray have no covers for storage ( in the version I have ) - The frame is made of translucent white plastic that lets too much light through- The device has no on/off switch , meaning you have to plug/unplug it for play- The top is held with screws , making the bulb harder to tighten when the kids inevitably jiggle it looseThe thing that really burns me is that every point above could have been rectified very easily with just a little re-engineering . Flange the pegs slightly ; angle the faces a few degrees ; add clamps for the patterns ; ; use a bolder font ; use opaque plastic in the case ; add a toggle switch to the chord ; attach the top with latches instead of screws . A few simple modifications that any thinking person can come up with would make this an exponentially better toy without adding much to the cost of manufacture.But no . The maker opted for the absolute cheapest properties and you get stuck with something more likely to frustrate than amuse your kids . Drives me bats . Cheaply made , poorly thought out . Does n't have to be that way.Do n't know about you , but I 'd gladly pay upwards of $ 25 for a toy like this that my kids would actually use . Instead , I paid ten bucks for a useless hunk of plastic . Sound like a bargain ? -- mm	-1
I GOT THIS LIGHT BRIGHT FOR MY 7 YEAR OLD VISUALLY IMPAIRED SON TO HELP WITH FINE MOTOR AND THINKING IT WOULD BE LIKE THE OLD LIGHTBRIGHTS . HE HAS AN OLD ONE AT HIS G'MAS THAT HE ENJOYS.ON THE LIGHT BRIGHT CUBE YOU MUST USE THE PAPER OR THE PEGS FALL OUT . FOR HIM FEELING THE HOLES TELLS HIM WHERE TO PUT THE PEGS AND WHEN YOU PUT THE PAPER ON HE CAN NOT FEEL THE HOLES ! I REMEMBER THE OLD LIGHT BRIGHTS THAT YOU COULD USE THE PAPER OR NOT AND THE PEGS STILL STAYED IN , THESE PEGS FALL OUT WITHOUT THE PAPER . IT WAS A DISSAPOINTMENT . GUESS I WILL LOOK FOR THE OLD STYLE AT A YARDSALE .	-1
I do n't want anyone else to be as frustrated by this as we are , so I 'm actually going to throw this in the garbage.The big problem can be summed up as : THE PEGS FALL OUT . Whenever you try to put pegs close to one another , you 'll knock out any pegs in the nearby vicinity . The old Lite Brites were angled , which helped to keep the pegs in . This cube is straight , so gravity pulls the pegs right out . They 're not designed properly to stay in.The model I have does not look like the one pictured with the slide-out drawers , so I 'll skip giving it a hard time over that particular feature ... but it looks identical in terms of the cube itself . And that 's the problem . My 4-year-old could n't do this at all , so I basically put the whole design together myself . And narrowly avoided cursing at least 8 times . I tried different techniques , like `` pre-holing '' the holes nearby when I was about to put pegs close together . It made very little difference . I had to keep redoing it over and over.If you can manage to get a whole design done , yes , it still looks cool like you remember from your youth . But getting there is no fun at all . I hope my daughter does n't notice when I toss this thing out . Just so aggravating that it 's not worth it .	-1
this was n't sturdy . I like the fact there was 4 sides , but it was horrible and did n't last had to throw it out because it was so cheaply made	-1
This lite-Brite is a piece of junk ! Do n't wast your money ! Maybe if I were n't comparing it to the older one I would think it was ok but even then I am not sure . I loved my lite-brite as a kid and wanted to get my daughter one so she could have as much fun as I did with mine.This has not left the box since the first day . First all of the screens where you stick the pegs are white not black like the old one so without the refill sheets it is useless.Also without the refill sheets the pegs are too big and they do not stay in.This was very frustrating ! Even with the sheets sometimes they still fall out ! I am really unhappy with this purchase and I can usually find something about a toy I like but not this one . I just did n't want anyone to be deceived into thinking that the screens were black and you could make your own `` art '' .	-1
Returned this product . I thought by the picture it was much nicer and sturdier . The boxes were very cheap and looked like it would n't last	-1
Once again I should have listened to what others were saying about this product . Everything was so small , especially the plates and cups . Some of the utensils were ok but most were very cheaply made . After we gave them to our daughter , within the next day we took the majority of small stuff away ( are in the process of replacing with a higher quality product ) . I usually read the reviews and take them seriously , I have made two purchases this past month both on Amazon , I read the reviews on both purchases , I should have not purchases them based on the reviews but I did anyway and now I am writing disappointing reviews on both items . Reviews pay off ! ! !	-1
When I ordered this item , I thought it would be durable , at least . The instant I removed it from the packaging , I could tell that the entire thing , the base as well as the upper area that houses the frog , including the lid , was made of the kind of thin , disposable plastic that holds a doll in place in a package . No kidding . If you push in with your finger , it gives in . I was amazed that it even held water . The cave is tiny , maybe for a just-grown froglet . We needed something asap for a frog my son caught in a pond and I GUESS this is better than a sand bucket with a plate on top , but just barely . What is funny is that the feeding hole at the top has a plastic cap that is inset and you remove the cap to put in live bugs . That cap is made of a heavier , stronger type of plastic than the entire container . I really feel ripped off by this product and I am surprised at Uncle Milton . I should have gotten the Discovery Kids Frog Habitat , which we have had in the past and was made of regular heavy plastic , like a fish tank . The only reason I did n't get that again is because it has crevices that are impossible to clean and make the whole thing smell badly . At least it was not made of lightweight , disposable plastic casing . I do not have experience with ordering tadpoles because we caught our frog . When I put the lid back on this tank , I push the sides in so that the sides will conform to the shape of the lid , that 's how flimsy it is . I would not recommend this product to anyone nor would I buy it if I had seen it in person to see how lightweight and flimsy the plastic is . The entire product is really , really just the thickness of one of those heavy-duty Solo brand beer cups , no kidding .	-1
My child received this product as a gift for Christmas . The quality of this product is beyond poor . Very cheap . Plastic is very thin , flimsy , bendable . You could actually tear/rip the plastic if you wanted to . Do n't waste your money . Invest in a higher quality terarium . Beyond me how this product could even be manufactured and sold ! Very disappointed . Considering sending back and purchasing a much better quality terarium for the same price and much easier to clean .	-1
We finally received our tadpoles in November ! How fun it was to watch them swim in their new plastic ( flimsy ) home . Ack ... I knew at some point I would have to buy them a real tank , but thought I 'd see if they turned into frogs first . The months past and nothing happened ... November , December , January , February , March , April and whoah now mid-May . We finally got a froglet ! He was adorable with his new legs ! He swam around like a kid just learning how to ride a bike ! Ahh but his crappy home was the beginning of the end . He got his leg caught in the ledge and died a half hour later . : - ( We still have 1 more tadpole we are waiting on here . I will be out today buying him a new home so he does n't end up like his friend . VERY sad to watch happen . I 'm sorry I did n't just buy a real tank from day 1 .	-1
Let me start out by saying I am a big fan of little people & had them as a child & have bought them for my child . BUT I really dislike this toy ! ! It looks like lots of fun but the cars wo n't loop the loop & stay on the track which is pretty much the whole idea of the toy . The ferris wheel & swing are mildly entertaining but my daughter ignored the entire set until she realized that some ( & only some ) of her hot wheels cars will run the loop completely . Fortunately , I did n't have to pay a dime for this toy as I got it free from a Pampers giveaway but unfortunately my belief in Little people has been tainted & I will be more careful when purchasing them . I really thought their standards were higher but I guess this one slipped through their qc department ! ! !	-1
This set looks like a lot of fun , but it is just not all I expected , nor what my kids like . The parts come off way to easily ( ie : the ferris wheel and swings ) , the cars do not do the loopydyloop very well , leading to frustration , you have to get it on JUST RIGHT and even than ... it does n't usually work , even for an adult . This toy is hardly ever played with , it lost its appeal the week that my daughter got it for her first birthday a year ago and has hardly been touched since . Usually the little people sets have been a winner , but this one is not worth the money and space it takes up . Unfortunately it is rather large , and when a toy that large is not played with ... well I consider it a waste of space . The Little People Farm set is played with on regular basis as well as the bus and safari set . We have the sets from a few years ago when Fisher price did n't have to put noises on ALL their toys ! BUT , that is a pet peave that I wo n't go into today .	-1
This toy was my first Fisher-Price purchase for my son and it was a complete waste of time and money ! ! The top of Roller Coaster kept coming off and the loop track came off very easily . ( which my son had around his neck in a matter of seconds . ) The ferris wheel and flying planes , grew tiresome after a few minutes . My son still plays with the smaller Fisher-Price sets , but the Fun Park was sent back to the store two days later !	-1
when giving 2 stars . My 16 month old recieved this for christmas . Yes he likes the little people , and he does enjoy the cars and placing the people on the ferris wheel and airplane ride . But , that 's it . He repeatly takes off the roller coaster loops and the toy is then useless . They should have designed the loops better . It 's a shame . It looks better in the box .	-1
was to climb up & get things that are out of reach ! That 's not what I intended for it to do at all . I bought this for my child when she was a little over two years old . She was past the pull up & stand stage , but I figured she could learn a few things or at least have fun . Well , we set this up easily enough , and unlike other reviewers have said , our table was very steady ( must have gotten lucky ) , but this can have a downside . Well , my daughter was happy with it for a few weeks . She especially liked the little purple open/close door , but after that , she did n't touch it at all . Then it became more than a pain ( for us parents ) than a pleasure . Like I said , our table was very steady so my daughter frequently used it to get to things high up that she normally could n't reach . I almost wished it were n't steady , so she 'd be afraid to climb up on it . She also began using the hole behind the purple door as a spit cup ( trust me , it 's even more unpleasant than it sounds ) . Also , like many people have said before me , the purple door comes off very easily . I got extremely sick of replacing it time and time again . About six months after I bought the toy , it went up into our attic , and I doubt it 'll come down again ( in fact , I 'm thinking of throwing it out ) . It 's just a major pain in the you know what , and it takes up a lot of space , especially if you have a lot of toys and a small house.About the other features : I thought the little instruments were cute , but my daughter was n't interested in them . The jazzy sound is different . I did n't think the female singing voice was all that bad . On loud mode , it was pretty loud , but the lower mode was reasonable . But the minuses definitely outweigh the pluses , that 's for sure . I 'm very disappointed in this toy and would n't recommend it to anyone .	-1
What can I say , there is no accounting for childrens ' tastes . I purchased this for my daughter and son and they only played with it for about half-an-hour before toddling and crawling off never to play with it again.There is nothing wrong with this toy . It seems rugged enough -- it is not terrible stable but does n't break when it falls over -- but they did not find it very entertaining . Son crawled off to play with giant legos and daughter went off to play with Barbie.Perhaps the problem is the lack of diversity in what the table can do . I mean after you make the banjo play a few times , how exciting is it to make it do it again . Likewise , it does not offer any opportunities to use/develop one 's imagination.For the price you might want to look elsewhere . Ours went to the neighbors twins .	-1
This toy is one of those things that is only fun for the first day or two . I bought this toy for my daughter when she was about 10 months old . The only time she played with it was when it was the only thing she could reach , while sitting on my lap . It is also chaotic -- if a button is pressed soon after another one , it interrupts what it was saying . Since kids like to bang a bunch of keys at once , the jingles end up playing just the first syllable before switching to the next one . Irritating . No off button . The ABC song is slightly different than the one most kids know , so it could be confusing -- I do n't know why they could n't stick to the original.Also -- kids in the age group may be learning to climb . This is the perfect height to try to climb onto , so WATCH THEM ; it is not very sturdy .	-1
My two year old son got tired of it very quickly . While it 's more educational than your run of the mill shopping cart , I feel that it 's a bit limited in its educational value . I guess if your child does n't already know colors and numbers then it would be more worthwhile . It 's not a good cart for pretend food shopping because there is n't much room in the cart . The worst part is that the volume is right on top by the game selection . What were they thinking ? ? We ended up putting a piece of tape over it because my son had more fun turning up the volume than he did `` shopping '' with the cart . I love Leap Frog products but this is n't one of our favorites . I think a child would have more pretend fun with an inexpensive cart and a bunch of different types of play food .	-1
We own a ton of Thomas vehicles . These battery powered ones for the wooden railway are my least favorite . First , they 're *heavy* ! That means that if they fall from the train table ( or he is playing `` Accidents Happen '' ) the HURT when they fall on your foot ( or an unsuspecting baby 's head ) . If they get thrown , they could do some serious damage . That alone is not enough to make me dislike them , because those are thing that are correctable by altering my son 's habits and play behavior . The clincher is that they just do n't work . We have the spiral mountain expansion track on our table , and none of the battery powered vehicles we have can make it up the hill unless they have a brand new *nonrechargeable* battery . On top of that , when they get `` stuck '' spinning their wheels trying to go up the hill , the rubber gripping on the bottom of the wheels starts to flake off and makes a gross mess all over the track . These are SO not worth the money when you consider that the Trackmaster trains are half the price , come in more variety , and can pull more cars behind them because they do n't couple together with only magnets . If you have a major Thomas fan , just get him the Trackmaster line if you want battery powered vehicles . These are overpriced , do n't work well , and in my opinion can be dangerous in the hands of a tantruming two year old .	-1
We have Battery Operated Thomas and Battery Operated James . Other than the color they look very similar , and , I suspect , use the same mechanics . Unfortunately , James derails very often on the same tracks that Thomas has no problem navigating . I have two tracks : a coal sifter figure 8 and the oval starter kit from Target . James derailes on each one of the tracks separately as well as on the layout I created by combining the two sets . Sometimes it 'd go around fine one time and then derail on the second run - very strange . Battery Operated Thomas almost never derails.On the positive side , my two-year old son loves these trains .	-1
Our battery operated James is defective . At first we thought that this train is different built than our other battery operated train Salty and therefore weaker . Salty operates almost perfectly , chugs up the hills and takes the turns , whereas James could not go up hills and could not pull wagons , and overall seemed much slower than Salty . Upon closer inspection and comparison with Salty ( after return period was already over ) , we discovered that for Salty 4 wheels are powering the movement ( eg. , battery makes two front wheels and two back wheels turn ) , whereas for our James only two front wheels are turning . Of course , it makes sense that this way James can not move as fast and as well as Salty . So our James is defective ... hoping that we can exchange it .	-1
This train stopped working after a week . We thought it was the battery but no . It was just a pain and ended up going to waste . Along with the money spent on it .	-1
My daughter , who is now 9 years old has wanted this ant farm for two years . I promised it to her as a condition of something she had to accomplish . I bought the ant farm at least a year ago , but only just recently ordered the ants . I looked in the packaging for information about how to get the ants . For a product that has been around since the 1950s I expect a lot more information and better customer service . I found an 800 # to call , but was put on an endless loop and finally emailed them a question about the ants . It is unclear if one has to pay for the first set of ants or not . Nobody ever responded to my email , so since it was getting late in spring here in South Texas , I decided to pony up the $ 11 ( most of that was for shipping ) and get the ants ordered before the weather was too hot to mail them.Several weeks later , and still no reply to my original email , I got an email saying that my ants were shipping and to watch for them . So I received them , and waited until my daughter went to bed . The directions said to put the vial of ants in the refrigerator for 15 minutes to get them to mellow out so they do n't give you a hard time when you put them into the ant farm . That 's great , but our ants were going crazy , and they were running all over the counter . We put them back into the tube and kept them in the fridge for another 20 minutes . The problem with trying to put the ants into the farm is this - the ant farm has a narrow , approximately 1/2 '' wide opening , and the mouth of the tube vial is round . Do n't you think after all this time they could have devised an easier way to get the ants into this frame ? The ants do n't just slide in there , they can walk up walls , so they will be fighting you as you put them into their new home that you paid for . Even in their refrigerated state , there were some ants that still did not want to cooperate . After getting the ants into the frame , we noticed that there were several ant `` parts '' , heads , legs , etc . of ants that did not make it through their journey alive . The next morning I noticed that there were even less ants alive , and this week , less than four weeks after putting the ants in there , they are all dead . I did email the company the day after receiving my ants and telling them they were mostly dead , but I just saw that this email was kicked back to me because I mistyped the address . My bad . This address is : ants @ unclemilton.com . I had just tried to look for information on their website , which is either down or the company is out of business . My advice to you is to pass this up , it is n't worth the time or effort . I read several of the reviews just now and it looks like I 'm not alone with my premature ant death . Go outside and find an ant hill to watch instead !	-1
My son loves ants so I was so excited to get him his first ant farm ! I was not aware that you had to have fat ants for this farm , so every ant my son caught crawled right up and out of the ant farm . After reading the instructions it turns out you need fat ants ? And of course you can buy them from Uncle Milton products . Obnoxious . All the ants we caught ( following directions for food and water ) were dead within 3-4 days or they escaped . Sad disappointment .	-1
This is one of those products where I have to wonder if everyone else has the same toy we have ... So , where to start ... First thing you will notice with this toy is the sounds , they are pretty terrible quality . But what is worse is the sound effects for the tractor ... which sounds like a rig . Tractors do n't beep when they back up , let alone when they are driving forward . Tractors do n't have air brakes either . The sounds from this tractor toy are taken from a rig and it makes no sense to my son who knows exactly what a tractor sounds like . You 'll notice the advertisement video cuts off right before the annoying and unrealistic beeping and air brakes kick in.After barely being used for a year , I got the toy out again for another go and found that the electronics were all messed up , the song wo n't play unless you push the sheep , press the horn , and then push down on the farmer seat ... Also 2 of the animals do n't work and the horn itself now does nothing other than work as part of the song sequence . Yes , I changed the batteries.The paint on the plastic will come off if your child chews on it , into their mouths . It will also chip off through normal play . Our farmer looks pretty poor for a toy barely used.This was a gift and I hate to say bad things about a gift , but this is the worst toy in our home .	-1
... play value is low . It takes forEVER to set it up and , IMHO , requires adult hands . The holes for the leafs are small and after the first few are inserted , it gets to be quite a challenge . Once set up , it offers less than 5 minutes of play . About the only really good thing about it is that the 2yo loves the noise the bees make as she pours them `` through '' the tree - who needs leaves ? The 6yo , however , loses interest pretty quickly . I do n't recommend this toy .	-1
Terrible set-up ! The idea is good but I am a college educated adult and I could not get all of the leaves into the tree . It was completely frustrating . The kids first tried doing it on their own , they are 5 & 7 and they could not line up the sticks to go through the holes across to the other side after the first 5 sticks were put through . I sat there for at least 10 minutes maybe more trying to get the sticks into both holes . Finally I just stuck the sticks in and did n't care if they went all the way through to the other side just to get the game started . It was very annoying for all of us . The other problem we found was turning the tree to face the person whose turn it was . Once a bunch of the sticks were taken out , each time the kids turned the tree opening towards them , the bees would fall out the bottom which upset the kids . This game was a complete failure in my house and I do not recommend it at all .	-1
Not worth it ! Takes soo long to set up , then it 's all done in two minutes . All the frustration/set up for nothing . There are way better games out there !	-1
This game takes way too much time to set-up . Poking the long , thin stems through the tiny holes takes forever ! The basic idea of this game is the opposite of what preschoolers want to do . They WANT to wake the bees and have them fall in the tray . This game is really only good for teaching basic turn taking .	-1
My 4 year old got this game from his aunt . We have tried many times to play it , since it looks cute . But each time , we pack it back up in under five minutes . It actually takes longer for us to pack it up ( or to set it up ) than to play it . The long-stemmed leaves , which are supposed to be inserted through the holes in the top of the `` tree '' have to be inserted one by one by an adult . And the bees , which are supposed to be held up by the stems , keep falling through and onto the collection cup before the game even begins . We are not very satisfied with it .	-1
I love Scrabble . My parents taught me to play when I was 12 ( many , many years ago ) and I 've loved it ever since . My husband and I bought this version of the game so we could take it on the road with us . And , it would be great except that it 's almost impossible to get the tiles into the squares . They pop out frequently when you are trying to put them in . My parents have a travel version where you can just lay the tiles in the squares . Why did they change it ?	-1
Scrabble is one of my favorite games , but I really am not impressed with the quality of this travel edition . The board refuses to lie flat , making it nearly impossible to stick letters in the rows bordering the hinges . The letters are difficult to pop into their spaces on the board . The racks , for some absurd reason , have 7 individual slots in them , so shuffling tiles is a near impossibility.This is highly unimpressive . If I want a word game when I 'm traveling , I like the Quickwords travel edition MUCH more than this . I love Scrabble , but I 'll leave it at home until they come up with a better travel edition .	-1
I believe this game 's good reviews and awards are a result of the Cranium namebrand rather than on the merits of this particular game . Our 4 1/2- and 3-year-olds played this for about three rounds before they lost interest in the `` concept '' of the game , and basically just wanted to play with the `` treasure balls . '' Even the `` advanced '' play was easy for the children , and , really , how exciting is opening the same treasure chest with the same chintzy purple jewel over and over and over again anyway ? The one good thing that I do have to say about the game is that it is not competitive but rather team work-oriented , but overall it was a waste of money . Cranium could have done better for its preschool gamers .	-1
After reading all the 5-star reviews about Zingo , I was surprised to be quite disappointed by this game . It is a variation on Bingo , but Bingo , yes Bingo , is better . In Bingo everyone who has B3 or O72 on their card gets to mark it . But in Zingo , only the fastest player who can grab the tile gets to mark the card . If you are playing with an older and younger child , the older one is almost always sure to grab it first , leading to unneeded conflicts . If an adult is playing against a child , the adult is surely to always win unless you lose the game purposefully . In the description the game claims to teach vocabulary recognition , but with words like pig , house , sun , tree , cake , bat , shoe , bird , etc. , that 's not much teaching of vocabulary for a 4-8 year old . At least in Bingo , the younger ones are learning 2-digit number recognition . After a couple of rounds my kids needed to play more than one card to keep up the interest level . After that the main attraction was the tile dispenser . That part of the game was most fun of all . Who would get to be in charge of the sliding tile dispenser ? Soon the tile dispenser was the only thing they were playing with.The thing I did like was the quality of the cards , tiles , and tile dispenser . Everything was quality made , not at all flimsy . If it did get played with , I know it would last .	-1
It 's hard to put the plastic chips into the dispenser slot . I see no need for the chip dispenser to have a cover . The play cards were warped when received , and still are . This is just another yelling and grabbing game , with matching , and little thinking .	-1
I purchased this for my kids ( 3 and 5 ) but it has been very little fun . The major problem is the joy stick . It is so stiff that even I have problems using it . The second problem is that the software is buggy . For example , unlike the original game , when you are playing Breakout the ball moves FASTER when you move the joystick . It should move at its original pace , but instead it picks up speed proportionally as you move making it almost impossible to catch up with the ball.My advice is to blow your money on something else .	-1
The pizza is too small and the toppings are too close together . Each `` slice '' has three pieces of Velcro and can theoretically hold 3 toppings , but unless they are lined up just right they wo n't fit well on the slice , and then the pizza is hard to cut . My 2.5 year old does n't really enjoy playing with this , although he enjoys making actual pizza and is always trying to get his hands on my real ( off limits ) pizza cutter . On top of the annoying fit of the toppings , it is a pain in the butt keeping track of all the pieces , especially considering they are the perfect size for his little sister to choke on . Finally , with 54 pieces of `` toppings '' you 'd think they could have included more variety . Over all , I wish I had n't bought this toy and will probably resell it .	-1
We have the old version of this toy that was given to my son as a hand me down back in 2005 or so . It has always been one of those toys that looks like a great idea but has n't gotten all that much play in our house . Right now it is in storage as I have 2yo twins and I think they might like it some day , but for now it 's just too many pieces to pick up . I keep wondering if I should just toss it - I came on here to see what other people think.It 's a neat idea - I just never saw it played with much here ! It has GOT to have a lid , though . Melissa and Doug products have really gotten worse over time - the veggie cutting box for example used to have a lid No more . The pattern blocks have no lid - I got around that by keeping the blocks in a container that fits in the frame . But it should have a lid . And this should TOTALLY have a lid - there are just too many pieces ! I would rather M & D ; charge a buck or two more ( come on - plexiglass is cheap ! ) than put out products that look like they should store well but don't.I almost want to say boycott them until they bring back lids ! : - ) Anyway overall really not that great a toy - and there 's no way I would buy it new , now , with no lid .	-1
This toy came apart in my hands before my daughter even had a chance to play with it . The dowels that are supposed to connect the train parts are not secured and I have had to glue them back in twice . This toy just feels cheaply made and I do n't feel safe letting my daughter play with it unless I have my eyes on her at all times . She 's also the kind of toddler that runs instead of walking and , therefore , falls a lot so I do n't like any toy that has hard wooden exposed pieces sticking out since she could fall on top of them pretty easily . It is now in my donate pile and will go to Goodwill soon.In my opinion , M & D ; toys have become very hit and miss recently . We have a M & D ; farm puzzle that my daughter and I both love but all of the other M & D ; toys I 've seen or purchased have not been impressive . This one definitely falls on the disappointing end of the spectrum . Spend your money elsewhere .	-1
Like the M & D pounding bench , , my son enjoyed playing with this and yes , sucking on the pegs . But my daughter wo n't be because I read that this was recalled in Canada for toxic levels of chemicals . M & D did n't bother to recall it here because the American market is full of suckers who accept lax toy standards . I 'll be replacing it with a stacking toy that is NOT MADE IN CHINA and NOT MADE BY M & D .	-1
My mother in law bought this for my son and within hours it started to fall apart . We took it back , got another one and it did the same thing . The 'pegs ' that hold the blocks and locks the train together kept falling off , which I actually found one in my sons mouth ! the glue was just not holding up.It was also a real pain because my son couldnt figure out how to stack certain blocks to make it `` look '' like a train . Small detail , but it was n't worth my trouble to deal with it anymore .	-1
This toy appears fun , until we realized that once all the pieces were taken off all that was left was a wooden platform and 2 sticks to put the pieces on . I watched and saw my daughter smack herself on the face with the sticks inches from her eye . It is also almost impossible to do once all of the pieces have been taken off . I have to rearrange to try to get the thing back together again . I do n't know how they expect a 2 or 3 year old to do it . I thought maybe it was because sometimes adults are n't always willing to let themselves think like a child so I let my 8 year old nephew do it . All of the pieces were taken off and he was pretty annoyed after a brief period of time.It 's good construction , I just would n't recommend it .	-1
We have and love Insect Lore butterfly habitat and Ladybug Land . But STAY AWAY FROM THE ANTS ! You can not release them and in two weeks they die in front of your children 's eyes . Had I know , I would never have purchased them . Yes , the kids initially were thrilled to watch them tunnel . That lasted for a few days . But as that is all they do , they both lost interest ( girl,9 and boy , 5 ) before too long . Now there are two ants left alive and the rest are little corpses in the sand . The directions even say you can watch what they do with the dead ! Yikes ! I am all for the life cycle , but this really is not acceptable . It is cruel . The children loved having release celebrations for the butterflies and ladybugs . This is just sad !	-1
I ordered this when it first came out and could hardly wait for it to arrive . The concept was so exciting , and the description was great , so I was sure my ( then ) 3-year-old would love it . I knew I 'd love for him to play a game that made exercise fun.I was disappointed right away . Instead of dancing to make music , my son had to stomp hard . I wound up limiting use to the basement rather than having to listen to him pounding on the floor of his room.On top of that , having to stomp frustrated him greatly . Several times , he wound up stomping on the toy itself . ( One of the 2 stars I gave it is due to impressive durability . ) Not surprisingly , the toy wound up in a closet and was all but forgotten until my teenager discovered it last week . Now SHE absolutely loves it -- it registers her footsteps with no problem . At least someone is getting some use out of it .	-1
Got a dud . Lights flash ( constantly ) but not a peep out of it . Has an email address , wrote for suggestions twice , also no response . But the mail was delivered so I can only assume they 're playing dead ( or playing with one that works ) ! Big let down .	-1
This toy requires the child to pump the handle in order to shoot the balls out . The only person in the house that has fun with this is my husband , as he is the only one that can use it with little effort .	-1
This is a poorly designed toy . It 's impossible to load the balls - it really require some adult pushing the balls in . And then its very difficult to release the balls - you have to pull the handle really hard . I ca n't imagine children being able to do this on their own .	-1
I am not happy that you ca n't wash them . They get dirty over time and you just have to pitch them or keep using them as is . I wish they had been easier to clean . My baby only liked the when he was in the phase where they chew on everything . For stacking , they really are n't so great .	-1
I bought this cart for my then 2 1/2y.o . daughter for Christmas 2006 . She very much enjoyed playing with it for the few months that it lasted . While it was very cute , light enough for a toddler and easy to put together , it was made of very cheap material . Without any abuse or misuse by my daughter , it bent so that it is now permanently lopsided and is no longer fun or easy to push . My daughter never tried to climb in it or overload it with heavy objects . It is simply poorly quality and not made to last . I would recommend shelling out the extra dollars for one of the more sturdy carts .	-1
i ordered this before i went to our local store and saw something very similar . the price of the item in our local store was 10 dollars cheaper and was made out of plastic . this is made out of metal and rusted about a week after we got it . we live in a very humid place so i 'm sad that i did n't consider that before i ordered this . two weeks later , the rust caused the bottom rack to fall down that my husband had to put electric tape to hold it . now i do n't know where it 's at . i think it rusted away taking the tape with it . ( it was fun while it lasted )	-1
I liked this one because it was not pink as I was purchasing it for my two sons . However , it continually falls apart and now the wheels do n't work very well . I would recommend spending a bit more money and purchasing something more durable . I wish I would have done that .	-1
Not thrilled by this game . I was hoping that it would be more challenging than it is , and it is pretty cheaply made .	-1
Game is a really great IDEA , but so POORLY made . You have to hold the pirate down to push the swords in . Kids ca n't just stick a sword in , it will tip right off the base . My son does like to play this , it 's just a pain to play . Not a favourite . I would NOT buy this again .	-1
Just got this in and it is TOTALLY CHEAP . This is .99 cents store quality with a fancy box.They 're just plastic little balls : /	-1
We received this toy as a Christmas present for our two year old who loves anything space . Whoever design/manufactured this toy should be embarrassed . It is made with the cheapest plastic possible , the planets are painted in bizarre/inaccurate colors and the pieces fall apart very easily . They glow in the dark ok but there is no way I would ever hang such a lame toy in my son 's bedroom .	-1
No one loves princesses more than my daughter , but this book did not hold her attention and interest , even with the princesses in it . That says quite a bit .	-1
this balls are so big for ball pool . and easily crushed..also smell was so strong . I will not buy again .	-1
If you are looking for crush prove balls , these are not the balls to buy . Do n't bother buying these ... they get crushed very easily !	-1
Buyer beware : this is a large bag of colorful but POORLY MADE and VERY dented balls ! The set we received had so many dents and were so misshapen that many wo n't even roll around . I thought I would give them a try despite the reviews because its so hard to find a safe set to use with kids . Very disapointing .	-1
Very disappointed . Very poor quality for the price . Wood is unfinished in places . It 's rough and just invites splinters on tiny hands . The doors do n't open and close easily . Mine actually arrived with a door that is completely stuck in place . It ca n't be slid open or closed . Had a very bad chemical odor when i opened it . Overall a very cheap product . I expected better from Melissa and Doug	-1
I do n't know how to rate this toy as Amazon/Little Tikes let us down . We ordered this kitchen well in advance for our daughters second birthday . Amazon delivered it timely but we waited till the night before her birthday to put it together . Would n't you know , half the pieces were missing ( manual , decals , hardware ... ) . This is not the first time Little Tikes sent a product with missing parts ( we have their piano which they sent without the stool ) . Beware of Little Tikes for that reason . Well we wanted to have something for our daughters birthday so we decieded to run out to ToysRUs and buy a kitchen they had available ( not our first choice but we wanted our daughter to have something ) . We wrote to Amazon and requested a refund . Not only did n't they refund us but they sent us two - yes TWO-more kitchens . I now have three huge boxes in my house and am fighting with amazon and arranging with UPS to get them out ... .Needless to say amazon wo n't refund us and the whole thing is a mess . Moral of story - an item this big you are better off buying whats available at local toy store .	-1
I was so excited when I found these blocks . I thought they were so cute and just what my son needed.When I received them many of the blocks had chucks missing around the corners and the colored lettering was chipped and fading . They are also ALOT smaller than I expected them to be.Overall this is a cheap disappointing product . I would not recommend to anyone .	-1
I bought these for my twins when they were around 2 . Right out of the package I noticed the cheap quality of them . The paint was chipped off in several spots , and the wood was slivered off in the corners on multiple blocks . I immediately put them back in the clear box they came in , and ended up throwing them away . I never even showed them to my kids because they were complete garbage ! Do n't waste your money on them . I thought Melissa and Doug was a great brand name , and that 's why I ordered them . But I do not recommend them at all . Wood and paint are cheap !	-1
I JUST RECEIVED THESE FROM AMAZON , I HAD NO IDEA HOW SMALL THEY REALLY WERE WHEN I PLACED THE ORDER . IT WAS JUST A DISAPPOINTMENT TO SEE THE ACTUAL SIZE I IMMEDIATELY WENT ONLINE AND REQUESTED AND PRINTED A RETURN LABEL . DO N'T WASTE YOUR MONEY , THESE REALLY ARE VERY SMALL . THE PLUS IS THAT THEY ARE WOOD , AND ITS SO HARD TO FIND WOOD BLOCKS IN THE STORES . BUT I WILL JUST KEEP LOOKING .	-1
I was excited to find wooden blocks for my son who loves to build towers , but why would anybody make the blocks so small ? Usually love Melissa & Doug products , but this was a disappointment .	-1
I bought these blocks because I wanted to use them for some maternity photos . I figured later down the line it would make a nice toy for my son as well . When the blocks arrived my first thought was , bummer these are quite a bit smaller than I was expecting . Upon opening the packaging my second thought was , ouch these blocks have very sharp pointy corners and upon looking at the letters I would need to spell my sons name I found that a good handful of the blocks were not as neatly painted as I had hoped . I would not buy this product again if I was given a choice .	-1
The corners on the blocks were too sharp for my twins when they were initially interested in playing with them . I was afraid they would fall over on them and cut themselves . Now that we are 2 years old , they are too small and slippery to stack with . The only part they like is talking about the pictures on them . Just not impressed and would look for a larger block if I bought some again .	-1
This toy is not a good value . My toddler received it for Christmas and has only played with it twice 10 months later . There is VERY little interaction needed for the child to do things , the toy mostly just talks at you .	-1
I purchased this toy 7 months ago . My daughter is 18 months old and is n't rough with this toy but the paint is chipping off of the rings . I expected the quality to be better . I really like the toy and my daughter loves it . I was surprised how quickly she learned to get the rings on the pole with how small the holes are , it seems like a good toy to help develop fine motor skills . This is a great classic toy I am just unhappy with the paint . Wish I would have gone with another brand .	-1
Back before I actually had a kid , when I was insisting on natural materials only , I ordered the Melissa & Doug Rainbow Stacker , even though I 'm not a fan of M & D ; toys as a rule ( I find many of them to be cheaply made ) .We got the classicFisher-Price Rock-A-Stackas a gift when Jackson was born , and I remember scoffing a little . `` Plastic ! Look at this silly thing with the ridiculous foil shiny thing inside the top ring . They could n't even make it a real rainbow , they ruined it putting those dumb little balls in the top half of the red ring . And why does it rock ? ! What kind of ridiculous popcorn-button-on-the-microwave unnecessary extra feature is that ? `` Of course , six months later , the Rock-a-Stack is the undefeated champion of playtime , and the Rainbow Stacker sits unused in the closet . Jackson loves the balls in the red ring , he likes to make it rock , he can actually get the rings off and play with them , and I do n't worry one bit when he teethes on the fat , squat , yellow ring-holder-thingy in the middle.The rings on the M & D ; stacker , on the other hand , are heavy and hard for him to lift and manipulate , the red ball rolls away ( and reminds me of a scary clown nose ) , and I 'm always worried he 's going to gag himself when he tries to chew on the tall , skinny wooden stick in the middle.The Rainbow Stacker might be a great toy for a three-year-old , but it 's not a good fit for my baby at this stage .	-1
By the time my son had played with this for a while , the paint began chipping off ! There are little chips all over each ring and the top ball . Honestly , he did n't even play with it that much . So now , I 'm tossing it out rather than handing it down to my daughter . Such a shame , but I 've found that most Melissa and Doug toys ( all made in China ! ) just do n't have the durability you would expect for the price .	-1
My 18 month old had outgrown some of his early stacker toys and really enjoys wooden toys so I thought this would be a good choice . I have to say that although I have not had any trouble with paint or color coming off of the one we bought , I would probably not bought it after reading the reviews here . That said , I have and NO problem . My son throws the pieces ( of course he does ) and even when they hit the tile floor , I have seen no cracking or chipping . The colors seem fast and do not rub off on any of hte other pieces . My son really enjoys stacking these and we are enjoying going over the colors as he plays . I will say that the red ball for the top is pretty hard for him to get on . I would absolutely buy this again and am glad I got it . I do not let my child play with it unattended or walk with the stick . I am afraid of him getting poked.As an update , two of the rings have cracked and I have thrown it away for fear of pinching little fingers .	-1
We got this stacker set with the intent to help my son start with the rings . I liked the idea that the rings were wooden and could be stacked in any order , but he wanted to put the base in his mouth . The base is a dowel rod stuck into a wooden base . If he were to put it in his mouth and fall he would be severely injured so I remove the base and we only play with the rings in a fashion similar to hockey pucks or other flat blocks .	-1
I love the Thomas the train stuff and I got this to go with the ride on train but , unfortunately , it takes an adult to pump enough air into it to make it whistle . It works fine if you can get enough air into it but I 'm pretty sure these are made for preschoolers and none of them were able to make it do anything . I even had to blow pretty hard to get it to make sound . Sometimes you get a whistle that does n't work right , so maybe it is n't the design , maybe mine just did n't work right . It looks okay and is solid wood , but as whistles go , not for young kiddos .	-1
my daughter has a few of these wooden puzzles and loves them . this one , on the other hand , falls a little short in comparison . the puzzle pieces are cheap and very thin , the knobs to grab the pieces are tiny and cheap as well . all the puzzle pieces are the same , the only difference being the color . on top of that it is only a small center section of each fish that lifts off , so on its own it is nothing , whereas some of the puzzles will have animals , so if the piece isnt on the puzzle , its a little wooden dog . this one didnt hold her interest for a minute	-1
This item was a christmas gift for my four year old boy and two year old girl they each have a cozy coupe so I thought it would be a cute addition to our backyard toy collection but to my surprise neither of them were very interested in it.I also run a home daycare and none of my students seem very excited about it either.I brought one of the cozy coupes inside along with the gas pump on a rainy day to spark new interest and still no-one seemed interested cute idea but not enough interest this is a twenty dollar dust collector in my house hopefully this is helpful to you and maybe if you do buy it your little ones will enjoy it better than mine	-1
Frustrating at first but once we were able to adjust the straps much easier .	-1
Wanted woodblocks for 2 year old , but expected pieces to be bigger . They were pretty small which made it easy for tiny hands to tip over easily after stacking . Was hoping they would have been bigger . Very vibrant colors though .	-1
These building blocks are way too small - you ca n't build much of anything with them unless you stack tons of pieces on top of each other carefully ... which is impossible for a toddler , and my assumption was that this set was meant for younger kids . A toddler ca n't do much with blocks that are 1 inch x 1 inch square . Another negative is that the blocks are super lightweight - you need some weight in a good building block in order to balance things when you 're stacking them . My son initially tried to play with these , but he quickly lost interest after every tower he built containing more than three 1-inch blocks fell over . The color is nice , but the paint has begun to chip after minimal use . I 'll be ditching this set and getting something larger and more heavy-duty . I would have expected better quality from a Melissa & Doug toy .	-1
This is a durable , quality toy . Colors are vivid and the paint endures constant falling/smashing . However , pieces are too small for any child less than 4 ; not because they can not hold it but because they do not provide adequate stability when the child tries to build something . If the pieces are not leveled perfectly , they fall apart with the slightest touch because they are too small , narrow , and LIGHT . And if your child is less than 4 years old , s/he probably will not have the patience to built up anything that falls apart constantly . Overall , toy has very good material quality , but I would go for sets with bigger pieces if the child is not 4 or older .	-1
Biggest complaints is that similarly sized blocks are not uniform in size - they vary by as much as 1-2 mm . Makes it really impossible to build stable larger structures .	-1
I bought these when my son was maybe 2 years old . He 's almost 5 now and still has not put them to much use . He does creative imaginative play with lots of other toys and misc . stuff around the house , but these blocks just end up in the box in the closet .	-1
Buyer beware ... ... . the picture is misleading . The `` Ladybug Xylophone '' is no longer included in this set .	-1
This is an overpriced toy that is a disappointment if you are looking for something musical . The ladybug xylophne makes terrible tones . The drum is just plastic . You could make the same noise with a plastic bowl . The tambourine is ok . The bells do n't have many bells on them . The clacker on the maraca does n't work nd the maraca itself does n't shake like a regular maraca . It is more like aplastic rain stick . I recommend getting $ 1.00 baby sized Maracas somewhere else . Overall , a huge disappointment .	-1
When I saw the size of the box , I was worried . I know Boots is supposed to be small , but I was expecting a firmer and better quality toy from GUND . It appears in the picture that Boots can stand , but it can not .I paid a considerable amount for this toy , plus shipping , trusting that I was receiving a GUND quality toy . That is not the case.First of all , the mouth is already pulling away from the lining , the stitching is poor and the toy actually looks dirty . If I had paid $ 7 , I would not care , but nearly $ 25 -- that 's ridiculous . And then there 's an odd suction cup hanging off the top of it 's head ! I was looking for a snuggle toy -- not a car decoration ! I will be returning this first chance I get . I could never give this as a gift .	-1
cute doll but it is really TINY . For 9 inches , that is the longest part of the toy which includes about 2 '' of sprouted hair on boots.It is really not any bigger than a beanie baby .	-1
Purchased because my daughter has a Dora doll and wanted Boots . See my review on the sucky dora dolls ! Anyhoo ... this Boots is all soft plush and expensive for what you get . He is small for size ... only a bit larger than beanie baby size and it is poorly made . Mine had loose thread strings that I had to burn off because could n't angle scissors to get to them . Also you could see the stitching on some areas and it was really done poorly . I CAN NOT sew a button on well and this looks somewhat like a crappy job that I would do ! LOL ! Within 2 days the backing separated and I had to sew it back together to prevent the stuffing from coming out ! Can you imagine what it looks like with my NOT-SO-WONDERFUL sewing skills ! My daughter is only 2 and she is happy with it ( hence the under deserved 2 stars ) so whatever ! !	-1
These Avent cups are very , very durable and put up with a lot of abuse from any overactive toddler . They 've fallen off the roof of my car , rolled down stairs , etc . without incident . The parts are interchangeable with other Avent products , which is a big plus.But they leak from time to time where the cap screws onto the bottle . There seems to be no rhyme or reason to this pattern of leakage , but having milk/juice/tea/water run down a toddler 's hands and arms is no fun to clean.And cleaning these things can be a real pain . The caps are composed of 5 parts that are nearly impossible to remove once they or your hands are wet . The tapered clear caps are especially difficult to pull off unless your hands are made of sticky tape or sandpaper .	-1
I purchased these cups for my son when he was 13 months old . I was quickly disappointed upon using them . They leaked from time to time while my son was drinking from them . As you might imagine when these cups leaked with milk or juice in them my son would quickly become a wet and sticky mess . They are also very difficult to clean . They actually break down into 5 seperate pieces which was a real pain in the neck for me . If you do not beak them down completely before cleaning them they simply just do not come out clean . I kept these cups for 3 months before I got fed up enough to throw them in the garbage . I have since purchased playtex and gerber cups both of which I recommend , they are easy to clean and no more leaks . Save your money and skip this product .	-1
I use all Avent products in my home ( bottles , pacifiers , bottle warmers , etc . ) , but I 'm not a fan of this sippie cup . The spout is shaped SO weird , it 's hard for babies to `` latch '' on to . I also do n't think the drink comes out fast enough for the babies.What I do like about these cups , though , is how you can interchange with the Avent bottles . For example , I took the sippy cup handles , and put it on the bottles when my baby was learning to hold a bottle . Or , I 'd put the sippy cup spout on a bottle . Or , I 'd put a bottle nipple on the sippy cup . The interchangeability is pretty cool , but my kids just wo n't use the sippy cup spouts .	-1
The only good thing about this sipper cup is the plastic cover . There are seven pieces in all . That means seven pieces to wash , seven pieces to sterilize , seven pieces to dry , and seven pieces to assemble . What a hassle , it 's not worth the effort . ( ... )	-1
This planetarium is just a light bulb which reflects a black shadow with barely visible names on your ceiling . It does not glow in the dark and the light is so bright that you ca n't even use it for a night light . I have nothing positive to say about this , besides the educational CD that comes with it is good .	-1
I got this at a thrift store for only $ 4.00 , and it was worth it - it is interesting and a lot of fun . I 'm glad I did n't pay full price for it , though , because it is pretty flimsey and goes through exactly 3 batteries every 24 hours.It was a gift for my 5 year old granddaughter , and she loves it , but we can not afford to keep batteries in it . Also , for it to work well you need to be in an extremely small room . We use it in our half bath because the `` stars '' do n't project well in a normal room.Not sorry I bought it , but it is n't all that great . For $ 4.00 it was worth buying and fooling around with it for a day , but there is n't much to it and by the time you pay to change batteries over and over again , you lose much of the value of it .	-1
I would not recommend this toy to anybody . Would rate 1/2 star if that were an option . It is highly disappointing . We returned ours . Even our young child was not impressed . 1 . The toy projects light , and the stars are just shadows , not the other way around . I feel this is backwards . 2 . The light is not very strong , and the constellations and words are fuzzy & difficult to see , even in a small room . 3 . The toy runs on batteries instead of electricity , and eats up batteries extremely fast ( ours may have been defective , but it only ran for a few hours on one set of fresh batteries , repeatedly ) . 4 . It was fickle . Sometimes it would turn on , and other times it would not . It would work with one set of batteries , but not another . 5 . It 's an inconvenient size and odd shape for its purpose .	-1
Looking at the picture and description , this item looks almost identical to the National Geographic Star Planetarium that I bought at a science museum . Like all the other reviewers here , I regret my purchase.A real planetarium projector is completely dark except for a few spots of light projected on the ceiling for the stars . This device is the opposite - it projects light all over the ceiling , with spots of darkness for the star . As you can imagine , that ruins the experience . For just a few cents more , they could have made the sphere dark with pinholes for the stars . At least this way , it would have made a cool nightlight.The hand-held `` meteor maker '' is just a flashlight with a couple of filters . Unfortunately , the light is so dim compared to the projector itself , that you ca n't see the image it projects.I wish I had examined the package more before purchasing it . I guess it just did n't occur to me that something designed by scientists would be so poorly made .	-1
Being new to this toy , I did n't realize that I ordered only the software . I ordered 2 types of My First LeapPad Software but no LeapPad to play it on . I live in the caribbean , so I could n't just go into a store and buy it . Whatever I ordered and did n't order that time was it , for the next 6 months -- -until my next visit to the continent . Amazon should advertise for those who do n't know while ordering for grandchildren or other children , or even into a new age group like myself , that you need the LeapPad for this . Needless to say , it stayed in its package for a very long time without use .	-1
I purchased this toy after reading 177 reviews which gave the toy an average of 3.5 stars . My kid played with the toy off and on for 3 months . the phone did n't seem special to him , he would bring it to me to press the buttons and then afterward he would grab another toy . After noticing the phone did n't work any longer I replaced the batteries . At this point the phone does n't make any sound . I have replaced 2 sets of batteries and still the toy does n't work . I would rate this as junk to any prospective buyer to beware of it .	-1
I got this for my 18 month old son because he likes toy phones and remotes . He has another sesame street remote with opening/closing eyes that he loves so I thought this would be perfect . However , this phone barely does anything and is quite boring . I decided to leave it in the package and give it away as a gift to a younger baby . When you flip it open the eyes open and it sings Elmo 's World but when you press the buttons it only says the number or object that is on that key and nothing else . It is quite boring compared to all the other phone toys he has . I should have realized that there would n't be much to it since it was so cheap but I thought I would give it a shot since his other sesame street toys are so nice . If your little one loves Elmo maybe they would really like this but I just was n't impressed by it at all .	-1
The volume is just too low . I understand why it 's low but it may as well be mute . I have another child in the home and even when both are playing relatively quietly , the phone is impossible to hear . Neither want to play with it because of this.We 're taking it back .	-1
We chose this phone over all the other ones in the store because the volume was great . Little did we know that the volume is high only for the display demo . Once you take it out of the package the volume lowers tremendously.Then the flip part of the phone did n't close shut all the way and kept popping up.We returned it the next day . Our baby did n't even have 1 whole day to enjoy it .	-1
My daughter loved this phone in the store . She loves Elmo and she loves to talk on the phone . The phone has two modes , so each button does two different things . Elmo sings part of his `` Elmo 's World '' song . We thought , `` What a great phone ! `` We get it home , take the volume control tab out ( like it said to ) , and we could hardly hear it . We were so dissapointed . Our daughter was , too . She has never really EVER played with it . She ca n't hear it ! ! They ruined a great toy !	-1
I bought this toy because I have heard parents complain that volume is too low on an item and it plain was n't . If you have a child holding a toy to it 's ear then it needs to be low but my baby just get frustrated as does my 31 yr old baby ( hubby ) . You ca n't hear anything..the worst part is when we bought it it was fine . Once you take that tag out of the back forget it .	-1
Awesome colors but the scents make me feel like puking . I far prefer the UNscented but so hard to find !	-1
These markers seem to be good but I havent let my 2 year old use 'm yet because they are rather large and with the extra big tip its probably gon na me very messy !	-1
First these are not really washable markers . They say on the packkage that they will not wash off walls or clothing . They will only wash off whiteboards or other similiar 'washable ' surfaces and skin . But worse than that is the crayons just fall apart . When you try to sharpen them they just crumble . If you peel back the paper , they just fall apart . And the colors do not show up well on the included board . This is a really bad product .	-1
This is meant for a baby/toddler toy but I do n't get why at all . I had 3 different kids under 2 play with these and none of them could really push the head down when they were all stacked up . The stickers also come off really easily and can be eaten by a small child . My daughter ate part of one . I do n't think this toy was designed well . Small hands ca n't really manipulate these .	-1
My daughter was possbily least enthused about this set of blocks out of anything that I have purchased for her . They are interesting in theory and idea , but in practice they 're a bit disappointing . They 're not super easy to stack and the different little features are not very easy for little hands manipulate . I thought perhaps that they were too old for her but at nearly a year and able to do puzzles , she 's still not interested in them ! Not my top recommendation in blocks !	-1
Neither of our children ever showed any more then a passing interest in these guys . I think partly that they are little difficult for really small children to push down on and make spin or move .	-1
My son does n't like to play with this toy much . It 's very heavy and it does n't seem to interest him . While the fishbowl is still heavy , it 's a much more fun toy for him . If you had to choose one , skip the pails and go for the fishbowl .	-1
Our daughter did n't enjoy this toy quite as much as we had hoped . She mostly played with the ball , and whenever she would carry the large HEAVY bucket , I would stress that she 'd drop it on her foot ( due to this , it 's probably better to play with this toy in the tub only ) .	-1
Okay the kids like it , but way too many parts for the little ones to loose.. so we ended up tossing most of the set as parts were lost . On the pro side , they are soft materials , and nothing to break or choke on , but even though the box is a carrying case ... do n't be fooled you will never get everything back in that box ; - )	-1
OK , I do n't know why any child would find this interesting or be motivated to play with it . Each `` puzzle '' is a piece of wood with fully colored shapes on it . The child matches the colored flat blocks to the shapes on the board . When the puzzle is completed , it looks exactly the same as before it is completed . I ca n't believe it gets such good reviews . My 3-year-old moved on halfway through the first puzzle , and I do n't blame her .	-1
Got these on sale . The pieces are rough wood . I had something similar when I was a child and they were much smoother -- nicer quality . But it was reasonably priced .	-1
I do n't know why M & D go to the trouble of packaging their products in wooden boxes without lids . I 'd much rather have a sturdy cardboard box with lids to keep everything together than a precious wooden TRAY.The quality of the board & blocks is great , and there 's shoddier out there ; but frankly , that does n't matter if you ca n't find the blocks in the first place because the child 's scattered them to the four winds during normal use .	-1
Lots of patterns , but the hard thing is that the pieces move around , so it 's difficult to get the pieces to stay in place to complete the picture . This is most frustrating for any age .	-1
while the exterior of the beads is nicely finished , the drill holes are rough and unfinished so the string catches and gets all roughed up , which makes it really annoying and difficult to string the beads up ; i will have to look for a higher quality product ; these are quite disappointing	-1
Pros : bright , beautiful colorsgreat shapes for educational purposesUntil you actually try to put the shapes on the strings and play with them ... I returned this product twice hoping that I 'd get a replacement that would prove me wrong about this product . Unfortunately , the lacing beads did not get better with a 2nd try . The insides of the beads is raw wood ( not painted ) , and even had pieces of wood sticking out from the inside . The pieces were rough feeling and had paint chipped on them . Several of the pieces were cracked in both sets I received . I do n't understand how such a popular brand can afford to make cheap , defective toys for young ones.I did not like this product and I do n't recommend it . I 'd pay a higher price for lacing beads and go with the Haba brand or something like that . Good luck !	-1
While it is `` Deluxe '' it is n't that great . It is a lot of wasted space.. I wanted something large and while it is large it 's all just empty plastic ! We ended up taking this back and buying a wood one.Cons : -The dish holder at top was awful , the plates wouldnt sit up in it.-The drawers were bad too.. not room to put stuff in the kids got frustrated and it was hard to open and close . They were constantly falling out ! ! -Spaces were small , even though the kitchen was big . Did n't really hold much but it was very bulky.I would highly recommend you look around and see some kitchens in person before spending this much on the kitchen . I much like the wood one we bought better , and the kids love it !	-1
My little girl who is now 17 and a half months old got this for her first Christmas whaen she was 8 and a half months . She chewed on it for a while when she first got it but since then has n't touched it once . It really dose n't do anything so she 's not interested in it . She likes more interactive educational toys that make noise and do things besides lay there . She 's always been that way .	-1
Cute 1st baby for a little girl . However , the rattle is heavy and can really smash a baby in the face . It only took once for me to realize that . I took the baby away from my daughter until recently . She 's a year old now so I 'm giving it another go . Also , the hair is like ... nylon or something and comes out easily . Be careful . I 'd opt ofr a baby with a built in rattle . What were they thinking making a stuffed baby with a heavy plastic rattle SEWED in to her hand ? ! Better yet , what was my Father thinking when he bought it !	-1
After all the rave reviews , I was looking forward to getting the game . It arrived today and we opened it immediately in hopes of finding it as fun as everyone says . The game is made entirely out of wood and the top cover slides in/out of grooves in the main box . We could n't get the lid to slide off easily and when it was about halfway , it made a horrific screeching sound that pierced our ears . Seriously , it was so loud I thought my ears might start bleeding ! Same thing happened when putting the lid back into place . The lid also does not fit all the way back on due to misaligment without trying to lift the inside part up some.Upon examining the game closer , it is obvious that the box and lid are not squared well , causing the fit to be slightly off . This causes the lid to rub tightly against the inside , resulting in the loud screeching and difficulty in removing it.The playing pieces also are made of wood , and the paint job on them left a lot to be desired . Yes , the game is playable but for 30 bucks , I expect higher quality and something that does n't look like a 5 year old painted it . No , I do n't expect perfection but I certainly do expect decent quality . Adding to these issues is a strong lacquer smell which is altogether unpleasant . Perhaps it would have dissipated with time , but we did n't keep the game long enough to find out.I 'm sure the game is fun so I gave it 4 stars for that along with the educational value ( for strategy ) , but the quality of the game we received was poor and unacceptable for the price .	-1
my daughter recvd this for her birthday thinking she would love to play with this in the bathtub but she hardly even touches it ! she plays with other bath toys over these . the only thing she likes to do to dora sometimes is put makeup on her face with her water crayons which wash right off , and do n't even mention boots he is just nasty , nothing but nasty slimy mold growing inside i threw him away along time ago and my daughter still has n't noticed ! I try to get her to play with the dora at the pool but she just is n't having it , I 'm surprised because she loves dora , but this just does n't do it for her .	-1
My daughter received this as a present when she was 3 months old , she now is 8 months old . She never really liked it . She would play in it for a short time but that was it . We put more interesting hanging toys on it and she seemed to like it better . I hope she likes it more when it is just a plain rocker for when she gets older . Buy something else : )	-1
I bought this as a 2nd chair , because I got sick of lugging our first bouncy seat up and down stairs . Our baby just is n't nearly as impressed by this chair as she is with the Kick and Play Bouncer seat we also have . I hope she grows to like it as she gets bigger but right now it does n't get much use .	-1
I was going to buy this one but went with another with the Deluxe take along swing also from Fisher Prize cause this one seems to be very light and can easily just tilt over or if the babies try to reach for the toys it 'll go forward with them . The Deluxe Take Along Swing do n't do that.Martha , NYC	-1
I bought this for my classroom but do n't like the tones it uses . It needs a nicer chord . Going to try to return .	-1
There is nothing good I can say about this toy . We bought it when our son was 6mths old and at 12mths he still would pick anything in the entire house before this ! Also it is dangerous ! ! ! Our son was pushing it out of his way to get to another toy and it fell forward and he fell onto it . Well he was stuck in between the wheels on the back side . Thank goodness he is always with us and we caught it immediatly . Very scary , he could not move or get out of it.It is now in the trash . Save your money and get the hungry hippo by fisher price .	-1
We bought this for our daughter when she was a year old . This is not something I would recommend for a child who is still learning to walk- here 's why : a quick re-enactment ... Daughter takes lid off toy , gets up to practice her walking skills , falls on the box part of toy and gets swollen lip . The shapes should be just a tiny bit smaller , sometimes if they 're at a slight angle it seems they do n't want to fit , very frustrating for a small child who is actually trying to put the right shape in the right hole , but it wo n't fit . We ended up buying a better made sorting toy for about $ 30 and have had no complaints .	-1
Our daughter received this and the Animal Sounds Zoo for her first birthday . The zoo gets played with several times a day and this sits on the sidelines ignored . My first complaint is that the ark comes apart into too many pieces . It is hard for a toddler to assemble it and certainly is n't portable at all . Secondly , the edges of the toy are actually quite sharp as I found out when I accidentally stepped on part of it and sliced my foot open . My one year old broke part of the roof of the ark the second time she played with it , so it 's not very durable , either . The plastic is thin and seems more brittle than other Little People sets . The best part of the set are the Little People themselves . The animals are adorable and are very well made . She carries them around with her everywhere , but they wind up at the zoo , not at the ark . We have found the Animal Sounds Zoo to be a much better toy . Our daughter plays with it many times a day and dances to the bird sound . Maybe she will like the ark when she is older , but I do n't know if it will survive that long .	-1
Please read through reviews on the 2nd and 3rd pages - lots of people have complained about the slouch ( too bad I noticed these reviews AFTER we purchased the swing : - ( We bought this swing , set it up , threw out the box , and then realized a couple of days later that the slanted back with the straps forces kids ' bodies downwards and they have no way of pushing themselves back up . How irritating , right ? ... especially since the box is gone ! Our son does n't complain about anything `` hurting , '' but then again , he does n't seem to want to stay in it for very long ( and he looooves swinging ) . It does seem to fit my 16 mo . old ( about 30 lbs . ) well . In fact , it is just his size . I know parents have had problems with some of these toddler swings being the size of infant swings - just something to watch for as you read reviews . A couple of other things about this swing that are annoying : The rope is really , really short and we could n't find one tree branch in the front or back low enough to use . We ended up having to purchase extra rope and chain , just something else for you to consider . Also , it comes affixed with 2 unremovable hooks for hanging without instructions . I am really disappointed with this swing over all , especially since it is a more expensive model and we still had to spend more money after buying it !	-1
I received this 2 days ago and upon opening the shipping box I was shocked and very upset to learn that the bed of the dump truck was missing ( kind of the purpose for the toy ) . After contacting the seller immediantly I was informed that I would get a full refund and could keep the defective toy . Curious to see how my 3 year old son reacts to a bedless dump truck for his birthday .	-1
I was so excited to get my one year old a swing , and this was just such a disappointment . It 's meant to hang from a tree branch or pre-existing swing set , which is n't mentioned anywhere in the description . We were going to put eye-hooks in our porch roof , but it actually recommends against using the hooks ( or even really the swing set for that matter ) , due to the potential for creating metal shavings . Considering how many swing sets are metal on metal , it makes me think it must be some awfully cheap not very sturdy metal that they use . Second , we tried roping it around a sturdy part of the trellis since we do n't have any trees in the desert , and it hung about 5 feet off the ground . Much too high for comfort . Then , to make matters MORE annoying , it did n't matter what we did , it would not level out . We tried adjusting the ropes behind the seat like the directions said , and they never budged . Great I supposed for peace of mind once it 's installed properly , but no amount of pushing , pulling , or maneuvering was going to get those things to move . So , it 's since been pulled back down , and will be returned as soon as the holidays are done . What a horrible disappointment.Also note , if you so much as glance at this , you 'll realize that it is NOT a dual restraint system - the tray is just a tray , easily removable , and will NOT keep your child in the swing .	-1
I bought this thinking I could attach it under our second story deck . But what the description does n't tell you is that it 's made for an existing swing set , which I do n't have . So , total waste of money for me . If I was buying a whole swing set , I would n't need this ! ! Very unhappy with this purchase . And since I ripped the card board open to find the directions and installation hardware ( which it does n't come with , because you 're supposed to already have that with your swing set ) , I ca n't return it .	-1
Evening out the ropes so that the swing moves straight is difficult and the mechanism for doing so in the back nearly broke all my nails trying to accomplish it . Definitely NOT worth the money . I 'll be returning the 2 I purchased for my twins and finding another better quality swing .	-1
Watch out for it flipping upside down . I have this swing and the Little Tikes one ( both similar design ) , and whilst the Little Tikes one seems very stable in terms of keeping the kids upright , this Fisher Price one has tipped my kids upside-down on a few occasions . When they are swung far back , if happen to lean forward just before they start coming back forward again , this is when it seems to lose balance and leave them suspended head down . Thankfully the safety straps and the tray table HAVE remained in place to hold them in . If you do buy this item , I would recommend you make sure it is mounted high enough so that they did n't hit their head if they end up swinging upside down and freaking out . Supervise . And follow Fisher Price 's caution of having it above a soft surface ( eg chipbark or something ) .	-1
does n't hold air . Great size for bigger kids but does n't stay inflated .	-1
If a product made for a child , which this one clearly is , is not sturdy enough to last more than one hour then it is nothing but a disappointment to the child and a waste of money to the person who purchased it . I had to promise to replace it to my daughter , but really I am hoping she just forgets about it .	-1
After one use this turtle has a leak that I can not find . Very expensive for just one use ! Would n't recommend .	-1
There is some great activities on this toy , but there were problems on both sides . On the first side , the only way to get the face to light up and play music is to press hard , and hold the face for a second -- what infant does that ? Also the squeaky thing is hard for even me to press . My 8 month old liked the spinning flower though , if it is the only toy around.On the older side there are much better activities . He is enjoying those more , but the pop-up feature wo n't work . It does not stay closed . If I do get it to close , just touch it and it pops up -- you are supposed to learn to press the button . I found this toy in a local baby store after buying it , and 8 of 10 had the same problem . I have n't seen a better crib activity center , so we are still keeping it ( mostly because I am not a returning type ) .	-1
this toy is not worth it there isnt much to do , the music is annoying and some stuff she cant even do its to hard	-1
I really , really wanted to love this item . The idea is fantastic -- developmental activity center that hangs down into the playpen and provides babies with stimulation and play.In reality , though , this things is useless and possibily dangerous . BE WARNED ! The first issue is that its heavy and unstable . The first time my baby swatted at it , it fell off the side and landed on him . Very frightening and unsafe.The second issue is that the little gadgets on it are FRUSTRATING . The lids do n't stay closed , the twirly things are difficult to maneauver . It requires the dexterity of a toddler , but is intended for babies.Not recommended .	-1
I see alot of good reviews on this product so maybe this just happened to my son . The toy is very fun for him to watch , and grab balls however my son has a knack for testing things it seems . I was in the kitchen while he had this toy , and I noticed when I came out he had stuck his whole arm down the tunnel trying to grab a ball , and got it stuck . He is almost two , and boys are more likely to be rough with the toys . Anyway long story short I had to use baby oil to get his arm out . I will be contacting the company before I throw the toy out . Other than that the blue slide was constantly being taken off by my son . I rated five stars for fun because he had more attention on this than anything else for awhile .	-1
The balls go flying out of the machine all over the floor . Usually , they do NOT return into the machine and pop back out . It was not fun chasing the balls everywhere . The motor is SO loud that you can barely hear the music ! It scares my 8 month old but my 8 year old neice loves it ! Glad it was on clearance at Wally World .	-1
I thought this looked like so much fun , but I 'm really disappointed . When the balls pop out they either come back down on the edge of where they came out and fly across the room or , as they come down , another ball is coming out and they hit each other and both fly across the room . Within five seconds , every ball is out of the ball popper and the baby is left there waiting for something to happen . When he realized the show is over , he crawls off unamused .	-1
This thing honestly gives me an anxiety attack every time it 's on ! Between the spastic music and the balls flying everywhere , it gets quite intimidating . My son likes it for about 2 minutes and also gets irritated with all the balls flying uncontrollably everywhere . When I purchased this , I thought the balls were a little more controlled , maybe just popped up in the air a little and back down into the funnel thing , but NO ! They go EVERYWHERE ! All over the room ! You spend more time chasing than you do watching . We finally put him and the toy in one big box , just to control the balls , and he liked that better . Ugh , I wish I would n't have bought it ...	-1
I see alot of good reviews for this toy , but that just has n't been the experience for us . Our daughter has always been a bit sensitive to noises . She 's terrified of the vacuum , electric hand driers , and this toy makes a very similar noise . She was frightened of it at 12 months , and at 22 months nothing 's changed ... in fact just the sight of the toy sends her running to the other side of the room . Otherwise it looks like a fun toy , it 's just maybe not for everyone .	-1
I bought this toy for my daughter when she was just learning to sit up as an incentive to learn to maintain a sitting position for a while.The good : -- my daughter loved it ! It was fun and kept her attention for 15 minutes or so ( at a young age , that is quite a feat ! ) The bad : -- the balls really pop out of this thing and if have hard floors , they will go bouncing and rolling around . Plan on spending a lot of time chasing after them if you child can't/wo n't get them herself. -- there is no good way to dislodge things that get stuck in this toy . Like most kids , my daughter thought it would be *super* to see what else would fit down the hole and I spend a good amount of time trying to dislodge a cotton ball from the inner workings. -- this is not the quietest toy in the world . While the toy is n't designed to make `` fun '' noises , the fan motor is fairly loud. -- the fan motor gave out after a few months .	-1
I have passed by this toy countless times in the isles of Wal-mart , but never felt the need to purchase it . Well , my 10 month old son received it for Christmas and it 's fast become my least favorite toy . There is no volume control , which is a huge bummer since this plays extremely loud music , and the fan that pushes the balls up sounds like a blow dryer . Very loud.The worst thing though is the balls pop up so hard and fast that they fly all over the place . My son seems to enjoy the balls popping up and cycling through the toy , but I have to sit there with it and keep my hand over the top to prevent the balls from flying all over , otherwise , they go everywhere and he just loses interest . We have light carpeting and they still manage to roll under furniture or across the room.In the end , I 'd say avoid this . It 's definitely not worth the trouble . Way too noisy and too much work . I think I 'm gon na put it away till he 's a bit older , and can chase after the balls himself . I 'm just thankful I listened to my gut and did n't spend my own money on this colossal pain-in-the-rear !	-1
First of all , if you loose the balls you ca n't buy replacement balls . If the cheep plastic balls get smashed they wont go threw the tunnel any more . The thing keeps falling apart ! The top always comes off . And my biggest gripe , boy does this thing suck batteries ! ! ! You may as well take them to Chucky Cheese for all the money you will spend on battteries . Get the Fisher Price Giraffe ball toy instead , way better !	-1
Well ... I almost do n't know what to say . This toy gets pretty solid reviews , which I rely on when I am purchasing . I have a 1 year old and a 3 year old . This was purchased for the one year old for his birthday , with the thought , as we do with many purchases , that both would enjoy it on some level . The first one did not work at all , fan was broken . Second one works ok , but many times the fan is not strong enough and the balls get stalled blowing only at the height of the opening they are supposed to come out of . But , often it works well enough that if that were the only issue , it would be a worthwhile toy . Now , that being said , I personally find the toy extremely annoying even when it is working right , because the balls do NOT stay in the toy even remotely on a regular basis , they fly out consistently and have to be out back in . Since the toy is not for me , and the kids giggle and put them back in , even that is ok , even though the balls spend a lot of time being lost . My major issue is that my 2 boys , absolutely refuse to quit putting things that do not belong in the toy down the holes the balls are supposed to go in . Though I did not read all 500 reviews , I can not believe that I am the only parent that has had this issue . We have a bent clothes hanger that we keep on-hand just for unclogging this toy . I also consider my boys to be fairly normal , and they play with other toys just fine , they way they are supposed to be played with . As a result , this toy spends a lot of time being out of commission . Although we spend a lot of time playing with our boys and their toys , we also encourage a lot of independent playtime . When we do play together , we color or use Play Doh or play a game with rules and pieces that have to be monitored , and this toy was purchased with the thought that they would play with it on their own . The only way it functions as intended ( without lost balls and clogged ducts ) is if we supervise . Therefore , it does not fulfill it 's purpose in our home and I would not purchase it again . I would recommend knowing what your goals are for this toy before you decide to buy it .	-1
I must admit , my daughter really likes this toy ... when it 's working correctly ! Most of the time , the balls just fly out of the toy , never to be seen again until I go searching under furniture for them . I do feel as if I 'm `` fetching '' these balls for my daughter over and over again . If I do n't , she gets frustrated because the toy does n't do anything ! I love Playskool toys , but I really feel like they missed the mark with this one !	-1
I got this for my 2 year old . Both he and his 4 year old brother found it entertaining . It is also good practice for little ones to place an object into a small hole ( fine motor skills ) . Problems with it though : my 2 year old , who still chews on things . promptly destroyed all the balls . This toy is intended for babies and babies mouth their toys , so I think the balls should have been able to handle it . This toy is also loud without volume control . Heads up -- takes 4 D batteries that are n't included .	-1
The concept behind this toy is great , but the engineering/design is not . Looking at the picture here , I believe they may have redesigned since we got our son one 6 months ago as the chute attaches differently as pictured . Perhaps this works better because the chute is constantly coming apart on ours . We 've also had the problem of the balls getting stuck or just kind of swaying back and forth . The music is HORRIBLY loud . We have to turn it off if we 're trying to watch TV and son is playing in the room . Many musical toys have at least a low and high volume switch . This one desperately needs one ! ! On the positive , our son does love to watch the balls and grab at them as they pop out or go down the chute . He will chase the balls when they go flying . He 's not quite old enough to know how to put them back in the toy once they are out , but he 'll get there . He 'd probably play with it a lot more had I more tolerance for the music !	-1
I bought this popper for my 8 1/2 month old , thinking he would love the popping balls . It probably would have been okay , but the vacuum sound scared him silly ! As soon as I pushed the red plunger and the vacuum started , he cried hysterically . I even tried it a few times , just to see if he would get used to it , but no luck . I might have kept the product until he was older to see if he liked it then , but whenever I turned it on , the balls kept popping out and it was very annoying . I could see losing the balls within a few days as well as the cats getting ahold of them . Good idea , but fix the sound issues and the balls popping out !	-1
My son requested this for Christmas of 2003 . We purchased it from amazon and put it away for christmas since christmas was still a few months away . Christmas morning I could n't belive when we took it out of the box and pieces were missing . We did n't even get the right feet . Literally ! Our game came with two left feet not a right foot . There was n't enough pieces to get him put together correctly so we figured we would put batteries in it just to see what the game sounded like . Surprise the game did n't even turn on . What a piece of junk . My son really wanted another one , but we explained the value ( ... ) and that he would be better off trying a different toy .	-1
I thought this toy would make a cute gift from Santa so I added it to the pile . My 2 & 3 year old loved the whole concept but the toy is poorly constructed and constantly falling apart . I finally made it `` disappear '' and left them with the ball to play with . This toy needs to be revamped and made as one piece or better construction . Great idea but someone fell asleep during the tryout phase on this one .	-1
I bought this toy for my three year old and for my three daycare children.We played it the first day and it worked great and they absolutely loved it.However , and this is the bad thing , unless you are willing to put out the money for new batteries each and every time you use it , then do n't buy it . The batteries seem wear down after just a half hour of use . I would recomend rechargeable batteries for this toy . I was very disapointed .	-1
I bought this toy for my daughter who stated it was the only thing she wanted for her birthday . It was fun the two times that we played , but on the third time , the motor would n't start . I payed almost 20.00 for the game and 7.00 for new batteries for it . It was definately the shortest amount of fun I have ever paid 27.00 for , and my daughter was sorely disappointed . This toy is junk .	-1
Do NOT buy this game ! My daughter received one and another member of my family received one and it is the worst toy received since my daughter 's birth 4 years ago . The fan is not even powerful enough to inflate the trunk let alone blow anything out of it ! This is with new batteries too . You have to open up the trunk and wait for one butterfly to come out then wait two more minutes for another . The picture on the box is very deceiving .	-1
Elefun is a simple game that requires no special setup and no special strategy . It is a somewhat physical game involving the catching of butterflies in a small net . These vinyl butterflies are placed in the base , the trunk is attached , the motor is turned on , and the butterflies slowly release from Elefun . The person who catches the most is the winner . It is a game that can be learned instantly and can be used to provide some quick entertainment when children are getting restless.Elefun offers some good points that make it a hit with most children ; namely the action factor , which encourages children to physically compete as they scramble with their nets in hand , trying to catch as many butterflies as possible to win the game . But other than this , Elefun is n't as much fun as its name suggests . First , the action factor is actually a little on the slow side . I can agree that a gradual release of the butterflies from Elefun 's trunk is a good idea , but the problem is the amount of time it takes for the trunk to expand and the slowness of the release of the vinyl butterflies . The motor is too weak to get the game going and some children will grow impatient having to wait.Another problem with Elefun is its tendency to eat up batteries . The game takes four batteries and they die quickly , mainly because the game is very brief and most children will want to play it again and again . If this happens , the batteries are not likely to last more than a few days . It is a little puzzling that four batteries would produce so little power and also die out so quickly , but this is exactly what happens . Then , there is the problem with the butterflies themselves . There are thirty of them , but no matter how they are placed in the base , Elefun does n't release them all . There are always a few butterflies left , stuck in the base . Their small size makes them easy to lose , too.Kids like action- oriented games and most children will like Elefun at first . But once they are forced to stand around , waiting for the butterflies to release and once they realize how quickly the batteries fail , they will grow frustrated with this game and push it aside in favor of more reliable entertainment . It could be improved with a few simple changes , but until that happens , do n't waste your time or money on Elefun .	-1
This is the kind of toy I 'd wish I 'd gotten a smoking deal on . It 's not the worst game we have in the closet , but it was n't worth the $ 25 we paid for it.For starters , the butterflies do not fly very well once outside of the elephants trunk . The fan does n't blow very well , so there is n't much extra help to get those butterflies going , either . The butterflies just come out of the trunk and drop . So the kids just stand there - not like on the tv commercial ... Also , depending on the age of your children , they 're either going to be too good or not ready for the game . I have 4 kids plus their friends . And we 've found that there is n't a lot of middle ground . Either they 're great at this , or they have a lot to learn about catching butterflies ... So having the good kids and the bad kids play together causes problems . Beware of this.Anyway - if you read this review before buying , only buy this game if it 's a super good deal ( or your child is dying to have it ) It 's not worth the full price .	-1
Do n't waste your time or money ! ! ! ! My 3 year old recieved this for christmas . I used brand new batteries , alkaline like they recommended . The following two reviews are a joke ( does milton bradley pay people to write good reviews ? ? ? ? ? ) . When you turn elefun on a few butterflies come out after about 30 seconds then we waited , like the instructions say , another 30 seconds , another butterfly , about 20 seconds later 1 more and about another 30 seconds later 1 more and that was it . We waited and waited . I tried to shut it off and start over again . we waited about 3 minutes , ( mixed up the butterflies as what the instructions said if butterflies do n't come out ) and nothing came out , I tapped the side and 1 butterfly came out ... woo hoo . Then we tried it again a little later and no go . It kept blowing and nothing came out . F- rating 0	-1
I was so excited to buy this for my three year old daughter . I figured it would reinforce counting and colors as well as eye hand coordination . When we started playing , the butterflies took forever to shoot out . I opened it and mixed them around as the instructions stated but still only one or two popped out . The rest kept blowing around on the bottom . Very disappointing . After a while my daughter said `` all done Mommy '' . She was bored standing there waiting for the butterflies . I dont blame her , I was bored myself . The fan worked fine and the trunk fully extended & I put fresh batteries so Im not really sure what went wrong . Its such a nice idea but Im sad to say its a lemon of a game .	-1
We bought this toy for our two and three year old . The trunk would not go up and becuase of that the butterflys would not do the same . We returned it the same day .	-1
The first time you run this game , it 's a big hit . It takes a minute or less ( usually closer to 45 seconds ) for all of the butterflies to come out of the trunk . I 've tried all kinds of methods to make this last longer but nothing works.Then you need to gather up the butterflies that were n't caught and get them out of the nets , reload the game & start again . It takes a while to get the game set up again and by that point , since the fun is so short-lived , I 've found that the kids do n't want to play it anymore.This game could be improved by having some kind of stop-start option that would allow the butterflies to come out in a more staggered manner if you wanted . I would also like to be able to purchase refill butterflies , since they have a tendency to stick to other things and get lost . I guess I 'll try to make something instead , as we have few butterflies left.Three of the nets have broken . The kids have used them as hats and as toys outside the realm of the Elephun game . the fabric of the nets is fine but the hoops have broken at the point where they would hook together . The kids have as much fun catching the butterflies with their hands ( and it seems to be easier than using the nets ) .The elephant itself is very durable and my kids had more fun using it to store other things , like sticking cards , checkers and small plush toys down the trunk . They were disappointed when the elephant did n't blast these out ; )	-1
This is the old standard in inexpensive gates . However , they do n't make these the same way they used to . The expansion rod had been bolted directly against the frame on both halves of the gate . Now , however , there is an extension where it is bolted to the recessed half so that the expansion rod lines up straight along the length of the gate . While it appears that this would improve the function of the gate , my own experience is that it makes the gate more flimsy and more difficult to line up in the doorway . The older design works much better and I feel that the newer design decreases the safety function expected of the this gate . Also , any gate with a crosshatch design like this one is climbable . To its benefit , this gate does not swing open and is more difficult for kids to remove than gates that do - most kids are pretty good at figuring out the mechanism on gates that open . NEVER USE A PRESSURE MOUNTED GATE AT THE TOP OF STAIRS . A stairway gate should be very sturdy and should require installation .	-1
This is the worst gate I have ever seen ! We bought it 2 weeks ago to help our dog learn that the baby 's room was off limits . Well , I lifted the lever to release the gate today and it broke ! The notch that we set it at broke out and shot across the room . Plus it was hard to use from the beginning ! The directions are vague at best and the arm that locks it was almost impossible for me to get locked into place . It kept shifting the gate off center or bowing to where it would n't lock . My husband had to set it up most of the time . Once it was up , it was flimsy at best . It would fall under the smallest amount of pressure ... like the pressure exerted when a child pulls up on something . I know it is one of the cheaper gates marketed , but come on ! There is no way that I would depend on this thing when it can to the saftey of my child !	-1
Skip buying this bubble bucket . The wands are way too big , soap gets everywhere , and it really just makes a huge mess . Maybe it wo n't spill but what about the soap on the wands getting all over the floor . I have already thrown it away .	-1
My son recieved this chair as a birthday gift . We already owned a similar chair but this one seemed so much nicer . We were thrilled to recieve it until we actually used it . It is very difficult to clean . Food gets trapped in the little holed and even when we shake it out some food remains trapped . My husband takes it outside and runs the hose through the little holes near the straps and that usually does the trick . After he hoses it out we leave it in the garage overnight to dry . Keep in mind that if you purchase this chair this is a every night routine that you can look forward to . Prior to recieving this chair we were using a Fisher Price chair that was not nearly as attractive . We bought it for 10.00 at Kmart . The 10.00 Kmart chair actually comes apart and can be put in the dishwasher which makes cleaning up as easy as can be . As for this chair do not waste your money . More expensive is not always better and this chair is proof of that .	-1
This was really a great chair while my son was on stage 1 and 2 foods . We havea small eating area in our kitchen so it was perfect for space saving purposes . However , once my little mister started finger foods , I could n't stand it ! The safety belt is attached so that there are two openings on either side of the baby 's bum and everything that falls down slides right into the slots . I have tried vacuuming the pieces of food out , shaking them out , and picking them out . Some food comes out however most stays in the base . The only was to get all the food out would be to remove the base . This is difficult to do . I ended up buying a small highchair ( Jmason ) for the same cost and it has a padded seat ! My son seems to enjoy the high chair more than the unpadded booster . By the way , the booster comes with two & quot ; toys & quot ; to set in depressions on either side of the tray . This is a problem for two reasons ; ( 1 ) they are too difficult for a 4 month old to depress ( let alone a two year old ) and in my opinion , eating is not play time .	-1
When this came in the mail , we opened it almost immediately and found completely dried out paints that were unusable . We tried mixing them with water and nothing . All in all , it was cheap and I would n't recommend .	-1
I did n't like it . Really involved and I did n't realize at the time of purchase it was so . But the kit itself was cool , I just did n't have the patience for it .	-1
We usually love all things Melissa & Doug , but this was a flop in our house . The pieces are so oddly shaped , there are some huge pieces and a few super tiny . Most of the pieces are for the barn , which is pretty boring . We love the Underwater floor puzzle and the alphabet train puzzle , but this one is a huge miss in our house . Our kids do n't want to play with it and it just sits in the game closet . Pretty disappointed .	-1
I have fond memories of barreling down a hill in my radio flier , wrecking it , and dragging it back up the hill to do it all over again . The wagon I had was the town and country and it has been used and abused . I am now 30 and my parents still use the wagon to haul stuff around it works great . I bought this wagon expecting the same great experience and was dissapointed . It seems very durable and I like the seats with the seatbelts ( primarially the reason I bought it ) . My main complaint is with the front wheels . I understand that you cant steer it while sitting in the wagon but the wheels when I am pulling my son dont track straight & they just begin wobbling thus shaking the wagon . This is a major shortcoming in my opinion and is a significant design flaw ( which earned this product the low rating ) . We will be getting one of the other wagons that have traditional wheels and axles and I would suggest that anyone reading this review do the same .	-1
Our 4 yr old got this wagon this Christmas ( 2012 ) & I wish we 'd gone a different route . With a name like Radio Flyer , I expect high quality , but someone missed the boat with this design . Yes , the high back seats , seat belts , cup holders , long handle are all awesome features . BUT all those great features do n't matter when it 's such a pain to use.Pulling the wagon in a straight line is great , as long as that 's the ONLY direction you want to go . Trying to turn the wheels , at all , even a tiny bit , is a pain . The handle is attached to the wagon , not the wheels , so there 's no `` give '' when turning . The wheels we have to kick in the direction we want to turn , in order for them to move that way . They also make this horrible screeching noise when turning . Even going straight they make the screeching noise . Our son is mildly autistic and the screeching noise really bothers his ears . It is really , really loud.We 've used this wagon only a handful of times in the 3 mos we 've had it & today at the park , we discovered one back wheel is already coming apart . The tire is coming off and when we tried to snap it back on , the hubcap seems really flimsy , like if we push too hard it 's going to crack & break completely .	-1
Cute , but the pins are hard to get to stand up . My 3 year old has a hard time getting them to stand and gets very frustrated . They are still cute toys but not as intended .	-1
This is a sloppy toy . Not a lot of fun , hard to set up , and they do n't stay up too well . I cant think of a reason to buy this thing .	-1
My two year old does not have any interest in this toy yet . She will shake the cows sometimes as they rattle and toss them down the stairs , but that is the most she will do with it . She did get a lot of other toys , so over time her interest may increase , but so far , this is not something that appeals to her . We may have to take her bowling one day to see the whole purpose of it .	-1
I bought this toy for my son when he was about 14 months . He never touched and those bowling pins doesnt stand well.. no matter how hard i tried to make them stand .. they fell . Also , packing cover was ripped open with in a month after i bought the toy . there are better product in the market for less price .	-1
It is a cute toy and our baby likes the ball and the bowling pins , but he likes them as separate toys . As a bowling game toy it does not work very well .	-1
My children really enjoyed this toy but I really did n't think it was all that great . The only thing they enjoyed about it was the ball . They threw it around a lot.I could n't get the animals to stand up right , EVER . It is not educational besides the pins are animals . Since the pins do n't stand up though the kids do n't really pay attention to them.I ended up giving this toy away to someone who had a baby . I thought maybe it would be better for a baby who is learning how to hold things since the game part just does n't work .	-1
After reading such favorable reviews I bought this bowling set for my son 's first birthday . We 've had the toy now for a month and he is not very interested in it . If I set it up for him he will toss the ball at the pins a couple of times and then look at a couple of animal/pins and then he is done . I do n't much care if he bowls with it , but he does n't pick it up or ask for any of the pieces either.While the toy is cute , something not played with is money wasted . The toy seems well made and probably durable but without a child to love it , I just ca n't recommend it .	-1
This toy must be one of those 'hit or miss ' type things . My sons were not impressed at all - got on once or twice , and then left the poor blue puppy abadoned in the corner until I sold it on Craigslist . LOL .	-1
I thought this would be a good way to store the many puzzles I have for my grandchildren , but ended up donating it to a daycare nearby . Most of the puzzles I had did not fit it . Apparently only Melissa & Doug puzzles are sure to fit it .	-1
I 'm not sure what size puzzles this was actually made for but it does n't even hold half of ours . Yes , they are Melissa and Doug brand , and no , most of them are not chunky . It 's useless to us and I 'm so disappointed with this product . In order to get even a few to work in this we had to put them in all cock- eyed . You 're better off just storing your puzzles in some sort of box or plastic storage bin . Do n't waste your money on this !	-1
I think this was the biggest WASTE of money . I do n't know what kind of & # 34 ; standard & # 34 ; puzzle size they were talking about . I have numerous unisized wooden Melissa & Doug puzzles and THEY DO NOT STACK AT ALL LIKE PICTURED . I 'm MIFFED . Maybe the puzzles are standard and they sent me the wrong thing . Although somewhat pricey for what it is , I thought it would bring order to my playroom and it certainly does not ! Nevertheless , it 's not worth further emotions to investigate or return . JUST STATE THE DIMENSIONS as in & # 34 ; fits puzzles A & # 34 ; by B & # 34 ; . Standard my arse .	-1
Not a fan at all ... .I have a boatload of Melissa and Doug puzzles and thought this would be great ... .half of them do not fit properly and it tips over easily . I was hoping to attach it to a wall at some point and maybe it would work better .	-1
We got this for our 9 year old son after seeing the 5-star rating and reading some reviews . But I can not figure out why it is rated so highly . He played with it very briefly and was not captivated at . all . He loves building things out of legos , marble towers . knex , you name it , but this was just not an exciting toy . You copy the diagram for the set-up , and a little light bulb comes on ( that 's fun for about 2 minutes ) . The helicopter set-up seemed promising , but it would not work properly ( at least we could n't figure it out , and my husband has some electrical experience ) . I realize this review will not outweigh the hundreds of 5-star reviews , but this was a big let-down for us .	-1
Did I get it wrong ? End of the song Elmo says `` Elmo 's pooped '' . Yes I understand what that means , but it is totally not proper words for younger kids to learn . I do n't like it . Other than that , it works good . No problem at all .	-1
Do n't waste your money ... the kids find it funny for the first day..then it ends up at the bottom of the toy box never to be touched again .	-1
Thought this would be a huge hit ... not so much fun as they make it sound . Kids find it a bit dry , easy and boring -- - and parents will dread this game . Save yourself now -- do n't buy it .	-1
Honestly , my kids ( 2.5 and 6.5 years ) loved this the first two times they played it . After that , the thrill was gone . My daughter kept asking `` what else can we do ? '' because it 's the same directions over and over . And , even with just two kids , the voice is n't loud enough that we could hear it . I ca n't imagine tryin gto hear it over a group of children . This game is SO not worth $ 25 . A game of `` simon says '' is free and a whole lot more fun and creative . The educational value of this game is pretty low . I do n't think a parent needs to pay $ 25 for a child to learn basic shapes and colors and to recognize a handful of animals , instruments , and food . For the life of me , I ca n't see why this game got so many great reviews . I will say that the construction of the game is decent and the marketig/packaging are top notch . The game itself , however , is quite dull even to a toddler . Simon says : '' Save your money ! ''	-1
After only a few days the mats started to curl up . We kept using them for awhile anyway , but it was n't long before we had to pitch them . No mats = no game . I guess I could try to make my own to replace them.The command voice is way too quiet . He 's also much too quick to jump to the next command , which makes playing nearly impossibly for littler kids , and it will be too boring/easy for most older kids . It does n't give them enough time to process the command before it 's off to the next thing . If they do n't know it pat , they miss out on that command.I did find that it got repetitive awfully quickly . Every once in awhile I 'd hear an unusual command that we had n't heard before ( like `` spin to a vegetable '' ) which mixed it up a little and made it more fun , but not often . Overall not worth a purchase .	-1
I bought this game along with several other games that our whole family could play ( kids ages 6-12 ) . I was looking for games that were fun , and gave younger kids a chance to win as much as older kids/adults . The set up was frustrating . It was very hard to keep the game balanced to get all the pieces on . It took 2 adults . I could not have set this up alone ( and I consider myself having good motor skills ) . My 6 year old had alot of trouble with this game , a hard time getting the `` fork tool '' under the pieces . After playing the game twice it was not a game that made family fun night fun . We wo n't keep this game in our regular rotation . I bought games like kerplunk , scavenger hunt , hungry hippos , and tumblin monkeys that work alot better for our families age range . I can see the value in the game for working with kids with fine motor skills issues .	-1
This game is fun , but yet the only reason I bought it was because it was VERY cheap for Black Friday sale online . It 's really TOO easy to tip it over , and as an adult I could n't even play 2 turns before it would tip over so easily . My 7 year old son got so frustrated with being unable to get any turns in as it would tip over , he does n't even want to play it anymore . Too challenging for even an adult .	-1
I bought this for my wife to play with my grandson ... this was one of her favorites as a child ( and mine , too ) . How disappointed we were to see how much the game had shrunk since our youth . The decreased size made the game much harder ( even with our steadier 'adult ' hands , and almost impossible for our ( then ) 8-year old grandchild . To add insult to injury , the 'little man ' on the perch has been replaced by a nondescript pointy-shaped object . I should n't be surprised , a lot of the children 's classics that are being reprinted now are horrendously cheap imitations of what they once were . No wonder so many young people prefer video games ! SHAME ON YOU , MATTEL ! ! !	-1
My daughter loves The Wiggles ! She received the guitar as a gift for Chanukah & played with it endlessly for a few weeks . Now it 's sitting in her toy box , & she has n't touched it in months . The buttons that you press play a portion of the characters ' own songs . ( i.e. , Dorothy the Dinosaur - Romp Bomp A Chomp ) It does n't do more than that.I like The Wiggles . They teach manners , health , colors , numbers , etc . The toy just is n't worth the money . I expected better than I got .	-1
We bought this for our son for christmas since he loves trains so much . I have to say that i wish we would of done alot more research into this before we bought it . Our son is almost 3 and he is absolutely heartbroken over this train . The depot does not stay attatched very well , the bridge can only be used in one track design , the actual bridge does not seem to fit very well over the two tunnel pieces and causes the train to come off of the track , and in the accessories , you can not make the train run through the fire station and it gets frustrating trying to watch him put this together himself , which he is unable to do . This train eats the batteries , we have only had this out for a little over four days and we have already had to replace the batteries TWICE ! The train jumps the track and there is really nothing that a little one can do with this . This set is better suited to a 5 year old , who likes to run the train around a track and at the same time , push other pieces in pretend play . I am very disapointed fisher price !	-1
We 've always had great things to say about the Geotrax toys , and since our 3-year old son loves fire trucks , this one seemed like a no-brainer . Unfortunately , it 's the weakest Geotrax add-on we own.There are two problems with the Rescue Station . First , as the previous review mentioned , it does not fasten very securely to its own section of track . One of the greatest characteristics of the Geotrax system is that once they 're snapped together , pieces stay in place through a lot of playing and jostling . However , the Rescue Station is the only exception that we 've found thus far . It barely clicks into place at all and comes undone if you move the track even the slightest bit.Second , it does n't `` do '' much at all . It has no GeoMotion capability , i.e . there 's no automated task that occurs when the train goes by . Your child can manually crank the turntable to open the firehouse door , but the station is basically just additional scenery . The fire engine cars that are included are not motorized and only one of them is designed to hook into an existing train . So , expect one of them to sit in the fire house garage for a long time to come.On the positive side , it is well-constructed and durable just as every GeoTrax set is . And for a while , it may interest kids who really love fire trucks . However , eventually it will pale in comparison to everything else going on in your child 's GeoTrax train system .	-1
On Christma my daughter was overjoyed with the toy pushing it all over the house while everyone laughed . now she has discovered if she just sits on it it 'll talk . Big waste of money for me .	-1
This is a cute toy and our daughter loved it but ... something is severely wrong with the voice mechanism . It has a muffled voice sound and often sounds gargled and demonic ! We have replaced the batteries several times thinking this was the problem but it does the same thing once you replace the batteries out for new ones . Our daughter did enjoy playing with this toy but she often gets annoyed because the handle falls off easily and the voice mechanism does n't work well or sounds posessed and this freightens her ! I 'd probably recommend a different vacuum cleaner and would n't re-purchase this one again if I had the option .	-1
Was given this as a gift . Was really excited because my girls love the kitchen toys but have never had a register . They loved it ... until they got the coins jammed right away . I got the coins out with a knife but then my 5 year old broght it to me saying it was n't recongnizing her coins right . Sure enough , you put in a dime it says it is a penny , or a quarter , or a nickle , or sometimes the dime is actually a dime . It would do this with all the coins . Must have been a manufacture defect that it does n't recongnize the coins right , but obviously I ca n't let my kids play with a toy that has NEGATIVE education value ( makes them dumber for playing with it ! ) what a shame to put the leapfrog name on .	-1
My daughter had a cash register which was cheap , did n't have a ringing sound and broke fairly quickly , so I decided to get her this one last Christmas , because it was made by Leapfrog and seemed to be durable and came with counting games . What a mistake ! The only plus is that it 's durable . I mean , that 's the ONLY plus . Here 's all the minuses:1 . The coins jam extremely easily . Luckily , there 's a little access slot to unjam the coins . When my daughter played with it the first two times , we put the cover for the slot back on . The third time she played with it ( and the third time it jammed ) we threw the cover away , since we realized that every time she plays with it it was going to jam . And it does ! My daughter likes putting the coins in very quickly and doing that it 's easy for them to get stuck . It takes a butter knife or a screw driver to unstick them . I told her not to put the coins in too quickly , but she still does , and of course they jam again and again . To say I 'm sick of unjamming these coins every thirty seconds is an understatement.2 . It 's extremely loud . Now , I have a very high tolerance for loud toys . I grew up in a household where the TV was always on at full volume and everybody was always screaming at each other , so what others consider to be 'loud ' toys , seem very reasonable to me . So , take it from me ... when I say this thing is extremely loud , for most people it would be unbearably , blow your eardrums off loud . I would not be surprised if this thing registered a hundred decibels or more with one of those sound meter things . Luckily , there is a volume control , but unfortunately when the cash register is first turned on , it 's on the highest volume setting . You have to click the volume button about fourteen times to get it to a reasonable setting ( again , which to most people would still be considered loud ) . At first , I thought my daughter was turning it up on purpose and yelled at her , thinking no toy company in their right mind would have the setting naturally that loud . I felt like a total jerk when I realized that she was n't doing it , and that Leapfrog was n't in their right mind when the set the volume for this product . If I had tried it out in a store and saw it was this noisy , I would have never bought it for her . So , besides unjamming the coin slot every time , you also have to turn it down every time . ( Do n't expect your kid to do this -- my daughter does n't mind the rock concert volume at all . ) This is a huge minus for any parent who is not deaf and would like to stay that way.3 . My daughter does n't like the games . My daughter at first played the games , but she got sick of them very quickly . I think it 's because they 're a little too complicated for the age range , and like others have said , the games have too much talking and not enough action . There also is n't a setting where the toy would function like a regular cash register . When my daughter does play with it nowadays , it 's usually with the toy turned off.4 . There 's nowhere to store the price tags . Though the coins are large , and they all fit in the till , the price tags are too big to go in there too and with a toddler , that means a higher chance of misplacing them . I like to have all the small parts accessible to my daughter so she does n't have to dig through the toybox looking for them , but unfortunately , we 're constantly hunting for the stupid price tags.Though it looks like a very nice toy , I would not recommend it to anyone . It 's definitely more annoying , both to parents and children , than it is fun .	-1
THIS TOY IS SO BORING , IT HURTS , AND ITS WAY OVERPRICED ! I GOT THIS FOR MY SON , HE IS 2 BUT LOVES PEEK A BLOCKS . HE ALSO DOES N'T HAVE A WAGON TO PULL AROUND SO I THOUGHT HE WOULD LOVE THIS . WELL THE FIRST TIME HE USED IT I THOUGHT HE BROKE HIS FINGERS . HE WAS SPINNING THE WHEEL REALLY FAST AND I HEARD A BANG AND THEN HE WAS SCREAMING . BEING UNAWARE OF THE SMASHED FINGERS THING , I DID N'T KNOW WHAT HAPPENED BUT THEN I SAW HIS FINGERS WERE STIFF AND RED . I THOUGHT THEY WERE BROKEN , HE JUST PLAYED WITH IT AGAIN TONIGHT AND THE SAME THING HAPPENED ( NOT AS BAD ) WELL I AM CALLING FISHER PRICE TOMORROW AND I WILL UPDATE ON WHAT THEY SAY TO ME . PLEASE DO N'T BUY THIS TOY , ITS SO SAD TO SEE THE BABIES SCARED OF THE TOY AFTER IT ALMOST CHOPS THEIR FINGERS OFF ! ! ! ! ! P.S .

Though I have not had any of the finger pinching problems like the other reviewers , I still do n't like it and niether do my 1 and 3 year old . It 's so boring . It does n't do really that much but light up . I would say if you 're going to buy it only buy for 1.5 years and younger . The blocks them selves are kinda cool but the wagon stinks !	-1
This wagon is a plain-and-simple ripoff . It is incredibly lacking and not fun , except for the actual PEEK-a-Blocks , which you can separately get sets of . So , I do n't recommend it to parents : at least for our son , it was n't fun or much of an educational product . In fact , we 're returning it . Its durability ( I mean , after all , it IS a Fisher-Price toy ) does n't make up for its other shortcomings .	-1
We received this item as a gift so luckily I did n't spend my own money on it ... ..First , it plays only one song , ONE SONG . At first it seems chirpy and fun , but after ten minutes of play and the same song over and over , it can drive you a little nuts.Second , the `` ferris '' wheel in the center is very hard to turn . There is no way a youngster can get this to move . It is awkward and the blocks do not tumble out as they should.Third , the yellow flap with the square cut out , does not fit properly on our wagon . It bows in the center . I usually just take the whole piece off.Fourth , its just plain boring . Neither of my kids are interested in it . Generally they take all the blocks out , turn off the music and pull the wagon around with their barbies in it.Overall , not very fun at all ! Save your money for something else .	-1
This thing is Horrible ! ! ! Not only is it very unintresting to my daughter ( 10 months ) but the few times she has tried to play with it she has gotten her fingers smashed in two diffrent activities ( one being the wheel and the other being a purple teeter totter looking thing . I am glad i got it on sale but still think i paid to much for it . This toy is useless and dangerous ! !	-1
This toy is cute , but that 's about it . I expected the blocks to actually `` tumble '' down the giraffe , perhaps in a zig-zag fashion . But they do n't ; they just `` drop '' straight to the bottom . There 's a button at the bottom that plays a cute little tune when the block hits the bottom , but that 's all this toy does . I guess I just expected more from it . We returned it . As a side note , we also got the Peek-a-Blocks Train and both my girls LOVE it ! Costs a little more than the giraffe , but is worth it !	-1
My 13 month old son received this for his 1st Birthday.He has not played with it since opening it . The giraffe is absolutely adorable but just sits among his other toys . He will play with the blocks every once in awhile - but even the blocks do not hold his attention .	-1
Oh my . These veggies are the hardest plastic , and the first thing my son did was dump the entire basket onto the hardwood floors . They immediately went back into the basket and got donated to the nursery at church where they have carpet . It sounded like a machine gun with all those little fruits and veggies hitting the floors . No bueno !	-1
I do like Carcassonne , so we thought adding this expansion would be worth the $ . Well , you get 18 new tiles , 6 large meeples , a set of grey meeples to play with 6 players , and you also get 50/100 scoring chips in case a player loops the scoring track , but in our experience , they certainly could have left those out - unneeded.The problems we had were the tiles seem to be a lot cheaper than in our original set - many of them tore or frayed at the edges as we were carefully trying to take them out . Some of the backings are already coming off after 3 plays , so when they are faced down in the pile and mixed with the regular tiles , you can already see if you 're going to get one of the new , special tiles.So , I guess our biggest issue is that for the money , this really is n't worth it . The box it comes in is a bit overkill , too . As for adding to the original game , yes , it adds 3 new factors , but overall , it 's not much different , really.That said , if you 've been dying to turn your regular Carcassonne into a 6 player game , well , this is a good way to do so . We have n't needed 6 players yet , though . : )	-1
I ca n't believe so many people gave this game high marks ... It 's rather depressing to realize so many people are limited by their exposure to better boardgames . I am a hardcore boardgame enthusiast . I 've played over 50 different games of this type . That is saying alot since each one of these games could take up to 3hrs or more . Puerto Rico is a low-medium depth game . For a group who is familiar with complex games , the rules can take about 10min . You can figure out the strategies yourself after the first three rounds . Just when the game can take off , it 's momentum is handicapped by the shipping rules . Each player must get rid of all his/her goods regardless if they want to or not . There are too many equalizers and caps on trade/barter that keep the game from really being competitive . Instead , it feels like the mechanics constrict the play too much to be really enjoyable . There is no breathing room to really out-strategize anyone.There was a comment by someone in another review that said the game was well-balanced since the scores were always super close . That only means the game rewards bad playing and punishes good playing to keep the scores neck and neck - an exact definition of an equalizer . What is the point of playing if the winner is decided by mechanics that make the verdict random ? The lack of competition snuffs out the will to play . I found this game totally tedious and frustrating . So did all the players who tried it with me . We had one person who knew the game and reluctantly taught it to us ( she never liked the game ) . I won the game by the way , and I hate it . So that speaks volumes ... P.S . How to win : I saw the best strategy right away . Get as much money as possible , as early as possible . Purchase the bonus victory points ; the cards that cost around 9-10coins . Once you have at least one , end the game right away so others do n't catch up . Fulfill the requirements of the bonus card while concurrently ending the game . Victory ... easy	-1
A good xylophone is hard to find , and unfortunately this is n't one of them . When making a musical instrument such as a xylophone , the very least one can do is create one with the correct pitch . This atonal mess is good for teaching kids how to play percussion only ; might as well buy a drum . I disagree with other reviewers that incorrect pitch is harmless - kids learn at an amazing speed , even as babies , and as they get older they will want to play the songs they love ! I would not buy this xylophone when there are so many others to choose from .	-1
It is pretty , but it sounds terrible . You can not play anything resembling a tune . Save your money and buy a toy that has actual notes . I love the Fisher price baby grand piano that has a complete octave .	-1
The product is beautiful but I was n't impressed with the actual sound of the product . I know that it is a toy and for play , but I still thought it was important that the sound was pleasant !	-1
This is a classic pinball game scaled to fit a coffee table . The durability , however , is below any thinkable standard . The tightening nut on the main lever broke after half of the game . Tightening did n't help for long , and my husband had to adjust the screw and actually weld it to the main part to make it hold . Our kids were more upset than happy with this toy : they are NOT the kind of kids who break toys and they are not used to seeing a toy break just from normal use . Will never buy from the same manufacturer , although we all love pinball games and will certainly try other companies .	-1
I 'm so disappointed with toy . It is cheaply made and not well made . None of the parts fit well . I bought this for my daughter last Christmas . It a huge waste of money . She has never play with it . I would pass on this toy if I were you .	-1
I bought this toy for my one year old niece . We were looking for toys to help her learn to comfort herself and go back to sleep on her own . We were hoping for a toy that played soft , soothing music and gently glowed . However , that is not what this toy does . The & quot ; songs & quot ; are so loud they can be heard over all noise in a busy room ( tv , talking , ringing phone , etc . ) and in a quiet room it was so loud the noise made ME jump . Also , the toy is very heavy and the hard plastic center that houses the music device can be felt easily through the padding . My glowworm did not come with a book , either , even though the picture indicated it did . I have written Hasbro about the quality of this product and I hope that if you want a nap time or bedtime toy for your child you will buy the vintage version instead . Some things do n't need & quot ; improving & quot ; .	-1
I grew up with my own precious gloworm , which I absolutely adored , and was thrilled to see this online ! We purchased it , but should have waited to see it in person before doing so . My daughter is 4 months , and does not like it at all . The & quot ; glow & quot ; is quite bright and the & quot ; lulubies & quot ; are rather loud . We were able to hear the music clearly on the other side of our home - much too loud for us . However , my older toddler did seem to like it , but I still returned it because I did not think I could stand hearing the music over and over again ( which is what toddlers do ! ) So , if you are looking to purchase this for an older toddler/child , it could be good - if you are buying it for a baby , let the baby see it first -- - it was much to loud and bright for our tenderhearted little one ...	-1
We purchased this for our son when he 2-3 months old . He did not enjoy it very much at all until he was able to sit up . The only thing he liked and could reach at that time was the mobile on the bottom , and his crib mobile was much more entertaining . Once he could sit up , he liked to play with it a little bit , but was never entertained for long . Now that he can stand , he likes to pull up on it , but has even less interest in any of the buttons . I was intrigued by the international/multi-language aspect of this toy , but I think it was too much for an infant .	-1
As with all toys , some kids love certain toys some kids do n't . Either way one thing that is not subjective about this toy is that it is a HUGE battery hog . When our son was born we bought a ton of rechargeable batteries and the different chargers given all of these toys and soothers and gyms use batteries . Of all the toys this was one of the biggest battery hogs and my son rarely even played with it . It becamee such a nusance to constantly change the batteries ( sometimes two to three times in a day/play session and we even tried throw away batteries , it 's the toy not the batteries ) that we finally just gave it away . The mobile is nothing great and does n't move that well , the songs and words in different languages are nice but there just was n't much to entertain a little one , I think I was more interested in the different languages than he was . Sometimes all these whistles and bell type toys are just too overstimulating or are n't that inviting to a newborn . In regard to sitting up and playing with this toy , we did n't even waste our time , we gave it away before he tried that feature . This was one of the least played with toys we 've bought . Your child may love it , but mine did n't but please remember , some children take to what others do n't . Though my overall assesment would be to pass on this one , not only for the uninteresting activities but more for the amount of batteries you will go through . There are better choices .	-1
I was really disappointed . My 6 year old thinks it 's neat , but does n't understand how limited the learning possibilities are for him . The box claimed 10 different experiments . They are primarily about mixing colors ... so not as educational as we 'd hoped for . There is one about hot vs. cold water activity with the colors , one using milk and another one with the crystals ... the rest are basically just color mixing . So I 'd say really about 3 , just OK experiments . Knowing this I think it 's not worth over $ 5 ... if you can get one that cheap and you 're children are young , then it 's worth it . Otherwise , it 's a waste of time and money .	-1
This came it quite a beat up box and there are n't enough supplies in it to do all of the experiments . I had to make a few alterations .	-1
My 16 month old daughter loves this toy . Especially all the sounds they make . ( They make so many more sounds than I remember . Although no doorbell anymore : ( ) . Her favorite is the telephone and computer sounds . But it also makes a washing machine sound , clock timer , 2 seperate baby sounds , and the toilet swooshing . All get a workout . We do have a hard time keeping up with all the extra parts to it ; in one room or the other . But you have to expect that as a parent you will have lots of parts to pick up of any toy . She really enjoys it , and that 's what is important . Keep in mind too that it is still the most popular toy she got at Christmas . I would recommend buying one more set of toys with people included in it . We bought the bus/ice cream truck set . It came with one extra person and extra fencing . ( Keep an eye out for all of this series , they tend to go on sale at Target , Babies R Us , etc . I saved easily $ 20.00 buying it at Target compared to the regular retail of $ 39.95 )	-1
One of my children was given this as a birthday gift , and while the kids like it okay and do play with it some , I have a few issues with it . First , as others have mentioned , there is no lid to the box . Annoying ! Secondly , the paint does come off the pieces ! Of course , being `` food '' , kiddos are going to put pieces in their mouths to pretend-eat it . ( Even though I always tell them not to ! ) It is very obvious which pieces have been in kids ' mouths , due to the paint chipping and wearing off . Even if it 's lead-free , it 's not a great thing to have happen ! Third , there are just too many little pieces for this mom 's preference and I end up finding them strewn all through the house . And finally , it 's just odd to me that the two of the cake toppings are jelly beans and gumdrops . Overall , I do not like this toy and would not recommend it to others .	-1
My son got this as a Christmas gift this last Christmas ( he 's 3 ) . He really likes it but I do n't . It 's hard to serve the cake because the spatula is more round and you ca n't fit a lot of the decorations on there . If you want the & # 34 ; Happy Birthday & # 34 ; piece on there , you are out of luck to fit a lot of sprinkles on there which leaves quite a bit of blank areas . You also ca n't cut the cake without removing the birthday saying . My son enjoys it though and the quality is good as most Melissa and Doug products are but I would probably rethink this toy .	-1
I bought this for my daughter 's 2nd birthday . The Velcro is crap , you can see the glue holding it on and it falling apart . She has n't played with it enough for the paint to come off as others have mentioned . I just expected better .	-1
You know , I am not one to rate something low and I already have Badger products that I love , but THIS product came BROKEN in THREE ways . The velcro on the doors are stapled , fine . The other piece , the one that attaches to the door -- glued and floating around , so not really glued . There are two places where the nails are completely stripped ... .just slide right in . Great . And , the topper , the piece where the velcro is supposed to be attached to has three prescrewed sections and glue -- but mine , not even attached . So , my options are to rig it or return it . UGH . It is cute , I must say . BUT , the staples on the cloth even look pretty shotty . Not sure that this will look good for long . I am just very disappointed . UGH	-1
It just is n't very rugged . Seems it is n't built for the right age group . It would probably last fine for older girls , who are more able to treat things delicately , but ... those girls do n't play with dolls anymore . Little girls that play with dolls need this kind of thing to be able to handle less nimble hands and fingers that may get a little rougher sometimes . The design is really cute and made it very popular ... while it lasted .	-1
There are much cuter activity walkers out there on the market , but , they also cost more money , so you have to decide what is important for you in a walker . Personally , my son only used the walker through his cruising to walking phase . As soon as he became a confident walker the toy lost all interest . I put it away in the `` baby '' things and was satisfied with the job it did helping him gain confidence in walking . That being said , if you want a toy to leave out and have your child play wiht after he learns to walk , this is not the toy . The mail slots come off way too easily and are boring . The mail pieces always wind up lost in the sea of toys and parts in the house . The accessory toys ( bug themed ) on the walker are way too hard to manipulate , plus never made much sense to me since the theme is a mailbox , what are the bugs doing on it ? ! You have to choose for yourself what you want in a walker and then go out and buy for those needs/wants .	-1
I got this as a gift for our daughter when she was around 10 months old . All the other reviews are right - the doors break off WAY TOO EASILY ! But our daughter really liked it , and for that one month , she used it as a walker to help her walk.Now she uses it with her playhouse , and sticks all kinds of things into it . She is now a year and a half and though it sits along the wall , she still uses it with her other toys . When her friends come over , they always want to play with it for 2-3 minutes , and then they move on . The other noise-makers on the walker keep little 1 year olds interested for a little while as well.I think it was a great gift , but I would not have bought it . 2 stars for durability ( due to the doors - they are still somewhere around the house ) .	-1
I bought this walker because it looked nice and sturdy for my 11-month-old , who can not wait to walk on his own . He rarely uses it as a walker though . He 's more interested in pulling the doors off the front of it , and on more than one occasion has used it as a climbing tool . Once he even fell and split his lip open . The doors on this thing should be attatched better , and barring that , the toy should be recalled .	-1
this is a terrible toy ! Like all of the other reviews say the mail doors come off way to easy . Both of my boys would try to walk with it but the toy would not stay up and they both just fell on there backs . And then within 2 days the toy would just collapse ! Once I walked in the boys bedroom just in time to see one of the boys standing on the toy where the doors are supposed to be lifting himself up to the crib and almost falling . I just with I could return this toy . What a waste of money and it is too dangerous to donate .	-1
My husband and I bought this toy for my 8 month old daughter . We liked it because it was the only one on the market that had & quot ; cruise control & quot ; and we thought that would be important since we have hardwood floors . We spent almost an hour putting it together and then we let the little one try it out . At first she was so excited to play with the toys . But as soon as she opened the mail box and started to climb up . The the flap popped off and she fell on the front of the walker busting her lip . Needless to say it went back to the toy store and we bought the playzone activity walker . She likes the colors , sounds and sturdy craftsmanship better than the little tikes .	-1
While looking for a sturdy toy for my 2 yr old grand nephew I was attracted to this . However , for the life of me I ca n't figure out why they are charging $ 450.00 for it ! Who in their right mind would pay that much money for a little boy to play with ? Good grief !	-1
My grandson loves these crayons , but I wo n't buy them again . They are really hard to clean off the tub . I needed to use cleanser to get the crayon off . Get the tub markers instead - they just rinse off when you are done .	-1
This sells for $ 6 on crayolastore dot comIt is disgusting how Amazon allows merchants to overprice children 's toys on their site ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! The current Amazon merchant price of over $ 20 then PLUS SHIPPING COSTS , is absolutely ridiculous .	-1
dd received this as a gift at around 1 yr of age . She was just learning to walk at the time and we found that the stroller was very light and not sturdy enough for her to assist in her new walking ventures . We put away and pulled out a couple of months later when she started having an interest in her stuffed animals and now loves running around with it.PROS : - Very light weight- Great height for young kids- Easy to use Canopy- Fairly easy to assemble- Once strapped in , holds dolls in securly- We did n't have the same `` wheel '' problem that others did , however dd is pretty gentle with her toys- Holds many sizes of dolls , stuffed animals , etcCONS : - Very `` girly '' - Only fits smaller dolls because the straps are too short to fit around larger dolls ( even the the seat is wide enough and tall enough to hold up to an 18 ' doll ) - Velcro is hard for little hands to secure because straps are shorter- Does n't `` fold-up '' making it difficult to take on trips to grandma & grandpas houseTHERE ARE BETTER ONES OUT THERE FOR THE PRICE ( GRACO UMBRELLA DOLL STROLLER $ 9.99 ) - ALTHOUGH MAKES A GREAT `` FIRST STROLLER ''	-1
It seemed like a good stroller in the store , we have had a few cheap fabric umbrella doll strollers that ripped ( my kids ' are hard on stuff ! ! ) so I figured with an all plastic seat we would be good here . Not so , the wheels constantly fall off , we have lost one of them so now the stroller is no good . The seat belt comes out and is a frustration to me to keep putting it back in.And it does n't fit any other dolls well , if you have a lot of small dolls it 's ok but only one of my daughter 's dolls fits in here . It 's fine for a short child as a first stroller , maybe in the 1-2 year old range as long as they have help putting the doll in it . Otherwise save a few bucks and just get one of those $ 7.99 umbrella strollers Toys R us sells !	-1
My two older kids , ages 4 and 5 , really enjoy playing with the two melissa and doug stamp sets we bought . The stamps are good quality , there are lots of them for the price , and there is a nice assortment of designs . More than two stamp pad colors would be nice but for this price I 'm ok with it . The stamps are pretty gender neutral but the ink colors are not so maybe a green or brown would be better choices . I know girls usually are the ones to use stamps but boys like craft projects too . The colored pencils are not so great and I 'm not sure why they are even included . The kids use their own colored pencils when they feel like coloring the stamps . The stamps come in a nice wooden box but there is no cover on the box which is a shame since it would be nice to be able to use the box and keep them organized rather than have put them in a shoe box.The kids would be playing with this set several times a week if the ink was washable but it 's not . It 's not at all . It 's as difficult to get out of clothing and hands as pen ink and requires scrubbing with a magic eraser to get it off the table . Washable markers wipe right off the same table with a damp rag . The kids do n't care for coloring the stamp with a marker and like the stamp pads but they seldom get to use them because there is no time to cover the table with grocery bags or spend 20 minutes scrubbing ink off . I 'm also very concerned they will drop a stamp on the carpet ( all our tables have carpet under them ) and I wo n't be able to get it out . It says something that the cleanup involved with school glue and markers is preferable to these . I had always thought of stamps as a 'clean ' art project .	-1
This product was great ! That was until we tried to put together the pig . That was when we realized that we have some duplicate pictures on some of the blocks . That means no matter how hard my daughter tries she can never get the picture to look right . So buyer beware that you might only have a few animals that your child can put together correctly . We did compare the blocks to the picture just to confirm the block mistake . I had my wife double check the blocks just to make sure . I would have rated it 4 stars except the pictures do n't all match up . I do n't know how long the blocks would hold up because the pictures are just stickers . Thankfully we bought it through amazon and just returned it .	-1
This would have been awesome if it did n't fall apart in every way . My daughter was so excited when she got it , it 's colorful and has fun features . But it falls apart to the point of being unusable . It makes her so mad . Considering the cost , DO NOT BUY .	-1
My 2.5 daughter received this for Christmas from her Grammy . She had been talking about it for months and was so excited to open it . The tops come off for easy access to the castle , and she was able to put them back on okay by herself . But any little touch made them fall over , and I almost broke my hand trying to get the swing back on ! The balloon 's basket was way too small to put a bear in , and this is just made very cheap compared to her smaller Care Bear sets . So , we exchanged it for the Care Bears Ferris Wheel , which is much more fun for her . However , she kept asking where her castle was , so when I came across the new Lil ' Kingdom Castle for Little People by Fisher-Price , we got that . It was HALF the price of the C.B . castle , and is 100 % more fun and durable . Plus , she can find a place for all 16 members of her growing Care Bear family on the F-P castle ! Hope this helps you all !	-1
This toy would have been good for youngsters if they had simply used lower-case letters . Unfortunately , focusing exclusively on the upper-case alphabet is disastrous for those learning to read.LeapFrog forces you to buy an expansion pack to get the lower-case letters , an extra hidden expense . However , most parents either will receive this as a gift or wo n't realize when buying it that the expansion pack exists , or may not know that teaching a child to recognize only upper-case letters is actually a DETRIMENT to early reading ability.Many upper-case letters bear little or no resemblance to their lower-case counterparts . Almost all text is printed in lower-case , with the occasional upper-case letter to start a sentence or proper noun . This means that a young one who wants to start sounding out words around her is best served by learning lower-case letters first . In fact , learning the upper-case alphabet comes as a free bonus to a young learner . ( For example , reading the word `` The '' at the start of a sentence will teach a young reader about capital T , since in context the word will be easy to recognize . ) Apart from the fact that LeapFrog only ships upper-case letters in order to increase your total purchase price , the implementation of the toy is suboptimal . Each letter is presented with a maximum of two sounds . This has caused some confusion with my 3-year-old , since letters like `` a '' have more sounds that pop up in common early reading words.In addition , the sounds are presented in a worthlessly sappy-cute way : `` 'T ' goes [ t ] ; 't ' goes [ t ] . Every letter makes a sound . 'T ' goes 't ' . '' It would have been much more helpful to just have each common sound fully represented , and not have to listen to the whole spiel . The common repetition can not enhance recollection at all.Buy or recommend this set only with the caveat that the expansion pack with lower case letters must also be purchased , and the upper-case letters stored away . Otherwise , the recipient child will wind up able to read all-caps titles and banners , and little else .	-1
I bought this for my kids and after an hour I could n't take the noise this toy makes any longer ! I feel that Fisher Price makes better toys that make more tolerable sounds - this toy has an annoying voice and song . I think the best method for learning the alphabet is sitting down and learning wit an actual person , not a loud , annoying toy . I am going to concentrate on buying wooden toys from this point on .	-1
I guess I should have looked closer at all of the pictures , including the ones at the bottom of the description . I just saw the ones at the top in the main list of pictures and saw the lowercase letters . That 's the whole reason I ordered it . The one I got is all uppercase . I guess that 's what mean by `` styles may vary '' ? Teaching uppercase letters only , or primarily , can cause serious reading delays and issues . Most letters in reading and writing are lowercase and lowercase letters should be the focus for teaching letters initially . Going to see if another store has this with the lowercase version that I can exchange , or I 'll have to send it back to Amazon . Bummed .	-1
I bought this toy awhile back for my daughter , and this was one of her least favorite things to play with , not to mention that the voice that sang the songs was totally annoying and irratating . not to mention that most of the pieces ended up underneath the refridgerator . never the less the toy ended up being tossed in the trash and neither me nor my daughter miss it at all .	-1
While 4 stars may be what my son would rate this if he could talk better , I purchased this new and when we got home his older siblings brought to my attention that the letters where different than what the toy was saying they were . You would put a `` G '' in and hear `` J '' for that letter verbally . This was the case with more than half the alphabet . I called the company who had me on old 45 minutes because the Fly Pen was eating up their phone time with other problems . They told me to take a Qtip with alcohol on it and clean the prongs in the window where the letter goes , then use a tweezer to pull out the prongs that were too far in ( brand new prongs out of the box mind you ) . This was only ruining the plastic prongs and not working on loosening them up for the tweezer to pull out . Returned for refund to the store and explained it to them . Kid appeal , adult aggravation .	-1
My daughter who is 17 months old , has every leap frog learning toy made . I was so excited about this product ... until I got it home . My daughter had a very hard time understanding what to do . She ended up pulling off the book and just pressing the pad . The concept is great , but the actual toy is n't .	-1
Our son , now one year old , has liked the leap pad since we got it several months ago . He pushes the buttons to hear the music and sound effects . However he also is fascinated by the slot where the sound card is inserted . He keeps pulling out the sound card which makes it hard to read the books to him . If Leap Frog designed this to secure the sound card then our son might not be distracted by pulling it out so much .	-1
We bought this for our son at 6-months and then it it was nice because it was great for story time to hear music and soundscapes . However , it was no more fun ( or animated ) than when we read our paper books with lots of sound effects . Now he 's 16-months and only turns it on and off because the touch pad is too difficult to activate for little fingers . His favorite book to hear is `` Mr. Brown can Moo can You '' . This is a great book with lots of sounds but my son ca n't get it to work on his own . So this toy is only good when I am playing with him . In that case , I prefer to cuddle up with a good old fashioned hard bound Mr Brown and make my own `` Moo '' . I should have waited for the other leap pads . I hear they 're great .	-1
We bought this for our 1 1/2 year old for Christmas along with a bunch of books and the carry case . What a waste of money . She likes my 4 year olds leappad because of the pencil . Thinking this was more for her age , I got this one . I wish I did n't She has n't even looked at it for more than 2 minutes at a time .	-1
this seems like a marvelous toy , but we have been quite disappointed in it . My son received it last Christmas and it has never been a big hit . it is just too difficult for a child under 3 to understand the concepts of changing settings , pressing the `` go '' circle each time you turn the page and of course little hands are going to pull the story book cards out . frankly , likes his Clifford the Big Red Dog regular books much better . Think very seriously before you invest , because of course it only comes with one book . wish we has skipped this one .	-1
When this 1st came out I was so excited , I purchased all 6 of the additional books sets and could n't wait for my daughter to be old enough to play with it ! Well , now that my daughter is old enough , I 'm really disappointed . You have to press down really hard to get the areas you want to work . So hard I ca n't imagine a young toddler being able to do so . It frustrates my daughter so much that she now just grabs my hand and puts it to the picture she wants me to press down on . As all toddlers do , she loves to turn the book on and off . Not good for this since it looses all information on what level you are on and you must push the green go circle on every page , needless to say the only thing my daughter can do is turn the book on and off ! The books are cute and have a lot of neat sounds and saying , it 's just right now this just absolutely frustrates my daughter ! We are much happier with Mattel 's Learn Through Music .	-1
The concept of this product is great . However , it is too hard for a smaller child to use . Ex : you have to press the green `` go '' button everytime you turn a page ... my two year old does n't do that and it completely messes up the purpose of the game . He will be on a page of `` blue '' pictures but since he did n't press `` go '' , the page is telling him that the pictures are `` red '' because it is still on the page from before . If I use it with him it works great , but he can not play with it by himself . We purchased this as a toy for the car because we travel frequently , but it is of no use to us in the car . If LeapFrog could improve on the `` green go '' button , it would be much better .	-1
My 12 month old gets extremely excited when I bring this toy out for her , as she loves books and music , but SHE wants to turn the pages and the whole concept is just over her head . Maybe if the pages were more durable it would help but I think this is a toy that we will keep on the shelf for the most part until she is a bit older .	-1
Read a real book to your kids it would be more entertaining and educational . A book that has noises or flaps is cheaper and more fun for you and your child . for many resons - keep reading the rest of the reviews- this toy is n't worth spending money on . I do love all the other leap frog products . Very dissapointed leapfrogger ! ! !	-1
If your child is a leapfrog button pushing kid , SKIP THIS TOY ! ! ! ! Who had the bright idea of the sound and on/off being green buttons on a white field right on the front ? ? ? ? ? ? All she wants to do is push the buttons ! ! ! ! Once she turns it off I have to reset it with the green go circle on the side of the page , etc . She did not care about it at , then she wanted to just rip the books off . She is strong but can not trigger the page noises . The toy is just a dud . Buy the 2 leapfrog movies instead , those are great . All I do with this toy is scold her not to rip on the books or push the buttons . No fun for either of us .	-1
I got this for my son when he was 14 months . It is not a toy ( at that age or younger ) that you will be able to give to them to play with.Having to press 'go ' everytime you turn a page is a pain and in narration mode the music plays too long after pressing go , before the narration starts . By then my son is ready to turn the page.My son is not really interested in this toy . I expect as he gets older he may like it better.As far as using it for a younger child as a way to read books , I think it is much more beneficial for them to hear your voice then to use something like this.Save your $ $ and get him one of the other Leap Frog toys when he is older !	-1
I love Leapfrog toys . My daughter loves all the ones we have and they are educational and durable . This toy was my first choice to take with us on vacation for the hotel and the plane . What a mistake . The concept is very good however many things need improvement . The books that you use with this have thin cardboard pages . My daughter had destroyed a few pages in a week . Also when you turn on the page you have to press go for the reader to know which page your on . This frustrated my daughter who would turn pages and touch the pages only to have it reading the previous page . She had a little more fun with the card that is included with the book but it occupied her for a very short while . My daughter likes to do things on her own so even when I tried to help her with this we ended up more frustrated than anything . We then went out and bought the Fisher Price Learn Through Music and have had much success with it instead . We are saving this for when my daughter is a little older and will be able to control this better . It is a very good toy but I feel it is better suited to children old enough to exhibit the patience this toy requires to properly play with it . my daughter is almost 2 and very smart but this was one toy that truly frustrated and upset her to the point where she 'd throw it aside and play with something else .	-1
I bought this for my son for christmas when he was 14 months old . He never really liked it . You have to push the pages to hard for them to say anything . my son is now 2 and he still cant really get them to say anything . I think Really an adult has to be the one to push the buttons so that makes the kids upset because they cant get the book to say anything . I really would recomend not wasteing your money on this . It is kinda expensive .	-1
I 'm a big fan of Leapfrog toys , but this one was disappointing . Little fingers can not push hard enough to activate the books . We did n't get much use out of it .	-1
I wish this Leap Pad had lived up to its potential ! I was so excited when it came out just in time for my 3rd child . My older two had greatly enjoyed Leappad products , and I was eager to start my youngest on them too . I bought the Little Touch and 3 book sets right away . My daughter was too young at first to try them . I first gave it a try when she was 6 months , and she had no interest . So I tried again at 9 months . This time she was VERY interested , but it was a totally frustrating time for her . She caught on right away she needed to touch the pages , but no matter how hard she tried , she could n't touch hard enough . She broke into tears after a short time . I tried touching for her , but she has little interest in books unless she can hold and mouth them . She tried holding the pages , and badly wrinkled several of them . It 's not really a fun learning experience when you are constantly saying `` no '' ! I do like the whole idea of this product , and I think that if they overcame some of the engineering problems , it would be quite nice . I like the different levels , so that you can just hear music , or hear simple phrases , or hear the whole book . The activity cards included with each book also seem a bit more heavy duty than the regular books , but they too greatly frustrated us in terms of being touchable ! I also question including Where the Wild Things Are as one of the books . I love the book , and my sons do too , but it 's NOT a baby book -- -it 's probably fine for 3 and up , but not really something a baby would relate to . I think it 's a choice to draw in parents , not babies.I might try the similar Fisher-Price product if I can find it for a low price . Sorry , Leap Pad !	-1
I bought this when I found it packaged with the Lulu Letter Spinning Spider . Unfortunately , my daughter does n't care for the system itself . She knows where the button is to turn it on and off so she does that a few times . Sometimes you have to pull around at the book to be able to press and get a sound to come which is a pain . You 'd think it would have been made better to allow no flaws with touching the images on the book . I was actually disapointed with the product and bought a few books with it . My daughter is almost 2 so maybe later she 'll take more interest in it . For now , she sticks with regular books.UPDATE : I deleted and am reposting my review with fewer stars . As we have had this since Christmas , it has stayed in a box since purchase . My daughter has no interest in this at all . I should have just bought the lulu spinning spider on its own .	-1
This was one of my favorite toys when I was a child ( back in the 70 's ) and I was excited to purchase it for my daughter . It is n't as well made as or easy to use as it used to be back in the day !	-1
I had one as a kid in the eighties and I just loved it . So when my daughter received this as a gift I was just over the moon.And then we tried it out and ... it does n't work.The pink gear template does not snap into place allowing the small orange gears to slide around and it does n't create the pretty spiral it is supposed to . Why is it they had a great one in 1984 but 27 years later ... they sell a non-working version for quadruple the price ?	-1
Santa brought my toddler this for Christmas . She jumped on it a handful of times and it started to get leaks in it . We found and patched one of the leaks but shortly afterward , 2 more happened in other sections . : ( I hate to throw it away because she loves it , so we keep pumping it up every day but this thing is becoming more of a hassle than anything else . I wish it would have been of better quality .	-1
My daughter loved this toy when we bought it . I did n't get the pump , and it took us forever to inflate it . so if you have to have this toy , make sure to get the pump or use an attachment that works with a vacuum cleaner . Within a month , the seams were splitting and it would deflate . We were even cautious about kids getting on it without shoes ! the only places where we got air leaks were the seams , and the patch kit did n't quite seal those up .	-1
Neds head does not stay up or in the shape it should be . It just keeps falling flat on itself . The kids thought it was great , but it got old pretty quick .	-1
What kind of sick game is this ? I mean pulling bugs , food and other nasties out of someone 's head and also how did Ned get all those things in his head without killing himself in the first place ? Who came up with this game ? The Guys who made the Cool World movie ? How do you even win let alone lose at this game ? I give this game a 0 out of 10 .	-1
I 'm not sure how this toy ended up with a 4.5 star rating after all the broken microphones ! ! Ours was yet another that broke within 2 months of gentle play . It was n't thrown or dragged around by the microphone or anything of the sort . My son loved it and figured out the microphone very quickly . He loved to see the lights and the little puppy `` dance '' when he `` sang '' into the microphone . I continued to let him play with it even after the microphone shorted out and the static began and he still kept trying the microphone until he got frustrated and then I finally put it away . I wish I had spent the money on something that would have lasted longer . My son is now 18 months old and the only other toy he has ever managed to break was the Vtech Nursery Farm which was broken 3 weeks after Christmas last year , just before this piano broke . I highly recommend Fisher Price or LeapFrog toys over Vtech . We have never had a problem with their toys and 2 of the 3 Vtech toys we have owned have broken on us . Garbage ! !	-1
We bought this dollhouse , because when we went to the store , it had an adorable display and looked like a step up from the Twintime Dollhouse , which has very small rooms . You could press the button on the display , and the people would talk to each other . My kids thought it would be great . When we were at Toys R Us , I looked for accessory furniture/people/animal sets to go along with this dollhouse . I did not see any . I thought it was probably due to Christmas just having passed . We got home , opened the dollhouse and discovered that there really were not many phrases that the provided people/furnitureanimal did , so I went to Amazon to try to find more sets in order to achieve the purpose of this dollhouse ( to get the 200 phrases ) . Thats when reality set in that we had just made a huge mistake . You can not find ANY accesory pieces for this set . You can go on Ebay and pay many times more than the original price for USED furniture . I was really disappointed . I even tried the Fisher Price website , only to find that they are marketing the Twintime Dollhouse furniture for this Sweet Sounds Dollhouse . What a shame and a sham ... . I really like Fisher Price toys and we have many , but I am very disappointed in the fact that they are trying to fool the consumer . What good is a dollhouse , if you can not get it to accomplish what it says it will do -- -200 phrases . Not to mention , what is included with the Sweet Sounds Dollhouse is not much . Just a Mom , Dad , girl , baby , swing , cradle , radio , cat , and a scant few more pieces . Definately not enough to keep the kids interested for long ! There are actually three Fisher Price dollhouses that are still available , this one , the Twintime Dollhouse , and the one we eventually ended up buying at Value City ( also available on Ebay ) -- the Fisher Price Special Edition Townhouse . It has a doorbell that rings , doors that open , birds that sing , phone that rings , lights that come on , fridge light comes on , computer lights up ( and is part of a desk set attached to the dollhouse ) , and a fireplace that crackles and lights up ( which is also attached to the dollhouse ) . These things are all ON THE DOLLHOUSE itself . No accesory furniture or people are needed to make this happen . The battery replacement compartment is on the back on this dollhouse not the bottom , like the Sweet Sounds one . The front of the Townhouse has flower boxes with likelike flowers you place in them ( comes with the set ) . You can get it A LOT cheaper than the Sweet Sounds Dollhouse , too ( almost half the cost ) . It comes with a great deal of furniture : 2 beds with pillows and comforters and blankets , a lawnchair , 3 people , potted plant , real curtains , kitchen table and chairs , clothing for the people , computer chair , lounge chair and more . The kitchen counter , stove , microwave and fridge are part of the dollhouse . It also has closet doors that open and stairs the people can walk up . You practically do not need to buy anything else , but if you do , you can get the Loving Family accesory people and furniture sets . This dollhouse is so much larger to boot . There is plenty of room to put everything . It shuts and closes together just like the Sweet Sounds , but it is clearly larger . We also thought about the Twintime , but it had too many comments on how small the rooms were and the display at Toys R Us looked jammed packed . I did not know how more than one child could play with it and not have a shoving match , because they could not play , as well.My kids absolutely the Townhouse with all of its sounds , especially the doorbell . The great thing about it is that these are greatly reduced in price , because they are an older model , which is what they should do with the Sweet Sounds Dollhouse . Let the public know ahead of time , so their kids do not get disappointed , because it does not live up to what it says at the store . Thank Goodness I was able to take mine back , because I had my receipt and box . Be careful and keep the box and receipt if you do choose to buy this dollhouse even after all of the warnings , because after your kids see that it does not do what it says and because it is on the small side compared with the Townhouse version , they may not want to keep it . When we took ours back , a Toys R Us worker stopped and talked to us and agreed that Fisher Price is just trying to get rid of their extra stock of Sweet Sounds Dollhouses . Unfortunately , it is at the consumers expense and disappointment ! !	-1
My 2 year-old daughter received this toy for her 2nd birthday . She was so excited about it and played with it for all of an hour . That was a month and a half ago and Lily has n't been played with since . She really does n't do much . She only sings two songs ! Really , really boring toy .	-1
we loved the baby hug n learn tad , and bought this item for a birthday gift and was very disappointed . it doesnt light up like the baby tad . and the buttons are more difficult to press and it is not musical .	-1
Our 14 mo . old daughter received this as a gift . It was a waste of money- the buttons are so hard to push that she ca n't operate the doll without adult assistance . It does n't really does n't do much except sing a couple of songs- one of our least favorite toys she has !	-1
We attempted to get the Ladybug Land for our bug loving child . The item we received was very different than the item pictured on Amazon . The one pictured shows the different levels almost up to the top of the dome for the bugs to hang out and walk around . The one we received has just one level of path to walk on , and the rest is just wasted space filled with air . Not fun at all . We exchanged it , Amazon sent us a new one , and it was the same thing . Thinking the older model had the extra climbing and walking paths , the newer version is junk . Do n't waste your money .	-1
We are quite disappointed in this product . I followed the directions and mold started growing in the habitat while the ladybugs were in their pupa stage . It was so gross that I ended up putting it outside with the lid off . Then the ants discovered it and we never got to the adult stage . Even before the mold developed it just was n't as interesting as the butterfly kit .	-1
What 's the point of paying for Amazon Prime when packages keep arriving late ? ? ? ? It does n't matter how fun a toy is for a 3 year old , when it comes the day AFTER their birthday ! ! !	-1
We ordered the Lady Bug Land for our daughter for Easter . There were no lady bugs included ! NO WHERE on the order form in their catalogue or on their website does it say anything about the lady bugs NOT being included . So they give you a coupon and an order form that says you have to include FIVE DOLLARS for shipping and handling of the lady bugs , after we already paid $ 19.99 . TOTAL RIP OFF . Do not order this product . If you want your child to learn about lady bugs , you 're better off just walking out to your back yard in the spring and get your own lady bugs ! ! !	-1
I was excited to purchase this for my kids to witness the life cycle of lady bugs . I also have an organic vegetable garden and was equally excited to release the adult lady bugs into it when they were adults . I never got to fully do either ... ..I found this kit when I was searching for `` live lady bugs '' to order as beneficial insects for my garden . I though this would be great . Based on the first two 5 star reviews from 2004 on this product I went ahead and ordered.- You have to pay $ 5 more to have the lady bug larvae shipped to you ... . ( I wish this was in larger print on the product description page , not a big deal as I understand shipping live insects does cost money , just wish I had seen it before ordering ) - Our first batch of larvae all arrived DOA . I emailed customer service and they told me to wait a week to make sure before contacting them back . They said sometimes the larvae do not move much and need time to acclimate . I wrote them back after a week as everything still was DOA.- The second batch arrived a few days later . The company does ship well and provided tracking and email confirmations which was nice . This time only half the contents of the shipping vial were DOA . You can clearly see the live ones moving around . I think the week wait was a little much . You should be able to discern viability in just 24-36 hrs . However , they do make you wait the required number of days.- We filled the dome food tray with the wet sponge and placed the larvae inside . Soon mold began to grow on the food sponge and larvae started dying . Within one week all the larvae were dead despite us cleaning out the mold and following the instructions to the letter ! - It is a real heart breaking experience for the kids to watch the larvae not make it . We also do n't like seeing that as well . I believe the habitat 's design could be better improved upon . The larvae food , feeding , water sponge and air circulation seem to be the main factors that affected us.- I can only conclude that I would have been way better off just ordering larvae and putting them directly out in my garden . The kids could have visited the garden and we could have tried seeing them there . After spending $ 20 to end up with a cheap plastic habitat that will end up in the garbage and to watch 2 sets of lady bug larvae die , it was definitely not worth it ! I think there are some major issues here ... .. I wish I could return this but by the time all of this has occurred it is now past the 30 return window.I hope this review helps and perhaps has saved some lady bug larvae lives ... .. Anything that involves live creatures should absolutely be well tested and continually monitored and updated as needed to ensure the best for the creatures and people involved . This is just not acceptable .	-1
It 's a small jar and once the lady bugs FINALLY arrived , they never ended up hatching . Big waste of money .	-1
The LadyBug Land arrived in perfect condition , no problems with that item itself . But , then we ordered the larvae from Insect Lore ( with the coupon code included in this item ) .The package arrived earlier than tracking information indicated and was placed in my mailbox where it sat in the August heat in St. Louis for several hours since I was n't expecting it til the next day . I was surprised they were shipping it in such hot weather to begin with ( temps were 90's-100 ) so I was very worried and keeping track of where it was so I could make sure I 'd get to them quickly.They were in a white , unmarked bubble mailer - no indication of anything living inside of it . When I opened it , it was obvious they were ALL dead . There were about 20 larvae in there . I had hoped maybe once I got them into their LadyBug Land and put a couple drops of water on the sponge that they would perk up or something , but they did n't . All obviously dead.I sent Insect Lore emails and pictures of the dead larvae - no response . It 's been 2 weeks and I do n't expect to hear back from them ... I 'm planning on filing a complaint with amazon and seeing if they 'll have better luck getting in touch with Insect Lore than I have.We ordered butterfly larvae from Insect Lore last year and had a great experience ! We expected it to be the same with the ladybugs , but we are VERY disappointed.My 5yr old daughter is so very disappointed , as am I . She cried because they were all dead and she did n't even get a chance to see them do anything.I would NOT recommend this product . *** UPDATE ***I still have had no response from Insect Lore as of 03/11/14 ...	-1
My 2-year old received this for Christmas . Within the first 5 minutes , he scraped his little teeth over the front ambulance metallic bump . It came right off and was in his mouth . Because I was right next to him , I got it out . I emailed directly to Melissa and Doug , but I never heard anything back from them .	-1
We got one of these as a gift , and it was a total failure . The `` Vehicle Sound Block '' toy is supposed to make the sounds of the vehicles when the blocks are lined up correctly . We got the batteries in , but the toy simply did n't work . No sound , no nothin . ' We also were given one of their farm sound puzzle toys and could n't get the back panel for the batteries to open . Tried using a small philips screwdriver , a safety pin , etc. , and it simply would not open . The lack of sound was disappointing , though our child still liked the pretty puzzle . This company seems to do well with plain wood toys , but when they branch out into electronics , the products are fairly shoddy . I plan to avoid their products in the future .	-1
I usually love Melissa and Doug , but these blocks are below their usual standards . The pictures are warping . Was disappointed with the quality of the sounds . Both the blocks and the base are heavy so if your child is into throwing things I would n't buy this for safety reasons .	-1
The toy is really not too impressive . My son played with it for maybe a week and put it on the side . Not really something I would spend 50 dollars on and the hose is a joke .	-1
My boys actually never played with these , even to use as building blocks . They are well crafted , and neatly designed , but they are very heavy with sharp pointy ends on the square pieces . Perhaps they would be good in a classroom `` store '' role play setting , or I have seen museums that have grocery stores and kitchems set up for kids to role play in .	-1
There is n't enough of the sticky stuff to use on all the stars . They do n't seem to glow for very long .	-1
I got these to hopefully help the kiddos sleep at night as kind of something to stare at and fall asleep . Well - they dont glow very well ... if at all . If we shine a flashlight on them for quite a while they 'll glow for maybe 5 minutes . Yeah - I bought two packs of these and am pretty disappointed . Oh Well !	-1
The figures are poorly made , glue is caked on , I would not recommend these . 4/4 Melissa & Doug items we ordered for xmas were cracked or had paint peeling . We 're staying away from this company from now on .	-1
I purchased this set to go along with the Melissa and Doug Wooden Castle - very disappointed in the quality of this product . The glue is squished ( hardened ) out of the joints and their clothing is cheaply made . My children did n't seem to notice but I surely would n't buy them again .	-1
Do not waste your money on this one -- too many other nicer horse options out there . The horses are cheap fuzzy creatures . More effort by the manufacturer was put into the wood container that holds the horses but it is not a fun way to play with the horses anyway . My daughter put all the horses in a barn yard house she has and never looked at them again !	-1
We got this for my horse-crazy daughter for Christmas . Barely played with it and one of the horses needs some super-glue attention . I do n't know how it happened , but she is very good with her stuff and mostly has been just lining them up on a table and making them & # 34 ; talk & # 34 ; to each other . I expected more in the way of quality .	-1
My 3 year old daughter really has enjoyed this set of horses but maybe a little too much . Unfortunatley they are not super sturdy and the legs have been easily ripped off and hair pulled out . We ended up getting a set od sturdy , simple plastic ones and they have fared much better .	-1
My daughter begged for this in the store . She loves her Leapfrog videos and loves letters , books and writing so it seemed like a good choice and I got it for her without reading the reviews . She has had it 4 months and has played with it about twice . That is probably the worst dollar to playtime ratio we 've had with any toy . She liked tracing the numbers a few times to make the bear laugh , looked at all the books once , did n't like how the books are read to her ( kind of mechanical or robotic pacing ) so abandoned them . She seemed like the ideal kid for this toy and it was just a total bust . I just read the reviews for the Leapster and I REALLY WISH I had read the reviews for both products before : I would have bought the Leapster instead and my daughter could have practiced her writing with crayons.I gave 2 stars instead of 1 because -- despite its total lack of interest -- the system worked just fine the two times it got used .	-1
I bought LeapPad Plus Writing on impulse at the store , wanting to help my son with writing , phonics , etc.He used it a few times , but I almost have to beg for him to use it ... and that 's sad . I wish I would have gotten the original LeapPad or perhaps even the Leapster.For one thing , the book does n't recognize all pencil movements . A child could make an incorrect number or letter , and it does n't seem that the LeapPad would recognize it . Also , the child has to keep erasing over and over , providing limited usage.Not only that , there are only a few books published with LeapPad Writing in mind , and the exercises are repetitive ( e.g . writing the number 6 ten times ) .I 've bought quite a few LeapPad books and Quantum Pad books for my son , and he is just not interested after initial use . I 'm sure he 's learned a little bit of phonics using the phonics books and such , but I think he learns more from workbooks bought at a bookstore or a department store -- and they 're cheaper ! Not only that LeapPad books are very short ... much shorter than workbooks you can buy.Considering that LeapPad books are usually around $ 15 a pop -- and that Amazon does n't carry/list them all and there is a VERY limited selection in Stuff Mart-type stores ( at least , that 's the case in my geographical area ) -- you may want to re-consider investing in the LeapPad system .	-1
Super super cheap ! My 20 month old broke the top off it literally 5 seconds after I gave it to her ! Thankfully I can pop it back on but it is a pain . I do have to say she enjoys it though . I thought there would be more of an echo .	-1
I was looking for a mic for my 3 year old . This does not have an off/on switch . It has a fake button . It is not a real mic . It just allows the child to hear their echo . And they will have to put their mouth practically on top of the mic . Maybe a fun toy for a 1 year old . Would not recommend for older toddlers . Go to Lakeshore Learning for a better mic .	-1
I am so disappointed in this microphone . You ca n't even choose your color . They sent me purple for my little boy . It barely echoes . Not entertaining at all . Do n't waste your money .	-1
The mike is a lot bigger than I expected & I do n't hear much of an echo . My daughter does n't care for this toy .	-1
In order to get any echo whatsoever you have to really yell into this and then you ca n't hear it anyways because you have to yell so loud . I got it as a fun Xmas gift for my 17 month old . No wires , no batteries . Thought he would love it . It 's pretty much a piece of crapola . Already at the bottom on the toy chest !	-1
I knew what to expect when buying this thing , because I had one when I was younger . It 's not a microphone but more of an echo chamber . It can be fun to play with for a minute or two at a time . Mine was broken , though , when I received it and it was not worth the effort to return it , so I would suggest not buying this online but rather in a store - you also get to pick the color you want that way .	-1
Pretty much nothing . Very little echo quality . Would not recommend . Tem more words required.six , five , four , three , two , one . none .	-1
First make sure you understand that the blue sheet you see in the photo is NOT part of the tent . The tent sits AROUND the bed so you use your child 's normal sheets . It has strips of material in the corners to keep the tent on top of the bed ; they are n't perfect , but they work . And children can still fall out of this tent , it 's not really secured to the bed . However , because I researched this product I knew this in advance so that 's not the reason for the 2 stars.I ca n't give it 5 stars because it is WAY over-priced and poorly ( misleadingly ) advertised . I can buy a full size/outdoor/water proof tent for 3 people that includes a floor , rain-fly , zipper enclosures and tent stakes for about the same discounted price ( WAY less than the $ 86 retail price of this tent on the mfg site ) and the material would be about the same quality . So the markup on this product has got to be high . However , I found no other company selling full sized bed tents so I really did n't have much of a choice ! ..which is probably WHY it 's so expensive.It went up quick and it is decently constructed but the opening is Velcro NOT zippered as listed . The mfg does n't mention either way but the photo is the same which does NOT match the actual product . The door does n't open the full length of the bed either as pictured by other people and ads I 've seen . Maybe the twin still has the full opening and a zipper or maybe it was a recent change and the ads have n't caught up , or maybe I got an old model tent ? ! Who knows , but there is definitely misleading packaging here and poor descriptions all over so I have to ding them a few stars . It appears to me that the photo used on the double product is the SAME as the twin product ( and looks like the twin model ) .And one last note..with an opening that does not go end to end like shown in the photo , the Velcro straps that are there to hold the door flaps open are totally USELESS . Thankfully I had some adhesive backed Velcro on hand I could stick to it so the doors now stay open.Bottom line..I would recommend another product if there were one , but given no other choice ... If your kid likes tents as much as my daughter then go ahead and buy it . It 's not a BAD tent ... just a definite candidate for the phrase `` Caveat emptor '' . I will also note I bought mine through Walmart because it was cheaper . So if anybody orders the one shown here at Amazon AFTER 5/2013 please comment as to whether our not yours has zippers and opens the whole way because quite frankly that was my main factor in dinging it below 4 stars . The last star is the price .	-1
I ordered this for my 18 month and 3 year old daughters . I get that the title says mini but I was really surprised how small it was . The top did n't sit on the box properly and the peg maze did n't move fluidly at all . It was like it was made by child labor in a third world country and passed off as a nice educational toy . I returned it the day it arrived . Really , this thing is almost a joke . I truly ca n't understand how anyone could give this a good review . It 's just terrible .	-1
I love the design of this toy and so does my son . BUT , I sent the first one back because one of the crews was stripped and kept turning . I sure did n't want it to fall out one one and my son finding it . It had some paint marks on the inside and piece of wood on the inside was broken . Then , I got a replacement one that has one screw stripped once again and the 4 screws to screw the top were missing altogether and of course more paint on the inside . Made in China with lots of paint which also makes me nervous . Their quality control sucks , I ca n't believe that two out of two products are both defective . I feel bad for Amazon paying for shipping back and forth to send me new and will keep the second one , but will NOT purchase any more products from Anatex . This toy cost around $ 100 and for this kind of money , I expect quality . And this product is not quality .	-1
This product is lame . It is not worth half of what it cost . It is exactly what you see , so the whole ugly display is on your back seat , not just the pictures . There is this stupid sticky velcro strap that it hangs from . All this is , literally , is a piece of posterboard with 4 zipper baggies attached , and a sticky velcro strap that you loop around your head rest . The pictures are great , and my daughter is mildly interested in them , but you could print similar images out for free and stick them up .	-1
I loved this , my baby loved this . Well , we did until it fell apart due to the heat in the car . Where I live it can get up to 100 degrees in the summertime . The heat melted the adhesive that was holding the Velcro strap to the back of the picture holder . The heat also shrunk the plastic , so it got wavy where the picture cards go . They could have at least used something other than a sticky glue for the construction . I realize the price point is fairly low , but come on , I would assume if you use this , you are going to keep it in the car , it would be a pain to remove all the time , so therefore it should be more impervious to the heat . We brought the now-useless-for-the-car item inside and figured we would let our daughter play with the cards . Well , that failed , too . She put them in her mouth , as many babies are prone to do , and the cards disintegrated in her mouth , completely ruined . I am really disappointed in this product because my daughter really did love looking at it in the car . The picture cards are double sided and it comes with a decent number of cards . The cards are fun to look at . But the durability is beyond disappointing !	-1
We recieved this as a hand me down when my son was 7 months and really into standing up , he is now 10 months old . It is not sturdy enough for him to pull up on , he always pulls it down on himself . Currently it is in a corner in the play room with the wheels locked . My son does like to stand and play and push the buttons . Sometimes he pulls on it and falls backward because even in the locked postion the wheels move a little . I have unlocked the wheels a couple times but my son pushes the toy and it seems to go faster than him and he falls on his face . Maybe it will be better when he is a little older .	-1
I would NOT recommend this product to anyone ! ! ! The sounds and voices are overstimulating , have no off switch and are ANNOYING ! ! It goes off when NOBODY is around the toy . The stand is quite unstable and can not hold my daughter 's weight , and she 's NOT a heavy baby by any means . The support beams can not be locked into place . They fall apart when this toy topples . The wheels have ZERO resistance even on carpet . The brakes do not work . My daughter plays with it for about a minute and then finds something else to play with . The spanish language key is good -- which it spoke simple sentences and helped them count NOT give animal noises .	-1
I bought this & we liked it but one day my toddler put it on his little fisher price music table and went to bed . The next day I picked up the ball and noticed black marks on it . I looked around and noticed it had eaten the paint & some of the piano keys off ? I stored it in the closet to show my husband when he got home & where it touched the wall it peeled off the paint ! I 've never seen anything like it . It 's in the garbage now because I do n't want my kid touching it but what the heck is going on with it ? I want why it peels paint off everything & how could this be safe for children ?	-1
It looks awesome and great idea if it only actually changed colors like it shows . I held my hand on it for over a minute and it was just barley changing ... It does n't hold air for long either sorry not worth the money at all . this was expensive for a ball and it was not at all what was expected will not recommend or purchase	-1
Most reviewers here were writing only about the leapster and not about the case . My friend has a case . Fortunately I examined hers before buying one . I am glad I did not buy it . The case is soft and readily collapes . It is very poor quality . I wish I could give it 0 stars . The pocket which holds extra cartridges is simply a mesh pocket with an elastic band closure and it is easy for the cartridges to escape.Instead I purchased a small sturdy cosmetic case for eight bucks which works well . My friend ended up throwing hers away and buying a similiar case . Do not buy this , it is not worth the money .	-1
The idea of this game is that the child helps Sponge Bob collect ingredients to create a new secret sauce . The animation is cute , but the games are too easy ( my son is 4 ) and it takes too long to collect the ingredients . Once enough ingredients are collected , the child then gets to play `` kitchen chemistry '' which is not much fun . The child can either guess at the recipe or tap or SpongeBob to get it . Patrick does the taste test and it is funny to watch his reactions , but `` kitchen chemistry '' is just not exciting , interesting nor challenging enough to keep the child coming back for more.In addition to `` kitchen chemistry '' , the cartridge has four other games : '' Counting Claw '' : Has 3 levels , deals with counting change . the child sticks coins into a slot until he has put in the right amount . My son blindly sticks the coins in the slot until SPongeBob reacts . Then he enjoys playing the claw machine game and the wacky prizes that come out . But he learns nothing . `` Conveyor Chaos '' : Very similiar to the bunny game that comes with the leapster system . Done a little better , but not very versatile . `` Musical Garden '' : The child only has to play with assorted sea music until the timer runs out . The child 's symphony is not played back . Music appreciation ? ? Whatever . `` Bubble Scrubber '' : The one redeeming game on this cartridge . Unfortunately it only deals with 4 letter words . And there is nothing to entice the child to try more challenging levels . I did get my son to start using level 3 instead of 1 by playing it with him and now he prefers level 3 . Although I do know the value of repetition , a few more words would be nice.After experiencing First Grade ( which is still my son 's favorite ) , I was disapointed . This game is only mediocore .	-1
We got this for my sister along with the leapster . She loves Dora so we just HAD to get this . My sister 's 6 and maybe she 's growing out of Dora because she tired of this game very quickly and so did I . It was too repetitive and not quite as intersting as the Sonic game we also got . So in comparison , Dora was `` borrr-ing '' as my sister said when she switched to play another game.So even if you child loves Dora , do n't buy this game unless your child is under the age of 6 . I think even the game was made special for kids still learning about up and down and counting and not for kids in school . It really its n't worth it , and not very exciting . Remember to follow the age suggestions when in doubt , that helps . My sister was past the Dora game educational speaking , even if she still loved the character Dora .	-1
This smaller version is cheaply made ... the tray that pops does n't work properly and it does n't always `` pop '' when the time is up . In the side of the game there is a slide out drawer that holds the pieces when not being used . I got all of the 16 pieces in after a lot of jiggling and positioning , then when we tried to open the tray up , it was jammed . My husband had to unscrew the body of the game in order to open up the drawer . The game pieces are very small and it takes a lot of thumb/index finger coordination to insert them into the tray of the game . Overall , not worth the money .	-1
um.. . the timer doesnt work . . . . . . . pretty lame . . . . . .	-1
the button for the timer does n't always work with this game , and the pieces are small enough that they can get lost very easily .	-1
My children ( 6,5 and 2 ) recieved this as a present . I was excited to share the game with them , as I loved this game when I was little . I do n't know if it 's just my lack of dexterity and speed , but 10 seconds does not seem long enough to randomly put these pieces in - and I 'm talking about myself - not my children . My husband had a test 'go ' to see if he could do it . Before he started the timer , he arranged all the pieces in the correct order on the table . Then he started the timer and worked as fast as he could . He lost . Now , that 's not to say that NOONE could do it , but for young children , it seems odd that a game would give them little to no chance of ever beating it . I also have to say ( just as the other reviews mention ) the game does pop up randomly and does not get set very easily . The quality is less than satisfactory . Overall opinion ? I think this small version is going to be useful when the children just want to sit down and put the shapes in , but as a game with actual competition it 's not going to do the job . Therefore , I rate it 1 star and I think I will go out and find an original , big-size Perfection .	-1
Its a game made to be very very quick . I would n't mind if it would give some more time to put in the pieces . It only gives you 10 seconds . My 5 yr old cant do this so quick .	-1
Very very very small Did n't pop out the Peices Like it should timer kept getting stuck but they found a way to enjoy it and its not for 4 yr and under	-1
We just opened this , and after playing it once , the timer is already broken . It wo n't set & the game just keeps popping up . Even though surely they are n't all so easily broken , it 's still really poorly made . It seems more like a dollar store toy than the $ 8 I paid . My kid likes using it to put the shapes in , regardless .	-1
One of the nice features of Infantino puzzles used to be the packaging , but they 've switched from the nice lidded tub shown in this picture b/c our puzzle came in a cardboard box . It 's sturdy but the lid is not easily opened or closed even for an adult ( mostly b/c of the sample puzzle piece attached to the rope handle and the slit it 's supposed to go through being undersized . So basically the packaging is now a throwaway item which is a mistake for a puzzle . Also , the number shape pieces are cut too tightly . We can barely get the pieces together . My almost-2-yr-old can definitely not do it . Maybe they will `` loosen up '' the more we play with it , but I ca n't see us playing with this very often . We have other Infantino puzzles that we really like , purchased 2 years ago . The changes from then to now are very disappointing .	-1
My daughter 's grandparents were here from overseas and they set her loose in a toy store , returning with this carrying case and two other cc items for close to the price of a grocery bill . It 's made of cardboard . No critters are included . You could have the fun of decorating a shoebox with your child and use that instead -- no charge . Try a rubber band and voila ! A latch.Do we play with this ? Sort of . When we play calico critters , she moves them into her Dora playhouse ( picked up free at a thrift shop ) and she moves MY family into this overpriced box for ME to use . Buyer beware ! !	-1
Should have listened to the other negative reviews . My then 17 month old was very interested in these . However , to make them work you sometimes have to smash them together while they are inside the box . One of the animals completely does n't work . Also , the pictures on the cubes are glued on so badly that they are coming off already , after only 2 months of play . Total waste of money .	-1
The sounds are authentic but not very clear and not at all entertaining to a one-year-old . My son also has the vehicle blocks and mimics those sounds happily .	-1
We love Melissa & Doug in our house . We have so many of their products , but this has by far been our worst purchase from them.1 ) Batteries not include . Fine . I should have read the description more carefully . Luckily we keep AAA & AA batteries in the house at all times , so it was n't that big of a deal . This is more of an annoyance - likely amplified by the other issues with the toy.2 ) The horse is two different shades of brown . Drives me nuts , but maybe the baby wo n't notice.3 ) You can barely hear the animal sounds when the toy is laying flat . It annoys the baby to no end and requires me to hold it at a slant and hope the rubber triggers still work properly . Argh ! Now instead of the baby playing happily with his brothers , I 'm stuck holding this toy for him whenever he wants to use it . Do n't get me wrong , I love spending time with the children , but this just was n't intended to be one of those toys for me.4 ) The horse sounds as if it is SCREAMING . It is horrifying . When my boys mimic it , they do n't even try to whinny , they just scream as loud as they can.I would n't buy this toy again , and I wo n't be buying any other products from Melissa & Doug that rely on electronic sound chips . I would have returned it , but I bought it a while ago as a birthday gift for the baby . It 's been on the shelf for months and we only just opened it after his birthday party . I feel cheated and am thoroughly disappointed .	-1
This toy is good in theory . However , it 's quite disappointing when you try to use it . The blocks have to be in the holder just right to get the sounds to work . Then , when you do get them in the right place with a match , you ca n't really hear the sounds . My kids did n't play with this toy much at all . I recently threw it in the trash - that 's how disappointing I found the toy to be . I would not recommend it .	-1
We buy lots of Melissa & Doug toys and puzzles , but this one was really pretty `` cheesy '' and definitely not worth the $ $ . The first one we received was also defective/did n't work . I 've seen much better versions so I would shop around .	-1
Not worth the money . I would not recommend this to other parents . The stickers on the cube are wrinkled so the pictures are skewed . They can not be removed without tearing so you can not reapply them to make them straight . In addition to the wrinkled sticker the sounds of the animals are off and a bit creepy . I would not say my child thinks & # 34 ; Horse & # 34 ; when they hear the neigh sound of the cube . The animal sounds do not always work and you have to jimmy the cubes around to get the sound to come out . On the positive side , the cubes are large and sturdy and my toddler has an easy time fitting them into the tray .	-1
My sons teacher has a cookie jar that looked JUST like this one , except it counted each cookie out load as you put it in the jar . Since this cookie jar is identical to the one his teacher has I bought it thinking it was the same one . But no , this is just a cookie jar with cookies in it , no electronic counting . We were very disappointed when we opened it and realized it was not what we expected .	-1
My son is two years old and can already count to 10 , but I thought he would have fun putting cookies in the jar and having it make noise . This toy makes no noise at all , its simply a cheap plastic jar and ten cheap plastic cookies . The cookies are so flimsy that you can bend them in half . For nearly $ 20 I feel this toy is a rip off . Save yourself the $ 20 and draw your child out 10 `` cookies '' made out of paper and turn a coffee can into a `` cookie jar '' - it will have just as much educational value and will likely last as long .	-1
I really like other products by this company ( the rainbow color cones are awesome ) , but these were poorly made . They were hard to pull apart and put together , but most importantly , the little plastic injection molding nibs had not been cut off and there were sharp parts that could scratch little hands .	-1
This cupcake set smells awful ; Whether it 's PVC/vinyl or other kinds of awful chemicals , I actually became nauseous after opening these from the horrendous smell . They are extremely difficult to put together/take apart , and both of my daughters ( and myself ) are frustrated by this . I 've been looking forward to this set becoming a part of our play kitchen , and now I 'm a bit afraid to let my daughters play with this due to the awful smell ( yes , I washed the pieces as instructed -- they still smell ) . I would return this set , but it 's too much of a hassle with amazon . 2 thumbs down : - (	-1
I thought this would be fun for my two-year old as she , of course , loves ice cream but I never gave her a chance to check it out . The scoops of ice cream are a weird rubbery material and it felt really weird in my hand . Smelled funny to . Also , they were difficult to fit on top of the cones . So I returned it and we are using our imagination instead when we play ice cream shop and make our cones out of Bristle Blocks ( which I highly recommend ! ! )	-1
But nothing really works , not even the stethoscope which would be the easiest thing to work , right ? It 's disappointing . I would n't buy it . It 's not worth the money .	-1
I got this for my daughter for Christmas based on all the reviews . I wish I would have bought another set . 1. the blood pressure cuff broke day one . 2. there are so many parts to it I wish they would have made fewer ones but better quality , everything feels very cheap . 3. my daughter pinched her finger on the case . it is not the easiest to open . My daughter is almost 4 so it cant be that she is too young . I should have bought another kit .	-1
The blood pressure cuff snapped the first time my son played with it , it 's made of cheap plastic . The stethoscope does n't even really work , it 's just a cheap noise maker that makes unrealistic fake heartbeat noises . There are no compartments for the toys , they all just get thrown into this plastic container when the child is done playing with it.For the price , the quality of this product is very poor . It 's all cheap plastic and breaks easily .	-1
I wish I had n't purchased this toy . IT IS A 2-WHEEL CONFIGURATION-NOT A TRICYCLE OR 4-WHEELER . It tips over very easily when they pick up their feet to push . My daughter fell over and hit her head on the wall . Right now it resides in a closet.It says for 1-3 yr olds . My daughter is average height . At 20 months she can still just barely reach the floor . I called Step-2 and they told me this is intended as a & quot ; walker & quot ; toy-not a ride-on ! ! I do n't know what value this toy could possibly have in teaching a child to walk . Besides , most 1-3 yr olds can already walk.This toy is really cute and maybe if your child has NEVER been on another ride-on toy then maybe you could teach him to use this one -- well supervised . I 'm returning ours .	-1
I regretted this thing before I even finished putting it together . The assembly is somewhat intensive , requiring tools and muscles , and if you do n't follow the minimal , ambiguous , visual directions exactly right the first time , you will ruin it . This toy is cheaply made and badly designed . I bought it for my 18-month-old who is jealous of his older sister 's bike , but the wheels are too cheaply made to be useful outside . Although this bike fits him , he does not ride it , perhaps because the front wheel does not turn and the wheels do not roll easily and smoothly . His four-year-old sister , on the other hand , enjoys scooting it around the house . Go figure .	-1
No really ? Why did I bother buying this ? What a brilliant idea , give the kids a hammer and encourage them to bang on things with a wooden mallet . There is no storage place for the hammer and the balls roll out of the box or have to sit precariously on top of the toy when not being played with . I also found that my son got bored with it quickly and he ( thankfully ) stopped using the hammer and just pushed the balls down . He then got bored with even that and now just plays with the wooden balls . Wooden balls are fun , until they 're thrown or banged on something : floor , table , pots and pans , your older child ... the list is endless . It 's unfortunate too , for the amount of money I was hoping for something he would play with longer and enjoy more . The toy has held up , even after endless banging . Or rather the balls and mallet have . The box part has been put to the side and forgotten about but it has a very thin particle board ( ? ) bottom , with heavy use I do n't think it would have held up . Overall , I 'm very disappointed and unimpressed with it . We 've had it for about 9 months and will be selling it soon .	-1
My son loves anything to do with drums , but he really is n't into this toy . I think he 'd like it better if it came with two drumsticks instead of only one . Also , I find it interesting that the drum is cut to make three different tones , but the choice of tones is off-putting .	-1
Mine arrived looking like a refugee from a war-torn African nation . The hair is coarse , spiky in places , falling out , mixed with a thread that is coming out from under his chin , and glued stiff around the eyes . The glue around his eyes scratches and is obvious . A mesh fabric flap juts out from under his chin . It looks like crocheting fabric . Just a horrible toy . What a waste of money . NOTHING LIKE THE PICTURE SHOWN .	-1
I ordered one of these and got the right colors.I ordered another one and received a GREY Cat in the Hat.I AM VERY DISAPPOINTED ! ! ! ! !	-1
I bought this as a possible favor for my 6-year-old son 's Spy Training sleepover party , thinking it would be fun for the boys to run around with in the dark . But , it is tiny ( about the length of my thumb ) and really more like a red light than anything else . As someone else mentioned , you can see very little through the `` lense . '' My son used it for a couple minutes as a `` laser , '' and then abandoned it . For a couple dollars more , we are going with the Night Vision Goggles by the same company , which are actually binocular-sized and have many more features .	-1
After having my home overrun with puzzles put together by my teen and me , I began searching for puzzle glue to keep the puzzles together . In my search I tried three types of glue suggested for use with puzzles : Save-A-Puzzle Glue by RoseArt , Mod Podge CS11302 Original 16-Ounce Glue , Matte Finishand this , Puzzle Conserver . Of the three , Mod Podge CS11302 Original 16-Ounce Glue , Matte Finishis hands down the best all around.TheSave-A-Puzzle Glue by RoseArtcomes in a small container and is easy to apply . It goes on clear and dries clear . After application and allowing to dry I was able to pick the puzzle up and move it without any problems . The only con is the container is small for the price.TheMod Podge CS11302 Original 16-Ounce Glue , Matte Finishcomes in a large container and is easily applied with a small foam brush that you have to purchase separately . A 16 oz container is approximately $ 8.00 at the local big box store and will cover many puzzles . Once applied the puzzle is completely glued and will not come apart.ThePuzzle Conserverdoes not hold puzzles together . The glue was applied evenly although it did not go on white , as the product indicated , to make application easier . It left a beautiful finish but after drying and trying to move the puzzle began coming apart , and this is the most expensive of the three . The foam applicator bottle is great but the product itself just does not work .	-1
Very disappointed in this toy . First , it did n't every work right . We put the batteries in , but the remote never worked properly . Second , you are supposed to use the controls in the top portion , but it seemed they were programmed backwards , and in essence , only made the car scoot a little bit and in the opposite direction you thought . Finally , the top when put on is very durable , so my daughter can carry it around , but when she tries to take it off , it is very hard to do for the small kids . Overall , I would not buy this at all for anyone .	-1
I do not recommend purchasing this product . Its more frustrating than fun since you have to stand so close to the car for it to work . And , the remote control never fits back onto the car . I want my moola back on this one . Argh .	-1
I was searching for RC cars for my now 4yo and saw this and ca n't believe it 's still on the market . We had this last year and it lasted for less than a month . Although it 's a solid toy , it just has no longevity , no matter how often you replace the batteries . The rare moments it did work , my kid had to practically stand on top of the car for it to move . Buy a different RC instead , this one is only fit for trash day .	-1
These wo n't stay on my son ever . The fabric is super soft , which you would think would be awesome . However , the soft fabric causes these to not stick to the skin , meaning they slip right off in the water no matter how tight they are . I suggest buying & # 34 ; Stearns Kids Puddle Jumper Deluxe Life Jacket , & # 34 ; which is a must own product if you have little swimmers .	-1
Set up took about 20 minutes , cars make it once around the track but fly off of the track if wound up enough to try to make 2 laps . I suspect it will be played with for a week or so then discarded . A shame .	-1
OK , we got this for our son when he was 18 months old and it was way too high for him to ride ( even on the lowest setting ) . He 's now 2 and his feet still are n't reaching the floor . How annoying . And friends of mine have this and have the same problem . So , it just sits there most of the time .	-1
This is not a very good choice for your child . First of all it is not sturdy and is poorly constructed . It is cheaply made which really surprised me as I love Little Tykes stuff ! I bought 2 of these for my twins 1st B day and ended up returning them both after opening one and putting it together .	-1
I wish we picked a different set of play food - these are not well-crafted toys that will last you for a few years . My daughter is pretty gentle with her toys , but the paint on the play food in this set was already coming off a few weeks after opening it . Paint rubs off onto the other pieces of food , chips off the food and the wood gets nicked easily . Our watermelon piece is especially trashed , the paint has started coming off in chunks ( a concern when we have a baby crawling around our home , too ) and there 's a huge crack down the middle.They are poor quality , but cute and child-sized , perfect for a child 's hands - I do n't get why other reviewers are complaining they want play food that 's realistically sized - you want a toy fish or a steak or a watermelon or a milk carton that 's proportional ? I 've never seen play food that 's not in a child-friendly , mini version . It would n't even fit in a child 's play kitchen otherwise ! If you are thinking of buying because of the `` Made In USA '' standards the Melissa and Doug brand has proudly advertised for years , do n't be . Most of their toys are made in China now .	-1
This is a very weak alternative/and or addition to Melissa and Doug 's Playtime Fruits and Veggies . The items are not life-size and in some cases unrecognizable . The little wooden boxes are nice for storing and would work better for a smaller play kitchen . However , the play food items are not life-size and in some cases unrecognizable . If it had not been opened , I would have returned it .	-1
We bought our almost 2-year-old son toy food from Melissa & Doug for Christmas and his birthday a few weeks later . Unfortunately , this food group set was the one item that we really were n't happy with . The reasons why we do n't like the food group set as well asMelissa & Doug Playtime VeggiesandMelissa & Doug Playtime Fruitsare:1 ) The paint chips off and gets nicks and scratches . After only 4 months of use , many of the pieces had a lot of wear to the paint , looking visibly beat up , and we do n't currently have any young ones that like to put toys in their mouth . I ca n't imagine how much paint would come off if a child were to gnaw on it ! 2 ) This set is wooden . The pieces feel much more artificial and are stiff and cold compared to the fruit and vegetable sets which are made of a durable plastic.3 ) These pieces are not life-sized , especially the fruits . The banana is barely any longer than the onion is wide . This makes them less educational . By contrast , the fruit and vegetable sets are life-size.I would not recommend buying this toy food set , and I would be leery of any of Melissa & Doug 's wooden food ( and unfortunately that 's what most of their food is ) . I would , however , very highly recommendMelissa & Doug Playtime VeggiesandMelissa & Doug Playtime Fruits .	-1
I run a daycare and we are trying to reduce environmental toxins ( including plastic ) . I am replacing all plastic toy food with wooden ones . I purchased wooden play food from Melissa and Doug , Hape and Plan toys.The Melissa and Doug set immediately started chipping- the & # 34 ; hamburger & # 34 ; came with bubbled up paint . Within a couple of minutes of being played with for the first time , the paint peeled off , revealing a thick , white , powdery substance underneath , that came off on the child 's hands . What is the powder ? I do n't know because when I emailed M & D ; a couple weeks ago to ask , no one ever responded ! Only the hamburger is totally destroyed , but I think it is safe to assume that if one toy comes apart within minutes of use , the rest of the set wo n't last long . I have had no problems thus far with the food from Hape or Plan Toys . We have other toys from M & D- ; puzzles and such that are ok . However this toy was so low quality I am hesitant to try another of their products . We asked for an exchange- we will see if this was a fluke or not . I see that many other reviewers have had paint issues as well , though .	-1
Great idea for a toddler toy but the microphone breaks or cracks when trying to work . We use the volume but it still seems loud . This toy need improvements because it 's another cute toy !	-1
This is a favorite toy among my children ages 2-6 . I thought it would be a great toy to bring in the car so they could play with it while waiting . BAD idea , it is so loud , I can barely hear anything else . Otherwise , it 's very durable ( we have 7 children ) , it 's lasted through being dropped , stepped on , fought over , etc . I put a pc of tape over the speaker , which has helped a little , but now the younger one ca n't play with it ( she eats the tape ) .	-1
I am a big fan of educational toys but I believe there are much better ones on the market . This toy is loud and obnoxious . I agree with the reviewer who felt the screen was dark . I also feel that it is hard to manipulate . Also , the quality is not what I would expect from fisher-price . Even after a battery change , the screen refused to advance . Returned to the store within days .	-1
The good : My 18 monnth old son plays with this toy for a while , loves the music , and has favorite `` pages '' with each cartridge . Ours does have a volume control , so the `` low '' volume is n't bad at all.The Bad : The microphone stopped working within 3 weeks , the screen is really dark , and the pages get `` stuck '' if the batteries are low.All in all , there are better toys out there ... can anyone say My first Leappad ?	-1
I purchased this toy for my 3 year old daughter at the time who has learning disabilities but LOVES music , so I thought it would be great ... She LOVED playing with it with her sister up until about a month or so of owning the toy and the microphone breaking..Replaced batteries several times and did n't do any good..Still a broken toy with a great concept and would be wonderful if it worked properly ... It was a waste of money spent on a toy in which I no longer had a receipt for which went straight to the trash ... .	-1
I purchased this for my 4 year old 's birthday based on all the positive reviews . After I purchased 4 D batteries , I put the thing together , with a very eager 4 year old by my side . What a bummer it was to have it put together , and have it do hardly anything . The baseballs were very , very slow to come out . Not to mention this toy is LOUD ! But back to the actual function of this toy . It 's horrible . The balls are slow to come out , if they came out at all . Or perhaps one will come out , but then it would turn itself off . It also appeared to shut itself off if the 4 year old was too slow to add the balls back to it . Overall very disappointed with this , and it 's going back .	-1
I bought this for my 4 year old daughter and it is way too advanced for her . The balls shoot out at 2 different angles to hit but are too fast . She uses the top part as a tee . We ended up going to Walmart and buying a regular tee . She may be able to use this in the future but not right now . It comes with 3 foam balls which my dog chewed up 2 of them right away so now I need to buy replacement ones . Not what I was hoping for .	-1
waste of money really upset that this broke after first use . The idea behind the toy is great just wish they could get their stuff together ... come on fisher price ... every thing I buy from you guys seems to break !	-1
I bought this toy to keep my 6 month old entertained in the car . She did n't seem interested in it except for the toy that was attached . Sometimes when you press the horn , it does n't go off . Other times the slightest little nudge will set it off . Sometimes every bump I hit on the road would keep setting it off . It was a little anoying . Also there should be more of a variety of noises .	-1
I bought this toy for my 4 month old to occupy him on long car trips . It was SO annoying to attach to the car seat , and it did n't sit on his lap so he could n't even see it . The music is annoying . One of the settings is for `` soothing '' music but it sounded the same as the non-soothing music to me . As for durable , forget about it . I had this toy for less than 3 months , with VERY limited usage , and now it does n't work at all . I replaced the battery and it still does n't work . It was a waste of money . I would have been better off just getting one of those toy bars .	-1
My son has never been interested in this toy . It is a pain to affix to his lapbelt in the carseat and I could n't get the remote to affix anywhere in my car either . When I tried letting him play with it in the house , he would n't go near it . This was a great idea for a toy ( with the remote ) , but it 's essentially a big pillow that sings the same , repititive song with a little stuffed animal attached to the side ( which is also too hard for babies to pull off ) . There 's nothing for baby to do except press the center ( you have to press fairly hard ) , and that gets old quickly ! If you can find it used somewhere for under $ 10 , great ! Otherwise , save your money !	-1
This was a gift from a family friend . It di n't attach to the carseat properly therefore placing it on my daughters laps just made her mad and she would kick it into the floor . I DID like the remote ... .when it worked . And the music ... well ... could of been better .	-1
The basket is poorly designed . My 18 month-old son easily takes it off . It would be better if it were designed like the Kettler bell and could n't be removed just by pulling on it .	-1
This IS a review system so that people can see others experiences with a particular item BEFORE buying it . I think you forgot that part . I rely on this and If ppl were not truthful , it totally defeats the purpose .	-1
This toy is made up of 2 islands attached by a bridge . One one island , there is a palm tree ( when you pour water into the palm tree , swiper 's face can be seen through a knot hole ) , and there is a tether to anchor the boat to the island . On the second island , there is a slide that dora , diego and boots can slide down.I agree with many of the other reviews that knock this toy for it 's lack of durability . First , the palm tree is n't attached to the island , so it keeps falling into the water . Then the leafy part of the palm tree does n't stay attached to the base of the tree . The boat tether does n't hook into the boat well , so that basically does n't work at all . The bridge does n't stay on , so the 2 islands keep floating away from each other.About the only things we kept from this toy are the boat , the characters and one side of the island to use the slide.Luckily I got this on clearance from a toy store that was going out of business and paid next to nothing for it . This is not a great toy - and not much fun .	-1
We bought this for our son to play with . He loves Dora ... and we were excited at first , but that went away quickly . This thing falls apart ! We ca n't keep the two islands connected , they keep coming apart , and the tree does n't stay in the stand . And in ours , Swiper is n't seen very often . He does n't spin around the way he 's supposed to when we pour water in it . Very disappointed .	-1
It was cool on the stand in the store . Our daughter stopped using it after 1 month . She hated it . I wish we bought a regular bouncer seat instead .	-1
My son has had this toy since he was 1 month old . We 've tried introducing it several different times . Everytime he will quickly loose interest and get cranky . The music is also quite loud . He is now 8 months old and this toy is collecting dust in the corner . Definatly not worth the high price .	-1
My daughter has had this since she was about 3 months old , she is now 17 months and she still does n't like it . It 's setup so that the off setting is between two other settings , so , when I try to turn it off , the switch just slides right over the off setting . I push it back towards off and it glides right over again ; I have to do this quite a few times before I can finally turn the thing off . What makes it worse is that this annoying circus-type music is playing the entire time . When my daughter was a few months old , she would lay there and look at it for a few minutes until it truly annoyed her . The only reason she would kick was because she would get so frustrated and eventually kick while starting cry . The only thing that would get her to calm down was turning it off - well , I already discribed how difficult that task is ! Now that she can play with the removable balls , she totally disregards the toy and takes the balls to other areas of the house . It 's as if we paid over $ 30 for a few colorful balls .	-1
I asked for this toy for my second child becasue my oldest had a similar kick toy ( no longer on the market ) that she loved so much , she wore out the motor ! Well , this one was such a disappointment . It has little footprints which imply that if you kick there , the music will play , but if you kick it anywhere or simply bump into it , the music starts - this totally defeats the `` cause & effect '' educational value to the toy . The dangling toys are too far away for the baby to reach and do not move easily or do anything when kicked . The baby tires of it and rolls away from it after about three minutes . I was hopeful that it would become worthwhile after I transformed it to a sitting-up toy , but like others have said , it is hard to get the balls and basically just frustrates the baby .	-1
Wish I would have read the reviews here before buying . I was tempted to return it also . I got this when my daughter was two months because a friend recommended getting a toy she could kick . Well she kicks it alright but the thing never responds . I even called customer service thinking something was wrong with it . I had to smack the thing really hard to get it to work . The fisher price rep told me the settings are different sensitivities but I am not impressed . I am encouraged by the other reviews and maybe she will like it when she is older . She is almost 3 months old now and seems interested in watching the lights on the continuous setting . I would n't recommend this for a newborn as the box suggests . Live and learn .	-1
Well , this toy i THOUGHT was going to be an awesome toy for my 3 month old but instead I found it to be very annoying..After almost a month of having it I still ca n't figure out where exactly you are supposed to kick it to make the music start . It seems like it just goes on & off when it wants to . My son tries to kick the middle part where the `` lil ' feet '' are but sometimes he 'll kick so hard & nothing ( he has a kick & play piano & has no problem & Loves it WORKS much better ... .i would recomend that instead ) while other times he 'll kick it lightly & it 'll go off maybe we bought a defected one ... who knows ? ! But I would n't waste my money on this toy again nor would I recommend it to anyone ... I would have only given it 1 star but MAYBE when my son gets older he 'll like it more ? !	-1
As everyone else , I was so excited to buy this exercise and foot coordinated toy for my son of 2 months . ( I should have read the reviews first ! ! ) I was amazed at how many screws it took to assemble the unit . After taking the time to get it put together I found that it did n't matter where the baby kicked , the music would go off anyway . I let my son have a go at it and even though he was kicking hard and setting off the music , it would slip away from him and then he could n't reach it . And when he was just kicking lightly nothing would happen . I though this toy would encourage him to coordinated his kicking with a reward , but it only made him cry when he would kick and not get a response . THERE ARE BETTER FOOT ACTIVATED TOYS OUT THERE ! ! Do n't bother with this one ! ! I thought Fisher-Price would have a better understanding of what mom 's expect when it comes to their baby 's learning and exercise.When looking for a foot activate toy make sure you find something that rewards your baby no matter how hard or soft they kick , a toy that is activated in the area where the baby kicks , not by vibration like this toy.I am RETURNING this toy and purchasing something else .	-1
I bought this for my daughter at 4 months , because I liked that the toy can grow with her from laying down to sitting up . But I sure wish I had read these reviews before buying it . Like everyone says , the music is very loud and super annoying . When she would lay on her back it was awkward for her to kick straight ahead to hit the base of the toy . She did kick the spinning toys pretty good and that would thrill her for awhile . But even then she could n't stand to play with it for more than 5 minutes tops . Now she can sit , but she is not yet old enough to place the balls in the spinner so they go down the ramps . The only use we get out of the toy now is when we hold a spinning toy in our hands and she bats at it . Certainly not worth the money I paid for it .	-1
I was so excited when i got this toy i couldnt wait to put it together . Well that took forever and when i was done the boys hated the toy ! I had high hopes though thinking they would like it when they were older and we would change the setting , no such luckThe balls are way too hard to get off-When they stop the wheel from spinning it makes a scary noise-They still dont know what to do with the balls-The music goes off whenever the toy gets bumped-Now the toy is being used to hold open the bedroom door ... ... kinda an expensive door stop !	-1
We bought this for my daughter a month ago because she fit into the age recommendation . This toy was basically a HUGE waste of money . I 'm very disapointed in Fisher Price for making such a boring toy . The balls are hard for me to pull off of the wheel so you can imagine how it must be for my daughter . The music is very annoying and one of the attachments already broke . I ca n't believe this thing cost $ 35.00 . I 'm very disapointed and I wish I could return it , but I threw out the box before I gave my daughter a chance to play with it .	-1
We purchased this Elmo for our son this past Christmas , when he was 21 months old , since he absolutely LOVES Elmo , and thought sure he 'd be a hit . HOWEVER , something must be programmed wrong , because in the game section , Elmo asks him to `` hop like a CAT '' , or `` run like a BUNNY '' , etc ... the animals and actions do n't match up at all . I contacted Personalized By R Us online ( the only way I could find to contact them ) about this problem and got NO response at all . It 's ridiculous to pay this amount of money for something that 's going to teach him the wrong actions for these animals . It is cool to hear him say my son 's name , but I could probably count on one hand the number of times he 's played with this Elmo since Christmas . The E-L-M-O Elmo was MUCH more of a hit , and a good bit less expensive too ! ! I would agree with the prior reviewers who commented on the fuzz factor ... that red fuzz is constantly shedding ... and I thought the dog was bad ! Other Elmos that I'v found look more like the Elmo on TV too . Not sure I 'd buy this one if I had it to do over ... .	-1
This is a really cute toy and a good idea . But when you turn the `` page '' it does n't recognize the new animals . It will say the animal that is in that spot when the page is turned the other way . For example the sheep is at the top left when the page is on the left . Then when you turn it and there 's a cat in that spot it still says sheep . I would think this would get very confusing and frustrating for a child who is just learning their animals and sounds . Maybe I just got a defective one ...	-1
First of all , I have to say I am basing this review off of the see n say I had when I was little . I was VERY disappointed when I got this . While the learning aspect of it is still there , it is small and cheesy and just not the same . For how expensive it is , I expected to get one similar to the one they made in the 80s . This is chintsy and should not cost more than $ 9.99 ... I purchased it for almost $ 25 ! ! I kept it because I think it 's still a great way to learn animal sounds , but I am still disappointed .	-1
My one year old keeps trying to like this toy - the potential is there - but he has difficulty holding the toy up and pulling the leaver . When he does have success his little finger inevitably gets pinched between the spinning arrow and the side of the toy . He 's 16 mos old now and pretty much ignores the toy now .	-1
This was one of my favorite childhood toys so my daughter got it for Christmas . Half of the time , no sound comes out , it just spins . Plus it is much smaller and has too many animals .	-1
My daughter has had this toy for about 2 years and has rarely played with it . She does , however , have two of the old `` classic '' see and says that the neighbor kid gave us . The old ones get more play time for sure . The `` quiz mode '' is too complicated for the younger ones . If they do n't know how to answer the question , it will get stuck in that mode until someone gives it the correct answer .	-1
I loved See and Say as a child , and I could n't wait to get one for my toddler . I got this for him when he was 16 months old . If the toy actually worked consistently , it would be great . But half the time , we pull the lever and it just spins without saying anything . We have to pull it just right , kind of slowly , and have it on one of a few select animals , then it will work . When it does work , he loves it . I 'm really disappointed .	-1
LOL ! Everything everyone has said about this toy is true . My daughter LOVES it and is having so much fun with it even though I couldnt get the slide to stay together AT ALL . The top part of the slide stays on fine and the middle sections stay on pretty good but that last section that goes into the pool just wont snap on it just keeps popping off when you try to snap it in . I had to give this toy 3 stars cause my daughter is having so much fun with it anyway . It bothers me much more than her that the slide doesnt work.Infact , I was so upset trying to put this thing together I thought I was just being a moron ... so I called the number on the package ... I told her about the slide not snapping together and shes acting all surprised like I was the only one in the world that ever had a problem with this ... and she said the only thing is that the instructions were printed a little backwards and to try assembling the slide from the bottom up AND instead of sliding into each other try snapping it in ... as Im on the phone with her I keep snapping in with all my might and it keeps popping out ... and she keeps saying - You have to SNAP it in ... and I keep saying IM SNAPPING and its not staying in ... We went on like that for a few minutes ... finally she took my address and I think shes sending me a refund check and I MAY have to send the toy back but she was unsure about that and told me to just hold on to it . Meanwhile my daughter is playing with it as is and loves it . So take this toy for what it is ... its a shame they couldnt make it work .	-1
The slide will not stay together . The pegs for the slots in the front do not fit the pegs on the slide itself . My daughter has me putting it back together every couple of minutes . What a disappointment .	-1
Though Polly Pocket dolls are played with a lot in my house , the Wild Waves Castle was only used once . It is cumbersome when assembled , tippy , and does n't work like it 's supposed to . Because some water splashes from the slides , I put the base in a waterproof tray for play . Disassembled , it just sits there because it 's not worth the trouble to snap it all back together again . This toy is an invitation for a mess of water on your floor and it 's a pain to store .	-1
The slides do not go together as it should - and it 's clearly not a single faulty unit . We 're going to try superglueing it together as our daughter really wants this . Her other Polly Pocket toys in her collection are of much better quality , it seems to be just the slides ... Talk your child into some other Polly POcket item than this one . Or buy glue ahead of time .	-1
If I could have given this toy a Zero , I would have ! We opened it and after several attempts to get the slide to stay together , you ca n't even breath in its direction , thats no joke . We packed it back up and took it back to the store ! I personally dont agree with glueing a toy soooo poorly made , if you dont take it back your not sending Mattel a clear message that consumers refuse to pay good money for such total junk !	-1
Received this product , opened it , filled it with air and immediately the bottom and the green ring began leaking . Then had to go through the hassle of getting all the remaining air back out and cramming it into the small box it came in to ship it back . Very disappointing .	-1
We bought this not for use as a water pool but as a place for our six month-old to practice sitting on her own without bumping her head on the hardwood floors . It was a great idea and worked well until the bottom deflated the second day . : (	-1
As every one else has said this pool is tiny maybe good for 1 or 2 toddlers . Picture on the front is NOT accurate . A 6 year old ca n't go down the slide with his legs out because they hit the wall . My 3 year old hardly fit . Buy a sprinkler for $ 5.00 my kids had more fun with that .	-1
DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT ! The photos are horribly , HORRIBLY misleading . The actual product is *barely* large enough for two toddlers . The idea that two , three , four or five kids can play on it as shown in the photos is about as far from reality as you can get . The slide is useless for kids over 4 , the arch and basket are flimsy for most kids , and the pool itself is barely larger than a bathtub . This really ought to be pulled from the shelves for misleading advertising.Save your money and avoid this product .	-1
Unfortunately , the set that we got did not work properly.The ferris wheel would not attach to the set properly and , thus , caused the whole thing to be a bust.Sad .	-1
My gears ratios do n't line up across the product so it skips and stops instead of running smoothly ( the problem is in the carousel gears ) . Also one of carousel horse fulcrums is too stiff and had to remove it completely for it operate . AND , the ferris wheels kept popping off their anchoring points , had to actually glue them in . Also it is very noisy . My kid liked it for about an hour ... . then has n't gone back .	-1
I was excited about this product , I bought this one and the one with the zoo animals sound.First it work , but then it began to work only when it wanted ... Sometimes one animal work , sometimes 2 , sometimes all of them ... But it 's unpredictable and really frustrated overall ! How do you explain to a 19 month old that the puzzle does'n't work all the time.At the end my daughter was not interested in it at all ... Too bad ! And also the sound of the animals are not really realistic .	-1
For the love of god why isnt there an off switch to this toy.I got on the metro with this puzzle in a bag after receiving it as a gift . The whole time I heard sirens going off . It was horrible , my son does n't care for it either , he takes the pieces out and flings them across the room . That would be great if the sounds would stop too but they do n't . Super sensitive ! If I breathe in the same room the haunting sounds of the puzzle are heard from the toy box ! Pros : Its a puzzle good for learning . Seems sturdy ? I will only buy this to spread the misery to another parent . muah ha ha ! Cons : No Off switch . Super sensitive will go off at ANYTHING ! The sounds are not that great anyways .	-1
I would not recommend this puzzle . Vehicle pictures are just stickers on wood , so not very durable . Sounds are incredibly loud , distorted , and annoying . Also , this puzzle is light-activated , so that if you walk into the room & turn on the light switch , this puzzle sounds off . Which has woken up the kids in the middle of the night , not to mention given me a heart attack ! My kids do n't play with it as much as they do with similar puzzles , I think because they do n't like the noise . To turn off , you need to take out the batteries .	-1
I love Melissa and Doug toys , as does my 2 year old son . But these puzzles are way less than up to par . My son received this puzzle along with two other M & D sound puzzles ( pets and farm animals ? ) for his birthday . They randomly make noises ( even when no one in is the room ) . The sound quality is horrible and the pictures look pretty dated . There is no on off switch so we might just take the batteries out and let him play with them as regular puzzles ( as we are n't really a family that believes that all toys must have batteries ) . Also , it does n't matter what piece you use ( right or wrong ) ... as long as it 's sitting on top of the open spot it will make the noise . So it 's not even like a & # 34 ; reward & # 34 ; for getting the piece correct . It 's basically just a puzzle that makes random noises . I 'm pretty disappointed in Melissa and Doug for putting their name on this . : -/	-1
Great product idea , but the drill does n't work well . We will be returning this product . Very disappointed . It seemed like the perfect gift , but do n't bother .	-1
Product looks cheap . My 22 month old is into the screws/drill etc . It could have been a perfect present for him . He lost interested in a first 5 seconds.Product is flimsy and overpriced for what offered.Product was returned .	-1
I bought this toy for my 2.5yr old boy and he was so excited when he opened it , so we put in the battery and find that the battery door was unable to close as we turn the screw in . But since my boy was anxious to play w/ it , we just tape the door close . He played for like 3 days and got bored w/ it and we put it away ... and totally forgot about the door problem . We even forgot about this toy till 2 months later , we took it back out and let him play ... it works fine except the battery door sometimes open when tape is loose . Then we thought we deserve a new drill since the door would not close from the start , but because it 's been 2 month ... amazon would not allow us to exchange or return = ( Then I contacted the manufacturer , but they would not do anything about it because we bought it through amazon.I 've purchased many things from amazon and never request for any exchange or return and this is only my first time and I 'm very disappointed , this is just poor customer service !	-1
This looks like it would be a great toy . My 3 year old daughter has played with the manual screwdrivers but the power drill is IMPOSSIBLE ! I have spent at least an hour , first unscrewing the tiny little screw to open the compartment to install batteries . The batteries are on a spring so you have to use force to close the compartment . I have now worked very hard to tighten the compartment but , because of the spring , you ca n't get the screw to make contact with the other side . I have tried everything -- duct tape , packing tape , rubber bands , etc . It just wo n't do it . So , even though this has been fun for the manual tools it was way too expensive considering you ca n't use the power drill ( along with having a 3 year old crying because she ca n't use the toy ) . So , big Thumbs down on this toy .	-1
Received this as a gift for our 18 month old , and it really does n't hold her interest at all ( even if I sit down and try to read it to her ) . All she wants to do is rip the book off the holder and try to `` read it herself '' .I will say that the pages are durable , and do not tear . I think the book is a little too advanced for the age groups listed . Possibly 2 or 2.5 yr olds would have a better attention span , and the knowledge to push the graphics to get the audio feedback from the book.One other thing is that every time you turn the page , you have to `` push '' the a green button on the page , so the pad knows what page you are on - I do n't know how good any child under the age of 3 would be with this - so most reading would have to be `` with an adult '' - otherwise - the child just does not get anything out of the book.I personally like the pad ( and it 's books ) and hope that in time , our daughter will get more out of it . Will write an update if she does show interest .	-1
I got this originally for my 5 year old who is now 12 . He played with about 20 minutes then its over and forgotten about . Then we had two more kids , a boy and a girl . Girl is 6 now and boy 5 . Same deal they pretty much think awesome ... .for 20 minutes then forgotten about . It does n't keep kids attention very long . To me it seems like a such a cool toy but the proof is in the pudding as they say and I have now tried it on all three kids and its a no-go , now headed for yard sale or sale online . Very disappointed in , considering the price . Keep your money and keep looking . All three of my kids have loved legos and the little lego action figures . We would have done much better getting legos instead of this . Same for the Roboraptor , we tried it too and for our kids neither one was a hit . If you do decide to try it and your kids do n't play with it much , do n't keep it like I did thinking maybe 'later ' they will play with it more because mine never did .	-1
This never worked right and the Leapster ended up dead shortly after using it . Not sure if it was a problem with the Leapster of the charger , but pretty disappointed either way .	-1
It does make a lot of bubbles , but it leaks bubble solution out and breaks easily . Also , it is hard to clean , and the battery compartment cover is weird and does n't go on the right way . I 've never bought any other bubble machines , but I bet there are better ones out there for not much more than this one .	-1
It 's cheap and you get what you pay for . While working it produces a ton of small bubbles but the quality is horrible . Only thing keeping it from 1 star is it was only $ 10 when I purchased . Seems like the quality has gone down because friends of ours had one that worked for several years , mine only worked for 20 minutes and the it stopped ! !	-1
Found the same device on Wal-Mart.com and in the store for $ 9.88 . That 's $ 5.11 cheaper . They say it 's free shipping but they basically raise the price to cover the difference . I would have given it 4 stars but since I got jipped I gave them one . Its getting frustrating having to double check Amazon 's prices vs. Google Shopping . Then with and without shipping costs.I trusted Amazon to have the lowest prices but now , I have to double check everything now .	-1
Broke after using it twice . This is the reason I always buy prime , it is so easy to return garbage items like this . Should have listened to the other bad reviews .	-1
-- -- PROS -- -- * This thing kicks out a lot of bubbles . I do n't think we were getting 4000 a minute , but there were definitely a lot of bubbles . * It was cheap enough at Walmart that even if it stops working after a handful of times , we still got our money 's worth out of it. -- -- CONS -- -- * You will blow through the included bubbles ( I 'd call it a `` sample '' size ) in about 10 minutes . * Unfortunately , you really do need to use Gazillion Bubbles to get the best results . After we ran out , I tested my own homemade version and Miracle Bubbles and this is my ranking : BEST : Gazillion BubblesOKAY : Miracle BubblesPOOR : Homemade bubbles* It feels and looks super cheaply made ( but what can you expect for a ten spot ? ) . * It sits at an angle so in order for it to work on grass ( without spilling ) you need to set it on a flat surface ( we used an upside down cake pan ) . -- -- OVERALL -- -- Definitely worth the price for a few hours of bubble fun . I have n't yet had any issues with the battery compartment getting wet so YMMV on that ( and I 'll edit if I discover any issues ) .EDITED 4/4/12 : The machine just up and died ( less than two weeks after we bought it ) . I had just put new batteries in and it was working like a champ ... had it on for probably 20 minutes . Went to use it the next day and it was totally dead . Tried new batteries and nothing . Of course , I had just tossed the receipt so I did n't try to exchange it . Lesson learned ... KEEP YOUR RECEIPT . So I am lowering my review from three stars to two stars and I also lowered the durability rating to one star .	-1
my 3 boys loved this but as soon as it got knocked over once the bubble wands quit spinning . now it 's headed for the trash can .	-1
I picked this up because my kids love bubbles . I worked nicely and became a favorite . I think it got the big head , though because it quickly decided it was too good to work . It stopped working properly and began clicking and the wheel turned . It wasted a lot of bubble fluid also . I was upset when it completely stopped working around 4-5 weeks after purchasing . This equated to maybe 10-12 days it was actually used ... If you 're looking for a good , reliable bubble maker , consider 'Amazing Bubbles Bubble Generator ' here on Amazon . It as lasted me near 7 months now .	-1
The gears on our machine disengage with one full rotation and has to be manually rotated . This happened the very first time we used it , very disappointing .	-1
Had high hopes of bubbles all summer long but it myseriously stopped working before the season ended . Could have been the kids breaking it , but I still expected more from a battery operated bubble blower . Took a lot of batteries to get a it going too .	-1
This is a great bubbler when used with the included bubble juice . Unfortunately , the small bottle lasted us all of 20 minutes . But it was a glorious 20 minutes . More bubbles than I expected . It worked awesome.Then we ran out of fluid . I had the foresight to pick up a 2L bottle of Gazillion bubble fluid to use as a replacement instead of another brand ( instructions read : `` For best results , only fill with Gazillion Bubble solution '' ) . Well , it 's been a bust . Lots of blowthrough . The liquid is just too thin . We 're getting 1/10 of the output we saw on first use . Frankly , I feel like it 's a bait and switch . I should n't need to make my own bubble fluid to use it . A major disappointment.In conclusion : a good bubbler with a huge caveat . The solution that 's included is not the same as the stuff you can buy in the big bottles from Gazillion . Another commenter said it needs Gazillion Gold fluid , not the standard stuff . So get ready to experiment with your own .	-1
We bought this last summer and it worked for 2 days and then it would not work no matter what we did.I did clean it after using it both times and I checked the batteries , but it just would not work . Like I said in the title my son loved it for the 2 days that it worked , but it just did n't work long enough . If you 're looking for a good bubble machine that you 'd like to use more than twice I 'd look elsewhere .	-1
I read the reviews on this bubble machine before I bought it and still bought it . I should n't have . It does make TONS of bubbles ( all are the same size ( about an inch and a half ) , ) but the bubble solution only lasted 5 minutes . I was going to order more online , but it 's too expensive . I only used it once and for 5 minutes ! ! = (	-1
Great fun to begin with , tons and tons of bubbles.Unfortunately we have n't had one live more than a week or so - we do n't overfill it , we clean it with each use , we store it indoors , we replace the batteries to verify that is n't the issue , etc.They simply are n't durable .	-1
The machine stopped working only after a few weeks . The little bottle falls over and the sticky liquid spills all over making the use of it very messy and sticky . Sometimes the machine would work and sometimes it would n't so each time i had to change 12 batteries or so just to see if it 's the batteries or something else . i would not recommend this to anyone .	-1
We have an older model of this exact machine that works PHENOMENALLY WELL ! I actually wanted to buy another one just like it so we could have a backup or to use at parties , but could n't find one at the end of the season last year . This year , they are back , but it is awful . It now tilts back a bit which with the weight of the machine inside , makes it tip over backwards , spilling the bubble solution ( which as you know , is expensive , but works great ) . Secondly , it now has little tripod feet on it instead of a solid circular base which the old model had , so it vibrates and `` walks '' off of the ledge or whatever you have it sitting on ... probably the bad design of weight distribution also has something to do with this . Third , it now has a teeny , tiny reservoir which does n't last very long and you have to monitor it to keep filling it so it does n't run out . The old model allowed you to put the bottle upside down for constant flow for at least 15-30 minutes of play time . I loved this feature because I would turn on the bubbles , go cook dinner and my kids were entertained without much maintenance . Oh , and the wands stopped turning within the first 2 minutes of use . I 'm taking this model back to Costco where we purchased it.I am soooo terribly disappointed that they changed the design of this bubble machine because I thought the original was the coolest gadget on Earth and had recommended it to everyone I know . It has brought my two boys so much fun , enjoyment and laughter . ( ages 5 & 2 ) I was checking Amazon to see if it was the same awful model as Costco sold because I wanted to buy a couple for birthday gifts . I wo n't be buying this one .	-1
My 2 year old daughter loves bubbles and received this for her birthday . First off , it takes a tiny screwdriver to remove the battery compartment and this is no easy feat . My husband is a pretty handy guy and the screws became stripped and it was a two man operation trying to get the compartment off to add batteries . ONce this was done we screwed the cover back on and voila - nothing ! The bubble wheel barely turned ( and we put new batteries in ) . No bubbles , major disappointment after my 2 year old daughter stood watching the both of us try to get this danged thing put together for 10 minutes . Half of the bottle of bubbles that we poured in was now a total waste as were the brand new batteries we inserted because it wasnt worth the pain in the butt to remove them . This is going directly back to the store . Dont waste your time on this product . For that matter , I wont be buying any more gazillion products based off of my experience on this one . Booooooooo for cheaply made , but expensive toys !	-1
Returned it . The motor would get stuck and stop turning . Would not even make one full revolution . Vibrates all over the place when it does run . If it 's on a smooth top table , it 'll vibrate in circles till it falls off the table .	-1
I had high hopes for this to work , my Mom as a a wonder bubble machine that works great . I should have followed suit but this was a little cheaper . And Gazillion does have great bubbles , but the machine sucks . It never blew a single bubble out of the machine . I changed batteries twice , let it run for 30 minutes , washed it three times , tried two versions og bubbles . Not a single bubble , not one . Unless you count the ones when I was behind the machine blowing into the stupid thing to make them come out . And even then it was sad . I would not get this or any gasillion machine becuase of how bad this one was .	-1
I bought this for my youngest son when he was 19 months old..he is now 23 months and still wo n't bother with this slow toy .	-1
My daughter almost 1 enjoyed this toy , but it stopped working and it was not rough handled . I like the concept , but it simply is not well made . The lights and sound no longer work and my return window is closed .	-1
What I love about the original stacker is that the child has to put the rings on in the correct order for them to properly fit . With this electronic one , it does n't matter which ring goes on first - the rings slide all the way to the bottom lights and music will go off . I was looking for a toy that would help teach my child about size/proportion and problem solving . This version quickly went into the get rid of pile and I bought the original stacker , which my son loves !	-1
My baby does n't pay much attention to this toy no matter what sounds or lights are going off on it .	-1
I thought this crawling Pooh was so cute in the commercials , I told my mom she should get it for my daughter for Christmas . All the adults around when she opened it thought it was adorable , especially when he turned his head and said `` Hello Baby '' . But my daughter is totally scared of it . We thought she 'd warm up to him as she got older . She 's had him for over 8 months , and she still cries whenever we turn him on . She 'll touch him and even take him out of the toy box , as long as he is turned off . But as far as dolls go , he is too hard to be cuddly to her . The music is so loud and ear-piercing , and the velcro holding his tummy closed is always coming apart . She learned to crawl fine , without watching Pooh as an example . I think the good reviews are from parents who like him , regardless of how their babies feel . Do n't waste your money on this toy .	-1
You have to push very hard to insert the coins . My son is 6 years old and has alot of trouble with it . While struggling to get the coins in , the meter will miscount that particular coin . For example : if you are trying to get a dime in and you have to take it out and try again , then it will register as 20 cents instead of 10 cents . He grew bored with it rather quickly .	-1
My four year old son just loves these plug and play games . He has Atari , Spongebob , Blue 's Clues , et al . I was really excited when this Ms. Pacman game came out because the games on there are great ! Before buying this , I reviewed the online reviews on this website , and to my surprise almost everyone wrote about how defective the game is . `` It ca n't be that bad '' I thought . `` Maybe it takes a little getting used to , but certainly the manufacturer would not have defective games in the field '' .So , I purchased it , came home , got my son very excited about the game . . . and turned it on . The graphics were phenominal , sound was great , etc . Then , I tried to move . This is were the trouble began . The joystick would not move left . It went up , down , and to the right with no problem , however no matter what I did , it would not move left -- -on ANY game.Not just that , but the Pole Position software has a defect in that you simply can not qualify . I would go through the qualifying lap flawlessly , yet could not make it . It would just give me extra time -- but that 's it . Nothing to `` shoot for . `` I personally can not believe that Jaacks does not have a QA department that would assure the quality of it 's products.In nutshell , you are rolling the dice with this game . I would have LOVED to have one that works -- -but just no when you purchase it , you have a 1-10 chance ( per the reviews ) of getting a product that works .	-1
Small and not well made . For the amount of cars we buy these companies should make some well made toys to go with them already.returning .	-1
This car was is too small to play , even for 4-5 year old it is difficult to put a small car in and pull it thru the washer . We bought another one .	-1
I returned this item . It is in no way worth the $ 27 I paid for it . It is very very small - maybe a customer error , but I expected a much larger toy . My suggestion , if you find it cheaper - probably okay , if not , spend your $ 30 on something else .	-1
bought this for my son when he was about 18M . he played with it but he did n't really enjoy it too much . it just kind of sat around . this toy is really hard to move when on carpet , it gets stuck . if you have a very heavy kid , probably around 23+ lbs their weight pushes it down so hard that it ca n't go forward very easily . not a very good toy overall . would n't get again .	-1
i saw this and fell in love ! i thought it was adorable and would be a perfect christmas gift for my then one year old who had been walking for a month , but was still a bit wobbly . she already had the peek-a-blocks table , which she loved , so i thought she 'd love this . she did n't ! she never played with it . not once . maybe because she was already walking she did n't think it was so great to push it around . she was too tall to ride on it well , so it just sat for a couple of months until i packed it up . i still think it 's cute , so i 'm saving it for a future baby . i 'll try introducing it before the new little one is walking .	-1
Arrived for Christmas and discovered that without other sets this set could not make a circle . What a disappointment for a 2 year old.Just wanted the train to go around and the pieces did not form any typ of circle .	-1
Our kids have loved and cherished their Zoe doll . Today we had a lead review of our home and tested some of the kids toys . Zoe tested with an XRF lead tester through the chest registered a possible 81ppm . This might not sound like much but it is sufficient to give a child a blood lead level of 1 mcg/dL , more than enough to cause permanent and noticeable cognitive damage . We tested the eyes first thinking the paint could be lead-based , but they are not . I do n't know if it is Zoe 's clothes or the stuffing inside that has the lead , we did not want to dissect the doll to figure out . I think our youngest daughter will not play with Zoe and for now Zoe will sit on the shelf until we have the heart to throw Zoe out .	-1
Purchased one and it broke the day we received it . The jet engine car in the rear is motorized and pushes Thomas and the other trains around the track - essentially turning you standard wooden into a motorized one . A single fall off of the train table and the plastic portion that holds the magnet to connect to other cars broke . Learning Curve customer service was quick to ship out a replacement unit . But again , the day we received it a similar thing happened and it broke in the exact same place . I think it comes down to poor design . The jet engine is already heavy because it is metal instead of plastic , and then you add in the battery . Would be a really nice addition to the set if not for the poor design .	-1
Like many of the other children mentioned in the reviews , my son loves the jet engine episode . And while he loves this toy , its design is a source of some frustration . 1 ) The on/off switch is hard for my 3 year old to use , in fact , it is hard for adults to use . We typically have to remove the train from the tracks to do it . The button is too small and when it is turned on , it is flush with the rest of the model . 2 ) My son sometimes prefers to use the jet engine without running the batteries ; while there is a clutch to prevent damage to the motor , it would have been preferable if the car could have free-wheeled forward . For a toy as expensive as this one , that 's not asking much . 3 ) The battery compartment screw is made of cheap metal and the head easily strips . The other screws use a triangular head making it difficult to open and repair ( which it will eventually require ) .I am less concerned than other parents about the tendency of the engine to derail ; you can design a track that is foolproof , and it is also an opportunity to learn about the dynamics of pushing something . On a minor note , I would have preferred if the set actually looked like the jet engine in the episode . I know there have been earlier iterations that did so . This version smells of cost reductions.Addendum : the engine stopped running on Day Two ! I used a jewelers screwdriver to get past the screws with the triangular heads and found the culprit : a single hair had wrapped around one of the inner sprocket axles . It is a bit of a mystery how it got in there ; the hair was not wrapped around any of the wheel axles . There is an even chance that this was left over from manufacture .	-1
My 22 month old daughter really likes things with a screw top , my contact lens container for example . I got this so she can have her own thing to play with . Unfortunately this toy is too big for her hands . It 's almost too big for my hands . Too bad as it 's a great idea .	-1
Our toddler just takes the hammer and uses that to hit other toys with it . The hammer has a nice form factor , just the right weight and fits nicely in the hand . But the sliding blocks do n't draw his attention , and if I were a toddler I probably would n't be interested in sliding them through the holes either . This has to do with the way that the hole grip is designed - it is actually harder to make them go through using the hammer , than it is to just push them through by hand . So a clever kid would just take the shortcut and push it through by hand and get bored with it .	-1
I love PlanToys , but my son quickly pulled apart the excavator toy . That was rather frustrating as these are expensive little toys .	-1
My son is obsessed with cars and has the Plan garage , so I thought he 'd love this . However we ran into the same problems other people have mentioned , namely that the back gate wo n't stay closed and the front and back come unhitched constantly . In addition , after about an hour 's use I discovered the wooden piece that makes the back gate had cracked and is now broken . This is going back .	-1
I absolutely LOVE LOVE LOVE Plan Toys and have bought lots of them for my daughter . I came across this set ( did not buy ) and was horrified . I am white/American and I do n't want my white/American daughter playing with figures that portray people of other cultures in stereotypical ways . PLAN TOYS PLEASE THINK before you make and market toys for young , impressionable children . I have never met someone of Asian decent who walks around with their eyes closed . Or for the matter , wearing period clothing day-to-day . This is really , really awful and sad . I am such a fan of Plan Toys craftsmanship that I hate to write a bad review ... but this has got to be pulled from the shelves ! ! !	-1
We love plan toys and now have several components of the plan city . I wanted a mix of people for my son to play with -- not just some white figures that look like him . It is a diverse world.But these look terrible . Why such sterotypical clothing , hair , and costumes . I am not Asian but I could n't buy these for him . I do n't understand . This is a Thai company -- am I missing something ?	-1
Please , stop making Asian people with closed `` line '' eyes ... Really ? This just needs to end . Plan Toys , shame , shame ... I find this very frustrating as well that we can not be represented appropriately .	-1
Our son got this Plan Toys parking garage set as a gift last Christmas . He has had it for about 10 months now and only plays with it on occasion inside the house . ( He got it for his second birthday and was just a little bit young to really start playing with it until the last few months , when it seems to interest him a lot more . ) He has some hotwheels cars that work with it just fine , in addition to the little wooden one that came with it . I have no complaints about the single car - if you read the description carefully , you 'll see that it tells you that you only get one car.I came back to write this review now because the quality is so poor . Like other reviewers , I added this toy to his wish list instead of one of the plastic parking garage toys ( that I have fond memories of from when I was a kid ) because I liked the Plan Toys company and how they do business in such a responsible manner . We thought it would be worth the premium price tag to support that company . When we put it together last Christmas , my husband and I both remarked on how sturdy the wood seemed , how it felt like this toy would last forever and maybe even become a toy for our son 's kids someday . That 's turned out not to be the case.I have now glued the lower ramp back on twice and found it lose again just this weekend . The design is weird - the pegs are on the bottom of the ramp and gravity just naturally works against it so that the pressure of cars on the ramp eventually push the pegs out . This next time I 'll bypass the wood glue and use Gorilla glue on it . I also had to glue the top ramp last spring for the same reason . Most recently , however , the elevator stopped working . It might be hard to tell from the picture/description , but you turn the flat black knob on top to move the elevator up and down . It takes a little more elbow grease than the plastic versions of this toy require to move the elevator , which is n't really a problem for us , but I expect it to work properly . Inside the elevator shaft , there is a simple string mechanism that winds around the top as you turn the knob . Somehow the string has gotten off track or gotten stretched out or something and now the elevator does n't work anymore . This part of the toy came pre-assembled , and there 's no way that I can get to the string mechanism to try and trouble-shoot the problem or fix it without taking the toy apart in ways that look irreversible . It 's pretty worthless at this point.Our son is very small for his age ( almost 3 ) and he is never rough or abusive with his toys . I wish I could attribute the problems with this toy to wear and tear , but the fact is that it 's severely overpriced for what you get . We wo n't purchase any more toys from Plan . I 'd recommend you not purchase this unless you find it on clearance someplace for less than $ 20 . The lesson I 've learned is just to buy the shiny plastic version of a toy like this - the kids like them better anyway . : )	-1
Just really is basic and does n't have the addictiveness that plastic versions have . the rampdoes n't cause racing , too big and clunky..	-1
I really wanted to love this toy . Overall , it is very sturdy and super cute . We had the old version , where the elevator hangs off to the side , which is still being sold in some places . The old version has a bigger elevator - hence the `` It does/does not fit matchbox cars '' confusion . The old version was supposed to have been discontinued in 2008ish but it is still being sold in some places - we just got it , for Christmas 2010.Our elevator broke within ONE DAY.Plan agreed to send me a new part - to their credit they are great about sending parts . In the mean time I set about fixing the old one . It 's not easy getting that black knob off on top , but I managed . Basically there is a tiny piece of plastic under that black knob on top that serves as a clicker - the gear around the spool under the knob clicks against this to make the elevator ratchet up and down rather than slip when you reposition your hand . Without that clicker , the toy is very frustrating for little hands to work.This is not a matter of a child being hard on a toy - it 's a matter of poor design . So if you 're hoping like I was that your kids will be easier on the toy - it wo n't help . I do n't think my kids were rough with this.I tried to replace the clicker that broke off with a bit of a starbucks gift card but it broke shortly , too . ( I had to drill into the dowel holding it , and hold it in place with hot glue ) I tried to find another sort of plastic that would be strong enough to hold up the elevator but not break under repeated stress . I tested the `` cookie cards '' from our grocery store , which also break under repeated stress - as well as milk jug plastic , which seemed less prone to breakage did n't hold up the elevator consistantly ( too thin ) .In the mean time the new part came and I thought I would put it on and see how it holds up while I work on a fix for the old part - well the replacement part was put together backwards ( roof was on wrong ) so it could not be installed at all . And I was down to one day left to return this toy to where I bought it.I ended up returning this toy . I wanted to love it so bad , but the elevator is the best part of the toy , and if that is going to break all the time , no thanks . If I kept experimenting - I probably could have fixed it . I am wondering if Ziplock container plastic might work , or a different design altogether with two soft parts working against each other and relying on friction.I am amazed at how many people report the elevator broke , but they still love it . I sense a little `` I paid a lot , I will love it anyway '' or else wooden toy loyalty mentality here . I bought a wooden toy hoping for long term durability but this was not the case . Overall it 's very sturdy , it 's just the elevator mechanism that is suspect - although a lot of people report their kids play with it just fine even when it does n't click . My kids liked the click . HUGE disappointment . If I can find a used one for cheap , I might give perfecting the elevator another go , but for the price I paid for this , it should n't require major alterations right off the bat . Big let down ! I would really love to know over the long haul how many people still have a clicking elevator . Is there any reason to believe the new design is any more durable ? With the new design , I am wary of them going for that string and grabbing it to see what happens - plus I just do n't like how the elevator is smaller . Even the most hard core of wood loving parents will probably acquire some matchbox cars at some point - it 's nice to have a toy that does n't require such specialized add ons.edit - yes there IS a much older ( 2002 ? ) version of this toy where the elevator rides up and down on a dowel . I have found one . Why on earth would they have discontinued this method in place of the gear and ratchet which seems to cause so much trouble ? I am sure the new way is cheaper but these toys are still pricey and you should get better quality for that price . It 's got ta be cheaper to make it with the dowel in the first place than to send out new elevators and in some cases whole new garages when the elevators break.edit again - I 've developed an unhealthy obsession with this toy . I got another clicky elevator one where the car hangs off the side of the shaft , determined to fix it if it broke again , which it did , in 2 days . I replaced the plastic clicker with a piece of spring-steel corset stay from a shaper I bought for my wedding and which I will probably never see the inside of again . So far , it is holding up well - so if you have a garage to fix , consider giving that a try . You can buy corset stays at most fabric stores .	-1
I thought this would be very educational for my 18 month . . but she constantly hits the buttons without listening to the entire song . All this toy does is play songs . How boring and uneducational is that ! ! ? It is also very loud . I would get this for babies who are just trying to stand by themselves and who are just started to push things . My daughter just might be too old for it already .	-1
Fun toy but awful design ! Why they did n't test out the three leg design before putting this toy out on the market is beyond me . My 8 month old has already pulled it over on top of her three times in the few hours she has had it . She loves it but if we removed the legs it just would n't be the same , nevermind the fact that we would have to break them to get them out . It seems that we will have to bolt it to some kind of platform that she can stand on too so that it wo n't tip over . That 's just too much work for a $ 30 toy .	-1
My 17 month old was playing happily with the table until the Cookie Monster GROWLED at her ! She burst into tears . Then a few minutes later while she was playing with something on the other side of the room it Growled again . Now she is scared to go near it . Add to that the legs keep falling off , the ABC spinner does n't work , and Elmo 's head is a very cheap looking imitation- and this toy is going right back to the store .	-1
I bought this based on the reviews , and because I thought it would be nice to attach to his stroller , or a shopping cart , but I have been disappointed . We have had this since before our son was born . The music is nice , and my son likes the colors and will occasionally walk around holding this by the handle . The big issue is : it is not interactive . The `` feet '' are too short and fat for a small child to hold ( and they do n't do much anyway- maybe a few textures ? ) , and at 13 months our son still can not turn it on or press any of the numbers ( it is very difficult to get the music to play- esp . for the target age group ) . If we turn on the music for him , he likes it okay ( esp when he was smaller ) , but at this age he prefers if he can do that himself . I am just not impressed with this toy . There are much better toys for texture exploration , and you can find other toys that play music on the go . This is one of our toys I would pass on if I had to do it again . HOpe this helps !	-1
I personally love this toy . It 's cute , the music is pleasant and it makes learning fun . The only bummer , and it 's a major bummer , is it 's hard for my child to press the buttons - and she 's 15 months old ! The only one she can easily press is the first button . The rest of the buttons have too much padding in front of them and a small area to press to activate it . It makes her frustrated and upset when she tries to press the other buttons and ca n't . Toys are supposed to be be fun not frustrating . Every once in a while she gets one of the other buttons to work . But I find she does n't play with it very often probably because it 's not much fun for her . I 'm hoping that as she gets older it will be easier for her to work it . I ca n't believe they rate this toy for 3+ months . I hope something positive will come from this toy and she 'll learn not to give up ! = )	-1
My daughter was never able to play with this toy on her on . I got it for her when she was 7 mos old ... she 's now 16 mos old and gave up on it a long time ago . It just does n't work unless I push the buttons for her . Other than that - it 's a really cute toy ! But it 's not made for babies .	-1
Other then the magnet halves being ALL over my house , this toy was not a huge hit . The sounds are great , but it 's hard for little hands to manipulate the magnets into just the right spot to make it work . I found once they were able to figure it out the entertainment value was pretty low and did n't last long.There were only a few facts about each animal and they were pretty basic . The main song is repetitive . I would n't buy this toy again .	-1
I have had really great success with the LeapFrog Leapster educational games ( my 5 year-old has the Leapster 2 ) . So I had high hopes for the 2nd Grade Leapster cartridges since the 1st Grade cartridge was fun and educational . However , my daughter and I had such a hard time physically moving the characters through the game jumps and leaps that we did not move ahead educationally . Even as an adult , I could not get the character to jump to certain clouds ( if you miss/fall , you have to restart that challenge area again ) . Therefore , when you are at a more advanced level of the game , my child can not even reach the next question , even with my help . Very Frustrating ! I would definitely not waste my money buying this cartridge .	-1
Half the pieces were either missing or damaged , emailed company and they did replace and send all the needed parts , exactly what I needed nothing morewas n't easy to put togetherthe mobile is already not workingJust really not as quality as it should be for that price . Plastic would of been better.Do like that is on wheels and has the cabinet underneath though .	-1
Not well-made . The magnetic latch on the drawers broke after two days . It was also difficult to put together as the pre-drilled holes did not match up .	-1
I purchased two of the Badger Basket Doll crib 's for my granddaughters . I think it is beautiful and an item every little girl would like with the pink inserts and the mobile BUT as far as this item staying together it is MADE POORLY ! After putting it together I realized it would not stay that way with any child using it . I took the entire cribs apart and using toothpicks and wood glue began to assemble it back together . I can only hope it will stay together and I will not have to do the process again . If you are not handy and have ALOT of patience I DO NOT recommend purchasing this item .	-1
We 've had this doll crib for almost a year now and it has just gotten worse . It really is heartbreaking because my daughter LOVES this crib . When I initially put it all together , I had a problem even then with the center board ( bed part ) staying intact . I even used glue , but to this day it always pops out . It is very frustrating for my 3 year old because she is n't even rough with this crib and yet her babies are always falling right through ! The doors stopped working within a month ; the pieces came apart one by one until I just took the catch off and let them swing freely . And forget about the crib mobile , that was the first thing to get tossed . If only this were more durable , it would have been just perfect . It is an adorable little crib and just the right size with cute tie-on bedding that fits perfectly next to her toddler bed , but alas I will be picking her up a hard plastic crib to replace this for X-mas . I 'm sure she 'll be much happier and her babies will stop bumping their heads . I recommend you buy something more durable to start , too ! I also picked mine up for about $ [ ... ] through another site , so if you are insisted on buying this product I suggest shopping around if its still overpriced here !	-1
The tray ripped off . And it came without the washers it 's supposed to have to let the arms raise and lift freely . Such potential , but it turned out to be junk .	-1
This was a big let down . Ours was wobbling within a week and completely broke in a month . I do n't know what the material it is made out of , but it almost seemed like compressed chipboard with paint . For a simple gift , buy it ... For an heirloom , steer clear .	-1
Cute but poorly made . The tray broke within a few weeks of proper use . No strap to hold the doll in place . Once the tray broke it 's pretty much unusable . The style is cute I just wish the tray was better designed . If it was a better design this would be a 5 star easily .	-1
Bratz haters , we are being challenged by dumb*** , retarded bratz slaves . We will show those bratz-obessed idiots who REALLY ARE the great dolls : My scene . They really rock ! ! ! ! And who would want a snobby doll with a swollen head , teeny tiny anorexic bodies , and evil Satanic style ? ? ? FIGHT , FELLOW HATERS	-1
I bought this toy thinking it would be good to use on my doorway jumperoo . The jumperoo has two rings on the two front suspension straps to hang toys on . But when I got the Whoozit Activity Spiral , it turns out it is very tightly coiled , like a spring ; not flexible or bendable . It is difficult to uncoil it or to stretch it out . And there is no mechanism to attach it to things . Although it seems to advertise that you can wrap it around anything , this is completely not true . There is no wire or anything inside it to attach it with . If you feed it through a hole , it might stay . But in the case of my jumperoo , it would n't stay hooked on , but just coiled back up and fell off . So then I tried it on the baby 's carseat . Again , it wouldnt ' stay on . It was too short to wrap a coil from each end around the bars of the car seat , so it would just slide up to the top of the bar as it contracted , or it would fall right off . IF it were made of something stretchier , or if it had wire inside that would allow you to wrap the ends around something , it might be good . I think the baby would like the little dangling toys on it . But as it is , it wo n't attach to anything we have . And when it is so tightly coiled ( as it is all the time unless you 're stretching it out yourself ) the toys are all jumbled up in the coils and not visible or reachable for baby . So to me it is a pretty useless toy .	-1
I used to have this wrapped around the arch of our Gymini by Tiny Love . However , I removed it once baby started using her hands in opposition to each other , because she could pull it off , and as such it presents a strangulation hazard . I still let her use it , but only under supervision . I have it wrapped around one of the straps on my Ergo baby carrier .	-1
This puzzle looks and feels sturdy . However , it will sound unexpectedly even when the puzzle is not in place . Sometimes it will give you a creepy feel because of it . Mine will sound especially when I turn my lights off ( even without all the puzzle pieces in place ! ) . Sometimes it will sound when I walk by it . On the other hand , it wo n't sound even after I put the puzzle together 5 out of 10 times . I wo n't recommend it .	-1
We keep our puzzles in a basket and every time someone walks the sound goes off . Not a big deal during the day ... . but during nap time or in the middle of the night ( when even one of our cats walks by ) I cringe fearing `` ribbet , ribbet '' is going to wake up our toddler . And as I mentioned in the title , this puzzle is LOUD so you can hear it throughout the house ! Also , the kitten piece does n't sound like a meow at all and the parakeets `` squawk '' sounds closer to fingernails running down a chalkboard.I 'd be over it if this was one of his favorites . But our son does n't favor this particular puzzle over any other . The wood puzzle itself is of the same quality you 'd expect in a M & D ; product , so that is the only reason it gets two stars.Bottom line : Save a couple of bucks and buy the M & D ; puzzles that do n't make noise .	-1
This puzzle is constantly making noises on it 's own . I thought it was possessed or we had spirits communicating through the puzzle.I read the reviews after I bought the puzzle and it turns out this is happening to other people who have the puzzle . It also makes animals noises when you place the wrong piece over it so that teaches nothing . Sometimes it wo n't make the noises at all even if you touch the metal piece inside the picture .	-1
We bought a Fur Real Polar Cub at Wal-Mart today . It was so cute ! I took it out of its box this evening to install batteries and put in Santa 's secret box ... of course I could not resist a little trial play.My first disappointment was how hard and unsnuggly he was , like holding a clanky metal box wrapped in not-soft fur . His arms were long and stiff , sticking straight out . But he was still cute ... I installed the batteries and he started making lots of sounds and moving by himself as I read his booklet of instructions . His movements caused a buzzing mechanical sound . His voice/sounds did not sound like a bear ... He sounded very much like a geo-pet , or whatever those things are called that sigh and coo and laugh unnaturally . This polar cub could do many tricks , as I read through the instructions , but it was like work to make him perform - a total imagination killer . But still ... he did look pretty cute sitting there movng by himself ... I reluctantly decided he is not the right kind of toy for us . I apologized to him as I wired him back into his box , and hoped someone else will buy him and love him . =o ) He is very cute , and he sucks his bottle , but he is too clunky and noisy and demanding for free play .	-1
This magic kit has its plusses and minuses . Overall more minuses than pluses in my mind especially for a Mellissa and Doug toy . Generally Mellissa and Doug make great toys , but I 'm very disappointed in this case.The kit contains 10 magic tricks that I suggest a child at least 7 to 8 years old can present to an audience of kids from about 4 to no older than 8 or 9.The plusses:1 . Seven of ten magic tricks are good to acceptable for younger kids.2 . In general , the instructions are easy to follow.The minuses:1 . The quality is very poor ; extremely in some cases : a . The kit has a disappearing scarf trick that uses a magic bag . The bag is made exceptionally poor- seems and glued areas are coming apart after the 1st use and a hinged portion makes a lot of noise all that completely ruins the trick that a 4 year old noticed.b . The kit also has some wooden cards with numbers on it for a number guessing trick . The trick is great , but the numbers on the cards very easily scrap off to the point after about five times doing the trick some numbers are almost missing . The numbers were already partially faded ( scraped off ) out of the box.2 . One trick ( disappearing box ) is very confusing at best were even several adults could not figure it out how to make the trick even sort of look like magic ( the whole point of the toy ) .3 . Another trick ( vanishing zone ) is where you slide a wand through a wooden box and the middle of the wand disappears . It 's very obvious how it 's done even for a 5 year old and the wooden box is another poorly constructed item adding to the usefulness of the trick .	-1
I ordered this for my 8 year old grandson . When I opened the box and saw all the Chinese and Egyptian art on the pieces , I have to say I was a bit turned off by it . I decided not to give it to him after all . I am sure this would not bother most people , but it appeared mystical to me and just does n't fit in with our conservative Christian views .	-1
Purchased this set for son for birthday . It looked cute online , it shipped quickly , and looked cute in person . Then we opened it and the real problem surfaced : very poor construction . It is a very cute idea but poorly designed . One piece broke immediately , which is frustrating . It has now been two days since it was opened and another piece has broken too . He is not rough with his toys at all , just trying to do & # 34 ; magic shows & # 34 ; and the parts do n't hold up . There are other magic kits online , buy one of those instead this one is just pure crap . Do n't waste your money .	-1
These snap bracelets are not worth the money . Each bracelet is a piece of metal covered by a sleeve of flimsy animal print fabric with a seam going all up the bracelet and then sewn shut on each end . One of the ends was n't sewn very well ( on all 12 of the bracelets ) , and had quite a bit of fraying fabric sticking out . There were also small stickers on each bracelet ( I think they said Made in China or something like that ) that had very strong adhesive . When I went to remove these stickers ( after all , Santa 's elves do n't work in China last I heard ) the fabric actually ripped on a couple of them and I had to throw them away . It took me about half an hour to remove 12 stickers , if that gives you an idea of what a pain it was . I would definitely not recommend these bracelets -- Santa and his elves really goofed this time .	-1
My parents bought this toy for my 5 1/2 year old for Christmas . My first reaction was WHY ? IT HAS SLIME ! ! Yikes . You ca n't let the slime touch clothing , furniture , rugs etc . Hmmm ... And how do we play with it then ? If I had my way it would have been returned to the store immediately . We all wish it had been , so he could be enjoying a replacement toy now . Anyway , my dad put it together at his house for him right away - it took about 90 minutes . Then the car that came with it would n't work - did n't get all the way up the ramp . They finally gave up on it and found other htings to do . We took it home and I attempted to put it back together ( many parts fell off on the move to our house ) and it took me nearly another hour . I could n't get it to work either . Pieces were constantly falling off ( some are actually MEANT to fall of every time the car goes by ! Ugh ! ) the car did n't make it through ANY of the `` obstacles '' . And I certainly was n't about to open the tub of slime . The only way my son played with it was to take the pieces that had fallen off and bang on the volcano with them trying to make it `` open '' .He received another HW set as a gift for Christmas and that one went RIGHT back to the store . I will never buy another HOt Wheels playset . This one is currently in pieces in a box in the closet til I find someone to pawn it off on.On a positive note ( though not positive for this toy ) I exchanged his other HW set for a Matchbox set that has been a HUGE hit at our house . Matchbox sets work , Hot Wheels do n't .	-1
My son loves this toy and we have had little to no trouble with it except for the fact that you can not purchase more slime in the stores . The slime does not last and yes we clean it up after each use , never leave it our and even ziplock it but it still disappears before our eyes ! Anyways if it was easy to purchase more then I would give this toy 4 stars because my 5 year old loves it .	-1
On the upside the harmonica is excellent quality , my 2 year old loves playing it for his baby sisters . The shake things with the metal in them are nice , we walk around the house shaking them , dancing . The crate is really nice , we keep our melissa/doug pound and roll in it so the balls do n't go all over the house.On the downside is my son does n't really like the triangle , he ca n't figure out the ( yellow/red ) hand the clappity things , the long clapper ( red/blue/green ) does n't impress him , the kazoo we thought was a whistle gets little use , the end of the flute came off and is no where to be found , we 're not sure what the hallow piece of wood instrument is for . They xylophone is really monotone , it all sounds the same , one of the wooden knobs that holds the one of the red pieces on fell off so not that piece slides around.In conclusion , the set is cute , all solid wood , but gets little use . I 'd recommend getting a metal xylophone instead . We bought a nice one on novanatural made of metal and wood for $ 20 . Find a different kazoo , we have a metal one he loves , it was kind of nice having 2 of them because his friends could play too . Invest in a harmonica , this one or another .	-1
I had several issues with this toy and wish I had n't bought it . They are as follows , and these are the same problems many other people have had.First of all , this toy was horribly made . The jingle sticks in particular were rough on the handles . Were these sanded down at all ? I seriously doubt they were . I seriously feared splinters from them . I mean , wood chips were all over in the box when we opened it.I know this is a toy , but the point should still be to foster a love of music in kids that play with it . That will not happen with these instruments . It is impossible to make any kind of real music with these . The xylophone is made of wood which is so soft that my child dented it the first day , and all the `` notes '' it plays sound the same . The notes on the recorder are the same way . They are just screeches with no distinction between the notes . The rest of the instruments are just random wooden things meant for banging , so you really ca n't mess them up.There are some good toy instruments out there , but I really would n't want someone to think they had found them with this toy . This is definitely not worth even half as much as this costs .	-1
FIrst off , I was excited about this toy . I am a music teacher and could n't wait to play with this.I 'll keep this short.1 . The xylophone was out of tune . There was no correct mallet to play it.2 . The kazoo is poor quality and does n't resonate well . Baby does like to carry it around.3 . The recorder fell apart when I tried to clean it . Also NOT in tune.4 . Castanets were nice but strings were too small to allow them to be played correctly.5 . Jingle sticks were ok but require a lot of force to get them to play . 12 month old boy was unable to do it unassisted.Overall , this set is lacking and disappointing for me . If you are not bothered by what I mentioned above , then buy this toy . You will most likely enjoy it . As a professional I would not purchase it again , nor would I give it as a gift to anyone . In short , Its CHEAPLY MADE AND EXECUTED . Also , it comes in a sharp wooden box that must be disposed of immediately .	-1
i 'm only glad i got it on sale at amazon for 35 $ otherwise i would not be happy . its just small , looks like a toy , not kids piano . so unfortunately she doesnt pay that much attention too it as i wish and prefers a real size piano . dont waste your money on this one unless a good sale is going on.in fact what i 've learned is all & # 34 ; melissa and doug & # 34 ; toys are small . i mean small for even 1 year old baby . the blocks ? have you seen those ? puzzles seem to be the only toy they make wright.check out the piano at walmart.com . look a lot more like real , its high ( your child can actually sit on the chair and play ) and i dont remember but the cost is about the same ( or even less ) !	-1
The piano is very cute but it fell apart as my daughter was taking it out of the box to give to my grandson .	-1
I gave this to my 4 year old grandson on his birthday . All the kids were playing with it . After a while the keys started sticking down . They would come up slowly . The color note chart got torn off by his 1 year old brother the same day . The size was very small . I thought it would be bigger . I would recommend this for 18 mos to 3 years . I expected more of Melissa & Doug toys . So , I 'm disappointed in this . I had a toy piano when I was small . It was a no brand one . But , I still remember the sound and it was taller . I was hoping to recreate the feel of the one I loved so much .	-1
I am sending this back it was broken and cracked in the wood upon arrival and the sound of the keys was terrible didnt sound like a piano should at all . It was also quiet a bit smaller than I had hoped especially for a toddler for the age range its stated for . Dissappointed .	-1
I bought this because i thought it would be great for my 18month old . Once i received it i started to play a song using the book it came with . Right away i noticed some of the keys would get stuck down which made it hard to properly play a song . Also if you tap on a key over and over it will not recognize that and make a sound such as other pianos would do . For this price i think it can be constructed way better . I returned it.It is very pretty though .	-1
THis is poorly made . It should be better given the price . It fell apart not long after we got it ... really fell apart . Pieces of wood came loose and my child was able to get hold of the tiny screws that were used to make this . there are better toy pianos on the market .	-1
Sound quality is n't great . The colored scale just above the key 's is just a piece of paper glued on at both ends . That came off pretty quick . We 've had it for a year and one of the keys is already dead . My son ( now 2 ) likes it okay , he will go over and bang on it for a few minutes now and then but overall it takes up space . Only reason it 's still around is Nana got it for him .	-1
We ended up returning this . Like others said , there was a smell to it when we opened it . I think that would have gone away eventually . But the reason we returned the item was because the top key did n't work immediately . I had to jiggle it to get it to work . I felt like if my son tried playing with the other keys , they could all decide to stop working . The sound is a very much a & # 34 ; tink tink & # 34 ; sound and nothing like a piano . I expected that and was not surprised.What bothered me more was that it was slightly off-key . If it had been on-key , the & # 34 ; tink tink & # 34 ; quality to the sound would n't have been bad . Since we got this at 50 % off , we debated returning it . It might be worth it to keep if you paid about $ 30 . I would not buy it at full price .	-1
I 've owned this toy for 2 years . I bought it when my twin girls were 1 and they are now 3 . This toy is practical for an infant to bang on the keys to make noise . It is not practical for a toddler `` learning '' how to play the piano because it is A ) off-key and B ) too small . In my opinion there are many , many other less expensive noise-making toys for infants to bang on . Not quite worth fifty dollars .	-1
I do n't know if this happened from using the hook to hang dry elmo , but now his neck is ripped half way around and stuffing falling out . We have been using this toy for about 5 months , since my daughter got it as a christmas gift . She really enjoyed the crayons and even coloring elmo . The crayons are still holding up and have n't worn down as fast as the other reviewers said . She did draw on our bathroom wall , though , which was a not too pleasant side effect of the tub crayons . We have a plastic tub and the crayons were not a problem as far as staining goes.Overall it was nice while it lasted !	-1
Kind of flimsy . Not full decks IMO . I think there are better games/value out there . It was okay . I just think there are better quality out there . But for four games at a cheap price , I guess it 's fine .	-1
My family is not stupid , but reading the instructions , this thing just does n't work . I have to say that our & # 34 ; amaze & # 34 ; has a yellow background instead of the white in the picture . Maybe they have changed it.This is a worthless product if they have n't .	-1
I was disappointed in this game . I purchased it as a Christmas gift and it just is n't what I thought it would be .	-1
Not really what I thought it would be . You just slide levers back and forth . You are n't suppose to lift your stylus up , which is n't reliable . Making it to the end of the maze is challenging , but this maze is just too repetitive and too easy to cheat on and too easy to accidently lift your stylus and then have to start over .	-1
My nephew , who love mazes , played with this for maybe 20 minutes and then put it down and never went back . It 's kind of flimsy and the moving parts do n't move all that smoothly . And I guess , though he loves puzzles , he just did n't find this all that much fun .	-1
I do n't like it and I do n't want to recommend it to anyone . it 's too cheap kind of toy for kids	-1
Hard to pose in a realistic manner . Not really cuddly . Looks like it does in the picture , but has hard wires running through it to keep it standing .	-1
Very disappointed in this toy . I have purchased a lot of Melissa & Doug toys for my grandkids over the years and this just did not measure up . The house itself is made of some type of board and pictures are pasted on to depict the house , and they have already started to curl up at the edges . The keys are attached at the top on the handle with a black strap that is barely long enough to allow the key to be inserted in the door . The locks and keys are just so cheaply made , it is difficult to even get the key in . The little people are hideous . Would have been better to just leave them out than put in such cheaply made ones . At first my 2 and 3 year old grandkids tried to play with this and then became very frustrated because the keys just do n't work well , the inside is partitioned into four small areas that nothing can really go in , and the door bells make a pitiful noise that is barely able to be heard . This toy is in my garage for the next garage sale , though I hate to even sell it to anyone.Very disappointed and would definitely not recommend .	-1
Purchased this for my autistic sons therapy . Wrong colors on sequencing boards . Bead colors did not match Colors on boards or the design of the beads . Never been disappointed in Melissa and Doug products but this purchase I am . Sorry . Sending it back .	-1
This was very cheap . Just because it lights up does n't make it quality . Its cute , but bet you could find it cheaper at a dollar store or the equivalent . Definitely do n't recommend . There is probably something better quality out there . The watch face is a sticker . Even Chick Fil A gives out working watches with a kids meal . Come on people !	-1
Returned this product as one of the pieces came broken . It is very cute and a great idea , but so cheaply made that we did n't bother getting it replaced for fear that it would just break too easily with a toddler .	-1
Just like everyone else the volume is way to low . My daughter wo n't even play with in more than 2 minutes if that . They need to do better ! : )	-1
Baby could take it or leave it when she got it at 6 months . She 's 10 months now and is bored with it . Kind of a frenetic little toy that does n't do much beyond lighting up and flashing . Push buttons , get noise . A voice says `` 1-2-3 . '' It is n't close enough to a real cell or house phone to encourage phone play ; beyond the robot voice saying counting or saying abc 's in threes , depending on which # you press , it 's not much of an educational toy either . And the songs in the music mode are too short ! Just a bar or two of melody . I 'd skip this one .	-1
My mil has this phone at her house for the kids to play with . it 's an ok phone for the kids to pretend with . they do n't even really play with it the way it 's supposed to be played with . you can hardly hear the voice in it . and it sounds all distorted ... .they all did in the store . it 's some times hard to make out the letter , too . it 's not a very clear toy . great toy to play with , maybe not for the educational part ... or even to listen to since you ca n't hear it . i 'd get something different for educational and listening skills .	-1
Since this is a telephone toy , most babies will eventually put it to their ear to imitate adults . If this toy is put near MY ear and I press a button , it hurts my ear ! There is no volume control , and while it is not that bad when you play with it in your hands , when it is by your ear , it is dangerously loud . I love Fisher Price -- love the learning home , birdbath and puppy , but not this one .	-1
If my 2 year old would ever play with this toy I 'm sure it would be educational for him . It plays a bit of music and says letters and numbers out loud as your child hits the buttons . The reason I did n't give it 5 stars for educational value was because it says all the numbers out loud except for `` zero . '' When you hit `` zero '' it says , `` bye bye . `` My 2 year old who loves to play with the regular telephone was n't interested in this toy at all . There 's nothing `` fun '' about it for a very small child .	-1
Our daughter got this phone in her Easter basket . She LOVES the phone ... corded , cell , cordless ... any phone . We thought this would a good alternative to her playing with the deal . Well we were wrong ! The thing is SO soft you ca n't even hear it most times ! Then it does n't sing the whole alphabet and it does n't do all the numbers . But the biggest thing was she knew it was a fake and really wanted nothing to do with it . I think that was mainly becasue she could n't hear it.We ended up leaving this in our hotel room in Orlando when we were there on vacation a few weeks back and when the hotel called us about returning it to us , we told them clean it and add it to the toy bin in the daycare center . It was n't worht the shipping charges to get it back to us ! We did find her a phone a few weeks ago . Its by Parents ( the magazine people ) . It looks just like a real cell phone and it talks , beeps and plays music . Plus you can record a message for her to hear . She loves to hear her daddy during the day when he 's at work and he loves comign up with new mesages to leave her each morning .	-1
my daughter received this as a gift on her first birthday . she already had a sesame street phone , so this one did n't make much of an impression on her . i tried to entice her with it , but it 's so quiet ... she could n't really hear it . nor could i. it does n't really matter if the alphabet flashes across the front of it if you ca n't hear it .	-1
I think this is much too loud for a child who may put it up to his/her ear as a phone ( which my son loves to do ) . I found this out the hard way on myself . I do not allow him to play with on now , if at all . Otherwise , I have no problem with it .	-1
This toy is a wonderfully educational and fun toy but it is so loud ! There is no volume control and when I held it up to my own ear when I was playing with my daughter I was shocked and terrified by how loud this was . If it made my ear ring what was it doing to hers ? The only way to remedy the problem of the noise was to remove the batteries which takes away from the appeal . I give it fives stars for it 's fun , educational , and durable qualities but really want to caution parents about the decibel level that , with prolonged use , could do some permanent damage to a small child 's hearing . I was suprised Fisher Price was not more aware of the problem and did not attempt to make it more safe and user friendly . I typically only buy Fisher Price toys because of the quality but would urge them to consider volume controls or limits on their toys . I know as a parent I should be more cognizant of the dangers of toys I purchase for my children but in my haste to find a teaching toy I overlooked the aspect of safety . I figured a one piece toy with no obvious design flaws , small parts , choking hazards , etc . would be perfect . This is how I learn as a parent and I hope my experience helps others out there who want their children to be healthy !	-1
We bought two video now Colors , and a video Now Jr. for our kids , thinking it would be fun for the car . However with standard alkaline batteries not one of them lasts for more than 5 minutes . I spent money on the more expensive ( M3 ) batteries , and they seem to last longer . However at $ 9 a pack that seems a bit pricey , even the rechargables do n't hold up well in the player .	-1
My daughter was very excited to receive this - VERY excited - it was going to be for use in the car - long commutes - it SOMETIMES works OK , other times it skips , says no disk etc . I even gave her a pillow to put on her lap to stop the bumps , also the resolution on the screen is VERY POOR . for a 70 dollar item , the resolution should be better , the picture quality should be better and this should not skip as often as it does . Instead of this item , I suggest a portable DVD player	-1
I have to agree with others on this one . The microphone broke off leaving 2 sharp peices of plastic ! We returned this ! Thank goodness the garbage truck hadnt come yet to pick up the box ! Do n't buy this !	-1
Any mattress we used was so hard my grandson could n't sleep in the bed beyond a few weeks . We gave it to him for Christmas and by the end of Janaury it was in the attic . An absolute waste of money !	-1
We bought this for our son last Christmas and it was broken within 3 weeks ! ! ! This is unacceptable for any toy , much less one I paid $ 20 for ! ! The page in the middle that switches modes just stopped working for no reason whatsoever . My son has NEVER broken a toy and we own many Fisher Price and LeapFrog toys . I tried to exchange it many many times and the store never got it back in stock . I tried to contact Vtech via email and had my email returned as undeliverable . It was a cute idea , especially how the song `` voice '' changes when you touch a different animal , but with the safety issue with the pig and how hard it is for little ones to move the sheep , it 's just not worth it . We bought another Vtech toy last Christmas as well ( Sing & Discover Piano ) and it broke within 2 months . I will never buy another Vtech toy ! ! There are much better toys out there . Do n't waste your money ! !	-1
I just received a response from the company that to me is subpar given that these toys are in the mouths and hands of babies and children and contain BPA and PVC . I 've read the research on both materials and conclude that I do n't want my child to be exposed to either , especially on a daily basis . As these items are made in China and not rigorously tested , I am afraid to know what goes under the radar . I also feel this glut of cheap , plastic material is not good for the earth .	-1
My son got this move & crawl ball last Christmas - he was 5 months old at the time . He is now almost 17 months , and this toy has been taken away from him ! He began crawling at 8 months old , and it did not help him crawl at all . The only thing that would make him crawl forward was the remote ! lol . The ball does move well on the carpet and on the hardwood floors , but it was just not for my son . The interest in it was just not there . Once and a while I would find him pushing the buttons to hear the music , but that was it . It recently got taken away because he would pick it up and throw it ( like he does with his other balls he has ) but this one is extremely heavy and the ball is hard plastic . He thinks it is one of the balls that are ok to throw in the basketball hoop , and almost breaks things , so I took it away . It is a sturdy toy consitering it 's been thrown around alot , and the colors are very vibrant with the flashing lights . Just becasue my son does n't show interest in the ball does n't mean your child wont like it , but it is just not rated high in my book . Just be ware that that the ball is heavy , and can be dropped on their little toes and injure them once they can grasp on .	-1
I ca n't stand this toy . My daughter is eleven months old , and she plays with it a little bit.Pros:1 . My daughter finds it mildly amusing.2 . It shuts off on its own in order to preserve battery-life.Cons:1 . The voice of this toy is so incredibly annoying . I feel myself gritting my teeth when my daughter plays with it . I hate to say this , but it sounds like a child-molesting clown , especially when it says , `` Rollllll me ! '' My husband agrees with me , and my sister said it sounds like a pedophile dinosaur when she was here.2 . This ball rolls in circles on its own , but I do n't consider that a good thing , because it seems to just confuse my daughter instead of making her chase after it , because it rolls erratically in small circles.3 . It tells you to select things , but it rolls before you get a chance.4 . There is no way to turn off the sound without turning off the entire toy.5 . The features on it do not hold my daughter 's attention for very long . She is eleven months old , but she 's had this for a few months , and she 's never been interested in it very much.6 . It says the same few things over and over again , and when my daughter stops playing with it , it wo n't shut its infernal yacking for what seems like forever until it finally turns itself off , and even then , it had gone on for so long that I hear its pedo-echos in my mind for eternity . `` Rolllll me '' haunts me even in my sleep.I would seriously get pleasure out of throwing this toy against the wall until it 's in one hundred pieces . I want to kick it over and over again just to make the pedo-clown voice shut up .	-1
This toy makes lots of noise even without the baby touching it . Also a lot of lights . My son was interested in it for a few minutes . He crawled after it and then it bonked him in the head . He did n't care that much but besides the toy being a bit loud and annoying ... it 's hurtful .	-1
Bought this a gift because I heard it was great . My 9 month old grandson was n't too interested in it . I think it need to more lights to attract his attention .	-1
I 'm surprised , but this toy was a bust with my son . We got it for him when he was 9 mo old . He 'd rather play with other balls that are n't making noise . I 'll try it again soon , but so far , not so good .	-1
This is the most annoying toy my daughter owns . There are six buttons for children to press . Three that alternate between making animal noises /naming the corresponding animal and playing a song made up of electronic barking etc . The other 3 buttons count 1-3 and name shapes . These features would be tolerable if you were n't constantly bombarded with several phrases : `` flashing lights and music too it 's fun playing games with you '' `` roll roll roll the ball gently as can be watch it spin round and round it 's fun to play you 'll see '' `` so much here to learn and see why do n't you come and play with me . '' These play when you turn on the toy and when it thinks you have n't touched the toy recently enough and before it shuts off . It is the most obnoxious toy . By daughter will occasionally play with it , otherwise I 'd throw it away . Not recommended .	-1
I purchased this ball when my daughter was four months old because it says that it promotes crawling . She looks at the ball , but does n't have much interest in it at all . It rolls/wobbles in a circle and plays annoying sing-songy phrases . You ca n't decipher what it is saying when you press the number/animal buttons . As other reviewers have pointed out there is no promotion of cause and effect if the stimulus does not result in anything immediate . The only educational value ( cause and effect ) is that if she pushes it it makes noise and rolls around . However , it also does this on its own when some time has elapsed .	-1
There is allot going on with this toy . Loud noises , movement , different lights and textures . Almost TO much . My daughter bats it around sometimes for a few minuets then gets fussy and leaves it . I tried giving it to my girlfriend and her baby had the same reaction . Wish I did n't purchase it . We have had it for a few months and she still does n't like it .	-1
I am not sure why this crawl ball has so many positive reviews here on Amazon . We own it and my daughter has little interest in it . The ball moves in a circle . Not the way a real ball moves . It 's just a loud annoying toy that does not hold my 11 month old 's interest.This is an update to my original review above . My daughter is past the crawling stage and has finally taken an interest in this ball . ( she is 14 months old now ) She mostly enjoys the music . She pushes the buttons and dances to the different songs . Please note my daughter is walking now and this ball did nothing to encourage her to crawl or walk . Also now that she is walking she picks this ball up and tries to throw it because she thinks it is a ball . It 's pretty heavy and if it were to fall on her foot she could really hurt herself . She needs to be supervised while using this toy . It 's kind of dangerous because it gives young children the impression that it is a ball that should be thrown .	-1
I bought this for the same reason as a lot of the reviewers did- learning to crawl . Not so much . I bought this when my daughter was 6 months , she had no interest in this ball . When she did learn to crawl- this still did n't catch her eye . It does not roll on carpet very well so it just wears the motor out . My daughter does play with this a little now at 10 months but she gets bored after 3 mins of it . I wish I spent my money on something else .	-1
I got this toy when my daughter was 6 months and since then she could n't be less interested , she is currently 11 months and has n't played with it once , i wish I would n't have wasted my money1 . It 's too heavy to pic up2 . It 's spontanious , it moves around and will hit the baby , which scares her3 . How is a 6 month old supposed to find the letter/number/ animal in time , it only gives you 30seconds maybeIt 's just not what I expected	-1
Within about a month of owning this toy the toy started having problems . I thought it was just a low battery but after I put new batteries in it still had issues . After having similar problems with other Vtech toys I will NEVER be buying a Vtech toy ever again .	-1
This toy needs work ... First of all , it 's HEAVY ! My daughter ( now 19 months ) usually likes to pick it up and throw it . After all , it IS a ball ! We have hardwood floors - throwing this ball is extremely loud and it can really do some damage to our floors ! We do n't have any problems with it moving around ... however ... when you 're asked to find something on the ball , even I have a hard time finding it to push the button in time . So , I do n't know how a 6 month+ baby/child could find the correct answer in time.I think this is a nice idea for a toy , but it just does n't work . It is colorful , and my daughter does enjoy throwing it , but that 's obviously not it 's intended use . She never played with this toy as a crawling infant . She only plays with it now , and she only throws it . Please do n't waste your money on this toy . It 's not worth it !	-1
My girls both had no interest in this one . The adults in the house played more with this ( trying to get them to play ) than the actual children .	-1
the concept of a self-rolling ball that asks to be played with is awesome ( especially if it could follow you ) , but this one just wiggles a little bit . the voice should be less repetitive and annoying too . you can find this very discounted at walmart , etc ( $ 5 ) .	-1
We got this to help our son learn to crawl . It makes sense to learn to crawl on something soft , like carpet , but this ball does n't roll or move well on carpet . In addition it was very annoying . In general , our son did not enjoy it much at all . I would not recommend it .	-1
At first glance it seemed to be the perfect gift for a baby with a thing for all things wheels and musical . AND normally I really trust the Vtech name - so I did n't look at the item too closely prior to buying it . But it did n't take long for me to realize what a mistake I made . Yes , he likes it very much and uses it well , and it performs well etc . However , I will agree that there is NOTHING nice about how the voices speak or what they say - and I would never think that I would have such a 'prudish ' view on a baby toy ! But it is rude , it is obnoxious and I do n't like the message - if you can say that there is one - I mean - they could have had much more endearing snippets . There is little education in it really - and the songs are short the lyrics to the ABC song is half cut out ? ! ? ! ? I could do without having education in a toy - but that coupled with the bad attitude - I have one thing to say `` Outta ' my house '' The older version of this toy is MUCH better with friendlier voices and helpful 'neighbors ' . Vtech should go back to the old version .	-1
I usually like V-Tech , but this one missed the mark ! My 1 year old liked it -- for about 10 minutes . he 'd play with it sporadically over the next few weeks , but I found myself hoping he would n't . The voice is a demanding little kid , screaming , `` Outta the Way ! '' and `` Fill 'er up ! '' I relegated the thing to the car , hoping maybe he 'd like to turn the steering wheel when I drive , but the `` on '' switch is hyper-sensitive , and every time we 'd go over a bump in the road , the ! @ # $ thing would turn on ! And the worst part is , it does n't have an auto-shut off feature . It just keeps making noise ! Oh , and the volume is LOUD , too ! Save your money !	-1
This gift was given to my son as a gift . He does n't yet play with it , but my 19 month old daughter does . It is loud and obnoxious . It says rude things . It is , in my opinion , sexist . It turn on too easily . It was in the floor and my dog kept making the thing talk when he would brush against it . If it were not a gift , I would have taken it back . Do n't waste your money . It does n't teach anything but bad manners .	-1
My 1 year old was given this for his birthday . Some of the phrases are rude . The songs are sung off key . The rollers do n't always play the special song when there are 3 of a kind lined up . The car sounds are enough to make me batty . I do n't see where it is teaching the child anything since it might say any one of three things for each picture . Is it the number ? Is it the shape ? Maybe this time it 's going to be the animal . The low volume setting is still too loud . The only reason I 've given it 2 stars instead of 1 is because my son likes this toy despite the fact that the loses interest after a few minutes..	-1
Within just a week of owning this toy it started having problems . The sounds stopped working ( the lights would work ) and then the problems quickly escalated . I believe that when the on switch is turned to the on position it is not making a complete connection . I called customer service and was disappointed that they could n't do anything except tell me to replace the batteries ( which I had ) . I lost the registration card so unfortunately this toy is just going in the trash . After several bad experiences with low quality vtech toys I will NEVER buy a Vtech toy ever again .	-1
This toy has limited interest for my son . I bought it for him when he was 18 mos ( he is now 2 ) . He occasionally plays with it for maybe 5 minutes at a time . If you put it on a smooth surface ( table , hardwood floor ) it slides around when he tried to turn the wheel or pushes/pulls the gearshift . Also it is very LOUD and I find the tone of voice kind of rude : On the horn : `` out of the way '' , on the gas button `` fill er up '' - but the tone of voice is n't nice it sounds like a rude little kid demanding that he be listened to ... .NOW . Except for the police button which says `` slow down little fellow '' the rest of them sound like spoiled brats ! Not recommended .	-1
I bought this Helmet not too long ago , and it was great looking in it 's box . It took a while to get it out , and had to adjust it to my head to try it out . The pre-recorded voice came out nicely . It is the voice changer that I had trouble with . The voice changer has three level button on it , and I tried all of'em . None realy worked . I mean it , not a single one of them even came close . At times as I have read in other reviews I had to shout just to hear the outcome , which you could probably tell that it would have sounded bad . I tried to wisper my breathing and I got close to the original breathing voice of Vader . I am a big fan of Star Wars , but this is pretty disappointing .	-1
Eh , just ok . Mask does n't fit great . Voice changer has a delay and sounds like garbage . The two halves does n't got together well and make it very difficult to wear .	-1
I wo n't add much to the very complete reviews on here . I will only add that my children were given this by Santa per their request . They are ages 4 & 5 . They are very big for their age . They love all things Star Wars . They were very excited to see it initially . They wore it 1x , for 2 minutes , took it off & refuse to put it back on . I was lucky to snap a picture quickly because they wo n't even put it on for pictures.The complaints I have heard '' It 's too heavy '' '' It 's too hot '' '' I ca n't see '' I also bought the Captain Rex= same complaints.Bottom line . While I guess an occasional child would enjoy this mask I do n't understand why . It is VERY big ( too big & heavy for me as a small female ) You ca n't see through the lenses . It 's very hot even with the small front vent . I was able to remove the dark eye shields easily with a screw driver , but it still makes my kids ball up in sweat in 2 minutes.I wish I had n't spent $ on these.It 's a great mask for adults . Very sturdy . Looks great . Just not for children .	-1
This game was very boring . I tried playing it with my family and with some friends , all adults over 25 , and nobody found it intriguing . I do n't understand what is so great about deciding if you would rather stand in an elevator filled with fat men with bad breath or an elevator filled with wet dogs . The questions were neither interesting nor funny . Everyone agreed it they would rather play a different game .	-1
I do n't know if my family is just weird or what , but we did n't even finish playing the first ( and only ) game . They took it to be a strategy game , so they were guessing what the other person would say to fake them out rather than guess what the other person would feel in his heart . But the scenarios were weird and contrived so it was n't like learning something new about each other . Those types of scenarios would never come up . I really wanted to love it . I hyped it up before we started , but ended up with a big let down .	-1
This marble run , and similar varieties by Quercetti sold by Amazon , Target , and other stores , is terrible . The plastic pieces do not stay together . An ADULT will spend almost all of their time constantly re-assembling falling down sections they attempt to put together . Assembly for a child of 4+ ( age recommendation by the manufacturer ) is impossible . I 've used marble runs from other manufacturers and have not experienced this level of poor design . However , I 've never seen a marble run that is made so that the pieces connect solid and certainly not one that can be assembled by the recommended age . I believe in general they are not worth the effort and time trying to get them together and to stay together . Do something else that 's much more interactive and satisfying with your child .	-1
We bought this for our children for Christmas . They love the toy when its put together but they complain constantly about how easy it falls apart . It falls apart at the slightest touch enough that they have already quit playing with it .	-1
Bought it at Target for $ 16 , money would 've been better spent on the needed toilet paper instead . Instruction shows 3 or 4 designs , I chose the one using 4 legs , after wasting 30+ minutes to put it together , at first , marble will keep rolling thru , when it gets to the roller coaster like tracks section . Once I moved the whole thing to a different location , it now always gets stuck at the mid section of the roller coaster tracks . The tracks sits slightly tilted , where the marble does not have enough force to roll thru it , even the pictures within the instructions for that track looks slightly tilted . I test it by lifting it to make it level , then the marble rolls thru it without problems . But , how do I keep it permanently leveled ? I used floss to tie it to pull it up slightly . Besides that really disappointing issue , it 's really not that fun after 10 minutes of play , it now it 's sits in the corner of the garage , waiting for the next garbage day. [ ... ] .	-1
We have had these since Christmas and can not get them to properly work . My son still loves them but we ca n't actually DO anything with them . They just make noise , whether or not they actually & # 34 ; connect & # 34 ; with the other one .	-1
It 's like aiming blind because there are no lasers coming out ... i guess for safety reasons that is ok. My 4 and 6 yo son thought it was broken because it just made weak sounds . My kids played with it for 5 minutes and then left it on their wrists like bracelets.I thought it would an awesome toy for my boys but turned out to be a waste of money .	-1
I thought this would be an entertaining toy for my daughter 's first birthday and maybe her older sister ( 2 1/2 yrs ) could enjoy it too . I was wrong . The toy simply doesnt do that much . Sure it has a `` piano '' option which lets you use three keys to make music ( WOW ) and the alphabet soup in the middle is cute but doesnt do much other than play the alphabet song . It seems like alot of things to do when you are looking at the table but overall my kids seemed to push every button once or twice for a total of about 20 min of playtime and never really looked at it again . Not alot of value and replay for a toy this expensive and of this size.It is HUGE as a table should be - but its also easy to tip over . The legs are not as sturdy as they seem . It looks sturdy but those looks are decieving ! No one has sustained any injuries thus far but the table has toppled over more than once , usually because they grab it as they run past or throw ponies in the bowl.Save your money , buy something not as sizeable and something that has more functions !	-1
I purchased this launcher for my 3 year old son June 17th . I gave it to him as a gift June 24th . Today is July 22 and it no longer works ! So disappointed ! Of course to get a full refund I had to return it 2 days ago ! They have a VERY strict return policy . I would suggest going to Toys R Us or through a company that will stand behind their products that they sell .	-1
Just not happening on this one for my kids . At the current price of $ 22 , I 'd say to pass on this . That 's way to expensive for a game like this .	-1
This is fun and it works pretty well . But it is almost all plastic . This is a cool product , but I paid way too much for this . I paid about $ 100 and when I got it , I was shocked at what I paid for a mostly plastic toy . That said , if you put a heavy weight in the bottom ( ceramic tiles ) , it works good . The rackets are junk plastic , but you can use tennis racket . If this product were $ 30 to $ 40 , I would give it 5 stars .	-1
I bought this for my son as a gift a while ago thinking he would actually be able to play with it in the sand or dirt . The only good thing I can say about this product is that it looks nice out of the box , but looks can be deceiving so don & # 8217 ; t & # 8217 ; be fooled by the pictures or appearance of this toy excavator.Everything is made of thin cheap plastic that breaks very easily . Within a day one of the tracks came off and broke . At first I was able to snap it back together , but after two days the plastic broke completely . Then the base of the tracks and the top of the excavator separated and could not be fixed . My son ended up just playing with the top part of the toy and then the bucket teeth broke and the plastic hydraulic bars broke off . IT LASTED LESS THAN A WEEK AND WENT INTO THE TRASH ! ! ! JUNK ! ! ! This & # 8220 ; toy & # 8221 ; is not meant to be played with by any child .	-1
First and foremost , the User Experience video that Bruder uses to promote this toy will set false expectations for the consumer . For example , Bruder USA shows this Excavator going down hill in the sand . Its actually a wooden ramp hidden by sand and a cleaver low camera angle . Bottom line , this is not a sand toy by any stretch of the imagination . In fact , at the Bruder USA website , they correctly position this as an `` indoor toy '' . So why they promote this way is beyond me.The Tractor Belts are difficult to turn and if they get sand in them , the hard plastic belts lockup and then slides when pushing it across the sand making for a poor user experience . It 's a shame Bruder did not use the rubber belts similar to the ones used on the Bruder Caterpillar Buldozer where the belts actually work in the sand . The engineer who designed this plastic belt , the product manager and video marketing manager should loose their jobs because this lame design and false expectation . The Excavator also comes with 20 or so individual little rubber inserts to aid the hard plastic tractor belts to stick to slick indoor surfaces . These inserts do not stay in the belts , get loose , get lost , and could become a hazard to smaller children ; more reason to switch the design to a rubber belt.The video also shows the product rotating with ease . This is somewhat misleading as well . It does swivel nicely when its not in the locked forward position and if the toy has never been exposed to sand . However , the forward position locks into a rut . To push it out takes three hands . Because the product is so light due to the plastic materials , the excavator would rather slide sideways in the sand than to swivel out of the rut and turn as it should . If any sand gets into this swivel area , it becomes real gritty , further impeding the ability to rotate the excavator.As for the Shovel , we used it once in dry , loose , white sand at our local park 's sand box . Because of the product 's poor design , the Shovel arm has practically no leverage nor sufficient weight behind it . So it is incapable of easily scooping up sand without putting your hand directly on the shovel . Again the Bruder Video demonstrating this capability used crafty video editing by only showing an already fully loaded shovel full of sand starting the video at the tale end of the scooping process . Again , deceptive marketing to misleading the consumer user experience with false expectations . This is critical when considering this is the primary function of the toy . Bruder does not show the product actually scooping up sand because the product is pretty much incapable of doing it with ease . The handle on the arm does a good job managing the scoop once dirt is in it , but its incapable of scooping up dirt as easily as the expectation they attempted to demonstrate . In a real user experience , one hand will be on the handle , another directly the other on the shovel to help it dig , and a third hand to help manage the excavator rotation if its locked in the forward position.The last negative is just a small gripe . The engine hood has a very small clip lock to keep it shut . Its too small and will not keep the hood closed.MY RECOMMENDATION TO THE CONSUMER is to buy the Bruder Liebherr Articulated Road Loader L574 . This has large wheels instead of a belt . It is the only Bruder Loader that turns and turns very well . The shovel leavers are designed and perform exceptionally well . Its size ratio matches the Bruder Dump Truck perfectly at 1:16 ratio . So the Articulated Road Loader is perfectly matched to scoop up and dispense sand into the Bruder Dump Truck for a most excellent creative play user experience.I have a 5 year old son who loves to play with construction sand toys . Essentially , he claims the Excavator is worthless . So much so , he asked me to return this birthday present ; that 's how really bad his experience was with the Excavator . But my son absolutely loves the Bruder Articulated Road Loader to get the same job done right . So go to that page and get the BRUDER ARTICULATED ROAD LOADER L574 & the BRUDER DUMP TRUCK 1:16 ratio . Again , this is the only one of three Bruder Loader that turns ; the others just go straight for a less than exceptional user experience.Now if your child has no intentions using this Excavator in the sand and play exclusively indoors with it , then this Excavator is an OK product for the price , but you still have the rotation and potential safety issues.MY FEEDBACK TO BRUDER & BRUDER USA is most of all be honest with your product capabilities in these videos and try not to set false expectations with the user experience ; your integrity is seriously damaged with me . Redesign the Plastic Tractor Belts and inserts using RUBBER Belts , put a double leaver directly on the shovel to aid in the scooping/digging process ( remember this is the primary function of the toy regardless of cost ) , eliminate or greatly minimize the swivel lock and get a more functional lock on the hood . Wish you still sold metal sand toys too , but I understand the multiple reasons why this is no longer practical .	-1
This toy breaks super super easy . It is very fustrating to my 3 yr old which in turn is fustrating to me . I would not buy this toy . Its a great idea but just does n't work .	-1
Very cool toy , but the forks seem to be fragile and broke quickly and easily rendering the toy somewhat useless . I sent an email to the manufacturer for a replacement part - will see if they fix it .	-1
Well forks slide alright . Within a day of getting it one fork slid right off and got lost . Now I have to order replacement forks probably from Germany ! Its fine to make them moveable but why do they need to slide off ? Does n't make sense , at least put a stop at the ends or something .	-1
My 3 yr. old LOVES construction vehicles , but this drum compactor is n't loved like a Rolly from Bob The Builder . It hardly ever gets played with . I do n't understand why the high reviews , there is n't much to this over-priced toy . The front/back roller drums spin , the fake steering wheel turns , and it has a pivot point in the middle . No sounds , no compartments to store things , zippo . If it is so realistic , why not allow the engine compartment to be seen ! ? ! I 'd be less annoyed if this was a $ 5 dollar item , but it is more than 3x that . Do your-self a favor and go to a garage sale and get 10+ toys for the price of this boring item .	-1
I bought two very nice sets for a school event ( actually , the high end sets with the tray and 18 color wheel ) . I was very impressed with the quality of the paints . They spread very nicely , the colors remain intense after drying , they are very economical in the sense that a little goes a long way . I also used some of their glitter and their paint brushes , all of which worked great.HOWEVER.There is a non-profit online , safe cosmetics , that has produced a report about the safety of these paints . Please investigate on your own ! Snazaroo has responded on their website , but I remain a bit skeptical . They state 'hazardous materials are beyond classification limit ' . In the second statement Snazaroo just says it adheres to the 'current legislative limits ' for lead , nickel and cobalt.I say take the nastiness out completely : I do n't want it on my kid 's face . LET 'S ERR ON THE SIDE OF CAUTION !	-1
Paint was very dry and difficult to get on sponges and apply to children 's faces , poor coverage . Sponges supplied are scratchy and not usable on a child 's face . I had a bag of make up sponges so I was still able to use the kit . Ca n't really reseal containers as they are just covered with thin plastic film not lids of any kind . I do n't know if I will be able to use kit again or if they will be completely dried out later . I placed entire pkg . in zip lock bag hope it helps . Washed off easily at the end of the night .	-1
it came dried out ... mixing water with it made it usable . doesnt wash easily ... ... not recommended to anyone . might get lucky ? o dunnoedit : lowered to 1 star because it actually made my kids break out ! ! shame .	-1
Ok , I hate my scene and I 'm here to tell you why . Well , for millions of reasons ! ! ! Here are 10:1.They are ugly2.They copied diva stars and bratz3.They are BORING ! ! ! ! 4.They are stoopid5.They are REALLY ugly6.No one likes them7.All they talk abot is FASHION , FASHION and FASHION8.Bratz are better than them9.Even my scene guys are ugly10.I HATE THEM ! ! ! ! # 1 MY SCENE HATER ! ! ! ! ! ! !	-1
The My Scene dolls are such posers ! They 're nothing but wanna'be Bratz ( and need I remind you that the Bratz are way cooler ! ) This Masquerade Madness doll is a copy of the Funk n ' Glow Bratz and she does n't even look half as pretty . Why ca n't Mattel just except the fact that `` Barbie 's Pink Reign of Idiotic Terror '' is OVER . GIVE UP MATTEL MY SCENE HAS NOTHING ON THE BRATZ DOLLS ! ~From : Kazami Ami a BRATZ fan	-1
How vulgar . These things are simply horrid . Get bratz , they are at least appropriate , unlike these cretures . Ugg , they act like bold , vulgar animals .	-1
Horrible , horrible hair ! If you think you have had a bad hair day before - wait til you see this head ! LOL Not worth the money . We took ours to Goodwill ( probably should have just put it in the trash . ) It was nothing like the one I had as a child . Not worth the money !	-1
This doll is a waste of money . The hair is impossible to comb or style . My daughter played with it for all of 10 minutes and it 's been stashed away in the basement ever since .	-1
My complaints echo the other ones already listed ; hair being a tangled mess and polish and make-up not working . My 5 year old daughter has only played with it a handful of times . She will get frustrated with the hair and give up . She was very disappointed when the nail polish did n't come off like it should have . And , even though she got it over a week ago , we still have n't gotten her hair completely detangled . Her favorite part is putting on the fake nails but I could have bought her a set of fake nails for a lot less money .	-1
If you are looking for play food that is like little tikes or fisher price , this is not it ! ! There is a reason you get 101 pieces for 19.99 ! ! These pieces are much smaller and made from a thinner cheaper plastic . Not at all what i expected from a quality company like step 2 . To top it off , this set does NOT come in a retail box but is cheaply packaged in plastic bags . I am sure my daughter does n't mind these are cheaply made or small but i sure as heck do . I could have bought a Kidconnection set from walmart for less money and maybe even of better quality !	-1
First I will say that this is not compatible if your TV has a DVD built into it as many new ones do . We had to hook this up in our bedroom so my son could play it . He played it for about 20 minutes , ( despite my encouragement to keep playing ) I even played to try and get him into it , but its just slow and pretty boring if you ask me . There wasnt enough action to keep him interested too long and it didnt always recognize the right discs . I think it may have been rushed to market . I put it away after he finished and figured I would suggest playing again the next day , but he didnt want to play . I kept it for another week or so , and he never mentioned it again , so I returned it and bought VSMILE .	-1
My son got this for his birthday from his aunt and everyone had a hard time pressing the keypad and getting the correct things to light up on screen and sometimes when I would put the Dora disk in , I would get Spongebob and when I restarted the dvd it got stuck on a loop and would play the beginning of the Spongebob song over and over . Technology is great but I think they have to keep working on this one if they want it to be as easy as the commercial presents it .	-1
We bought this toy for our daughter for Christmas and we were disappointed to discover that it is n't compatible with either of our dvd players . Our daughter was so disappointed because she wanted to watch and play the dora dvd ! I highly recommend you make sure your dvd player is compatible before purchasing this toy - even though I 'm not sure if it will do any good . We have a Marantz dvd player , and it is apparently compatible with this , yet we could n't get it to work . I 've read several reviews where children were disappointed because they could n't play with this toy ; I recommend setting this up to ensure it works before letting the kids see it !	-1
On Friday night , it was cold & snowy , I said to my 2 1/2 year old daughter , let 's go get that Interac TV at Target , that way we will have something fun to do for the weekend . Well ... later , we got the toy home , I put the dvd in my DVD player , and the DVD player gave an error message : '' the disk you have inserted is damaged . '' How could this be ? , I tried cleaning the `` brand new '' dvd , cleaning my dvd player , this could n't be happening . Two hours later , I was fed up . Saturday morning we exchanged the toy @ Target for another one . We got the toy home & put the disk in the DVD player , it worked ! ... until we went to program the controller ... the top left quadrant of the controller , did not work , at all ! I entered all 23 codes for my RCA Brand dvd player & none of them would make the top left part of the controller work . Two hours later , I accepted this toy is a dud ! So my disappointed 2 yr old & I returned the item to Target & got a refund . I spent 4 hours this weekend on this toy , when I could 've just read my daughter a book !	-1
At 2 yr old my son could work the DVD player , he could put his own movie in and get the remote and Know which buttons to push to skip the previews and get right to the movie . Now at 3 years old he has his own Play station 1 ; that he can play all by himself ! ! He puts in Winnie the pooh pre-school game and can play the Whole game without any help from me . When I saw the interactv DVD I thought this will be great , since it combines DVD and video game together he 'll love this.I setup it up in less then 5 minutes and hand him the controller , he only played for 10 minutes then turn it off and has n't touch it for Months . I ask him if he 'd like to play it again with me and he said `` no it 's boring you only match shapes '' so I sat down and played it by myself and I agree it is boring . First you have to watch the character do there little talk ( same talk every time you put the DVD in ) then you have to Match the shape on the pad , to the shape on the TV that is IT ! ! ! Not very challenging to someone who already knows all his letters , numbers and shapes . I also bought him sponge bob , Dora and Elmo plus the DVD that came with it and it 's All the Same ; Matching Shapes , except Sponge bob you do have to find the patty missing the pickle which of course is Not very hard , I see why my son finds it boring.He learns a lot more from his play station Winnie the pooh , like finding missing letters , counting numbers , painting , spelling , and Matching that is very challenging . If your child is already playing video games then the interactv is not for them . I agree with the other reviews if your child still does n't know their shapes or how to match then they 'll love interactv , that is until they learn their shapes .	-1
Well , I thought this would be a great idea for my son with autism . He has trouble holding a small device , so the larger interface and the large remote looked promising . Unfortunately , it never worked properly . After spending an hour to program it , it didnt read the cards properly . It was extremely frustrating and disappointing . It was a good idea that has n't been implemented well .	-1
This is a warning for this toy ! WARNING : This product contains chemicals known to the State of California to cause cancer and birth defects or other reproductive harm .	-1
My son loves this toy but after only 3 months the ear stopped working . It wo n't sing songs or say the body part or anything . And it has not been mistreated in any way and also has n't even been used all that much ( I rotate my son 's toys out every week so he does n't get tired of one thing ) . I must say I was very disappointed . Children 's toys should be made to last and this toy certainly fell short of that ! Be very careful when considering this toy for your little one . You may be wasting your money !	-1
My daughter received this toy as a gift . I thought it was really cute at first . But quickly became annoyed with it because the slightest touch sets of the different sounds . There is no way a child could learn anything from this toy because it switches from song to song with the slightest touch . I swear you could blow on the dogs ear and completely change the tune or the message . I do n't want to confuse my daughter so I do n't even give her this toy to play with anymore .	-1
This is a horrible toy . My two year old daughter got it as a birthday gift from her godfather , who bought it because of the fantastic reviews . It arrived broken -- one of the paw pad sensors does n't work unless you squeeze it just right , with two fingers . In the past Fisher Price has given me fantastic service , so I 'm sure they 'll take care of that problem when I get around to calling.The really terrible thing about this puppy is that when you hit a sensor , the toy stops whatever it was doing and starts a new thing . The sensors are super sensitive , and will go off if you just brush up against the toy . My daughter wants to hear the songs all the way through , and sing along , but of course she wants to be able to hold or touch the puppy at the same time . So the song stops , then it takes like five tries to cycle around to the song she wants , then she hugs the puppy and the song stops again . After about ten minutes of this she was in tears . I 've never see my little girl so distraught -- she 's not a kid who gets discouraged or cries much , but she just collapsed into my arms in tears of frustration . I felt awful for her.Other things I do n't like about it:1 . The `` this little piggy '' chant is turned into `` this little puppy , '' so now my daughter has started saying that , and I prefer the classic rhyme.2 . There 's a whole part that says `` blue ear , '' `` yellow foot , '' `` green hand , '' when you hit those body parts . But because it cuts off when you hit the sensors , it can sound like `` blue -- foot , '' when the foot is actually yellow . My daughter repeated `` blue foot , '' and I had to correct her.3 . It says `` I love you '' . I generally do n't like inanimate objects saying they love my child.If Fisher Price just made the slight change of having this puppy complete what he 's doing before starting the next activity , we 'd probably love it !	-1
My daughter does like this toy pretty well ( she is 16 months ) but I have put it away in a closet because it is too sensitive and with even slightly brushing against it when playing with it , it will start saying something else or playing a different song so it is difficult to endure . Also , it tends to `` go off '' all by itself , which is annoying if I am trying to put her down for a nap and all of the sudden the puppy , which is across the room with nothing touching it , suddenly makes a loud noise .	-1
Well , it is not his fault that he does n't work . At least the 2 that I ordered from Amazon did not . But they were nice about it and gave mea refund . Though a lot of people have bought them and were happy , there must be enough of the rejects to get Fisher-Price to drop it from their line . So I sent my hubby to Target to get one and he came back with one that worked but they were marked down half-priceso they are being phased out . Such a pity .	-1
My son has had this toy for several months and he 's not the least bit interested in it . Maybe he 's too young for it but he never plays with it . His friend has a my pal violet and she loves it though so I do n't think that 's the case . It does a lot more than this dog . Waste of money .	-1
This is one of the worst toys we were given four years ago . Why I still have it is a great mystery , because I have hated it from day one . My son never played with it , and my daughter hits the nose from time to time , or bumps into the thing , which causes a noisy symphony of unrelated half-songs to chirp from it -- and maybe a shrill bark . This toy limits pretend play . My children ca n't carry it around because it will continually blurt out the alphabet song , or `` ear '' or `` foot '' or some other obnoxious noise as long as it is being touched . The dog ca n't be turned off and then used as a normal plush toy because the battery pack inside it makes the belly of this thing hard , and makes the dog heavy as well ( for a one year old ) . However , I think if I HAD turned it off from day one my kids might have actually enjoyed it ( maybe ) , because it would not have been squawking at them every time they got near it . And the squawking is n't even pleasant . You get tired of it really fast . You know those pre-school music CDs you can buy ... you put them in your car 's sound system and immediately regret that decision . The songs on those CDs , just like the ones in this dog , are annoying , loud , and badly written ( Luckily `` They Might Be Giants '' has put out some actually decent and musically talented kids CDs , thank God ) . So this dog has always been on the side lines of the play room , because it is not useful unless the child wants an annoying radio that only completes bits and parts of its songs , because the buttons on the thing are too sensitive.Save yourself the cash and get a nice quiet quality teddy bear or rag doll . The kids will play with that alot more . You do n't need a talking dog to teach your child what a `` foot '' or an `` ear '' is called .	-1
We have this Learning Puppy and the Hug & Learn Baby Tad and I have to say the design of Tad is much better than the Puppy . The buttons on the Puppy are so sensitive that the slightest touch changes the song or the learning mode . The Tad needs a little bit of force ( but not so much force that a 4 month old ca n't push the buttons ) and so a song will normally complete itself and the modes do n't change as easily . I 'm glad that I got the Puppy as a buy one get one free sale and did n't pay full price for it . My son , who is now 6 months old , sees Tad as his friend . Do not recommend the Puppy .	-1
This toy is horrible . It is very sensitive to touch , annoying and creepy ! My daughter got it for her first Xmas when she was 3 months . At the time , she was pretty much immobile and enjoyed watching the light flash when I pushed it for her.Now , she carries it around and every time she bumps it , it switches to a different mode . Besides learning cause and effect by touching the buttons , I fail to see how hearing half of the ABC 's song is educational . Also , it says a lot of annoying phrases and has been know to randomly start talking when it 's not being played with.Do yourself a favor and get this : LeapFrog My Pal Scout ( Frustration Free Packaging ) orLeapFrog My Pal Violet ! For about the same price , you have a fully customizable toy that can be changed and altered for your child 's age and learning abilities . It properly says and spells my daughter 's name ( Risah ) ! The buttons are far less sensitive and the features can be changed once you get tired of hearing something for the ten thousandth time ! It also has a lullaby mode which we use every night as part of our bedtime routine .	-1
The dog itself is great . However , it tends to & # 34 ; talk & # 34 ; on its own . It 's creepy and annoying . I 'm not a fan .	-1
My baby is disinterested . If I stand the bear up his paws are super sensitive so while you are trying to teach tummy , it just turns off bc you just barely touched the foot.I 'm really frustrated with this so I am not going to type that much . What good is it , really ?	-1
My daughter was given this toy as a gift . To put it mildly , we do not like it . At all . It has this peppy , high-pitched female voice that just makes any normal adult grit their teeth . It 's just so sweet and insipid . Even worse is the sensitivity of this thing . If the cat farts near it , it starts singing or proclaiming , `` I love you . '' It 's also deceptively difficult to turn off . The bottom of one foot is a 3-way switch for power or to switch between singing and learning modes . The switch sucks . It 's impossible to know if you 've turned it off correctly . Like the other 1 Star Reviewers , I have had infuriating and terrifying experiences with this thing coming alive at night and beginning to speak without warning.In my parental experience thus far , Fisher Price normally has solid products . This is an exception . If there is a toy hell , this puppy belongs there .	-1
I bought this for my daughter when she was around 18 months . She was interested in it at first , but her attention soon wavered . I want to add that I have a high tolerance for annoying toys , but this is one was too annoying for me ! It would go off randomly , even after I had turned it off . She was much more interested in the Leapfrog Violet Dog doll than this one .	-1
Okay . My son has had this for over a year now . He goes through periods where he does n't look at it for months , then wants to take it everywhere . But , it is a super annoying toy and I would be just as happy to `` lose '' it in the next toy rotation.One - the sensor is super duper sensitive . A strong breeze can turn the darn thing on.Two - I do n't like how once a kid has put it down , it keeps chiming up trying to lure the kid back to the toyThree - This puppy is super needy . It is always asking for hugs and wanting to know if you love it . It seems like it is gearing them up for having an insecure girlfriend/boyfriend later in life.Four - as for being educational , you ca n't understand what it is saying half the time , and the songs are hard to play along to . No more educational than using a regular doll to teach hands , feet , ears , etc ... As you can tell , I 'm not a big fan of this toy . Spend your money on something quieter .	-1
The only thing your child will learn from this toy is frustration and how to say `` Bye , Bye . '' The one/off button is located on the foot of the dog which is ultra sensitive . You barely set the dog down and you will `` Bye , bye '' and again by just the blow of the wind it will turn back on , `` It 's learning time ! '' This has to be the most annoying and useless toy I have ever bought for my son . I give it two stars because it is cute and a cute idea , it just does n't work !	-1
Although this toy is cute in appearance , it has many drawbacks . We actually received 2 for our daughter last Christmas . One never worked properly . The one we kept is ultra sensitive as another review states . If you barely touch any part , it will switch songs or features mid-song . Even our daughter looks at us as if to ask what 's wrong with the toy . It also seems possessed as the toy goes off on its own often even when shut off . In the middle of the night it can be heard saying `` blue ear '' . This is one of those toys as a parent that you wish were never in your house . The concept is great , but find another toy that has less glitches .	-1
I 'll admit outright that i 'm not big on battery-operated toys . I take the batteries out of almost every gift given to my 1-year-old . This toy may be one of the most annoying for the two minutes it took me to deactivate it . The voice is syrupy-sweet , downright cloying.As many other reviews have mentioned , it 's also extremely sensitive . The lightest touch makes the puppy start singing or talking . ( However , for the people who like this toy except for the fact that it 'll randomly start singing in the middle of the night , there is a physical off switch under the shirt in the back . Turn it off at bedtime , and your problem is solved . ) Lastly , the reason i 've taken this toy away even though it has no batteries anymore : New York Public Interest Research Group found that this toy has high levels of bromine and low levels of mercury , both toxic . I did n't like seeing my kid hug and chew on this toy knowing it contains toxic elements .	-1
The power button or on off button very sensitive and in the worst spot . It is on the foot so when my son plays with it and a song cones on , if he barely touches the foot it stops and says goodbye ! ! !	-1
I WAS SO EXCITED TO GET THIS FOR MY 8 MONTH OLD DAUGHTER AFTER I HAD READ ALL THE WONDERFUL REVIEWS AND ESPECIALLY BECAUSE SHE LOVES MUSIC AND SONGS LIKE `` ITSY BITSY SPIDER '' ... .BUT I WAS SO UPSET WHEN I GOT IT HOME AND TOOK THE PLASTIC PIECE OUT THAT MAKES IT GO FROM DEMO MODE IN THE STORE TO REGULAR PLAY AND IT STILL ONLY PLAYS A FEW WORDS OF EACH SONG AND THEN STOPS ! ! MY DAUGHTER STARTS TO CLAP AND SMILE WHEN SHE HEARS THE SONGS AND THEN GETS UPSET B/C IT ENDS SO ABRUPTLY . EX : IT SINGS `` THE ITSY BITSY SPIDER CLIMBED UP THE WATER SPOUT '' THEN STOPS AND SINGS `` DO YOU EARS HANG LOW , DO THE WOBBLE TO AND FRO '' THEN STOPS . I EXPECTED TO HEAR THE WHOLE SONG . WE 'VE HAD IT 1 WEEK NOW AND SHE JUST CRAWLS RIGHT PAST IT AS I THINK IT UPSETS HER MORE THAN ANYTHING . I 'M GOING TO CALL FISHER PRICE TO SEE IF THIS WAS A DEFECTIVE PRODUCT OR IF IT WAS DESIGNED THAT WAY .	-1
The spinner that is attached to the base is a very poor idea . First , it works poorly as a spinner , second and most important , is that it is very important to not move the tree base when the game is about delicate balancing of hanging monkeys . Slight movements , like trying to turn a poorly designed spinner , will many times cause the tree hanger , and all of the monkeys , to drop down .	-1
Just okay . Magnetic canopy of tree is meant to fall after enough weight has been place . Do not play on nice furniture ! The manual spin thing does not really spin so it kind of makes it pointless to play . I would not suggest this game for advanced toddlers .	-1
Not much functionality . Some of the other drums I bought before had a lot more functionality and educational value to them	-1
I do n't know if I had a defective product , but you have to hit the top of the drum quite hard and with a large surface area ( i.e . your whole palm ) to get a sound . Even as an adult I could n't make the drum respond every time . It would be nearly impossible for my 6 month old baby to play with it in a satisfactory manner . Returned .	-1
Looks nice in concept , but my 10 months old baby did n't like it that much and it did n't help her learning to crawl !	-1
I purchased this game in hopes to take it on a trip to islands . After it arrived , I opened it up to discover that while the box is small , the board is not only literally as big as the box , but also one flat board . This is not portable and would be easy to break in a luggage bag . A foldable board would be more & # 34 ; Portable & # 34 ; . I would only recommend this board if you are traveling by car to your destination . Otherwise , not worth your time . I still gave two stars because despite the size , it is an amazing game !	-1
I recently purchased a higher end kitchen set for my daughter 's 5th birthday and was on the hunt for appliances ( microwave , blender , toaster , mixer , etc ) . This looks like the real deal however I should have trusted the other reviews and gone with my gutt instinct . In my opinion , it 's not worth the money as the turn table stopped working within 2 minutes of opening the gift .	-1
By the other reviews I 've read ( this is July 2013 ) , I see this is a hit-or-miss product . It 's very realistic-looking and super lightweight . I 'm just disappointed . Right away we unpackaged and I was going to wrap for my daughter , but in trying it out , it was immediately faulty ; the light turned on and buttons worked , but it had an extremely loud motor - it just did n't sound safe . I 've seen one child 's review of this on YouTube and his sounds quieter . He seems very happy with his and gave a real cute reviewer ; it 's worth seeing . I returned this item . Anyway , just beware .	-1
The set had no storage box nor stand . Loose to keep but seems alright still .	-1
This toy was a mistake right out of the box..In other words , it did n't work right out of the box . My daughter and I were so disapointed , do n't waste your money even if it is only 10 $ , which is what I paid for it ... ... ... ... ..	-1
We too are disappointed with this toy . Ours did n't make it 2 weeks without breaking . The toys are so cheaply made these days for the price . The horse was the only good item in the box .	-1
It comes with a nice pony that Strawberry and her friends can sit astride , but the other props are paper or cheap plastic . The stable is n't even a nice `` set '' to place in front of because it is rickety and does not find together . We finally got out our old Little People Farm ( 90 's ) and let Honey Pie and the gang hang out in a sturdy plastic barn . It might not be to scale , but the gate works ! !	-1
I read the reviews for this salon and I thought I would give it a try anyway , thinking it is only $ 10 . Unless you do n't have Honey Pie already do n't buy this toy ! Honey Pie is perfect and the accessories are cute . However , there are only a few . There are lots of accessories on the box that do n't actually come with the toy and the box does n't list what is inside . There is a shopping cart on the box , it is not included ! The hinges for the salon are small and not strong enough to hold this toy together . Move it an inch and the whole salon collapses . This is the worst toy I have ever purchased ! I took it back and bought my daughter the My Little Pony `` Twinkle Twirl 's Dance Studio '' 100 % better !	-1
How dissapointing ! ! ! This toy is so cute but if you look at it wrong it falls apart . THe design is also very weird and it is not easy to play with . My SSC but pass on this one unless on sale for really really cheap .	-1
Seems cool when you look at it . You think `` my kid is gon na be a master electrician after he/she plays with this ! '' But , my kid looked at it and just ended up playing Star Wars with it and I could 've bought some Star Wars toys if he wanted those and they would n't have cost me $ 100 smackeroos ! Not durable either , as I type my son is snapping off little plastic things on it . Just save your money and send them to college or take them to a museum or discovery center with it instead of buying all these products which do n't do anything but sit around and collect dust .	-1
Like : adjustable heightfairly easy to assemble if you read the directions and an extra handthe clipsthe traysthe colorful knobsthe paper roll option is handy and the cutterdo n't like : the blackboard does n't work well despite my chaulking it up ( priming it ) as I read . I plan on painting it and hope that works.the paper with the same brand does n't fit length wise but I can live with that.The clips do n't fit along the sides near the bottom half ( because it 's too thick ) as I preferThere are only 3 adjustable heights , thought there might be more.In hindsight , I would have to gotten another similar one . But not worth it to return and replace it at this point .	-1
Too bad I could not send this back in time for Christmas morning , but I did n't bother to put it together until Christmas Eve.Negatives : The dry erase board has air pockets in the corners underneath the clear sheet of plastic , and it makes it a rough surface.The bottom part of the stand ( the legs ) are warped and bent inward and outwards , which makes the whole thing a bit wobbly and it looks crooked.The pre-drilled holes for the dry-erase board did not line up too well , and I had to force one of the bolts through.Positives : Easy to build . Took me about 20 minutes while watching t.v.Knobs and bolts make it a sturdy build , other than the wobbly legs.Plastic trays are big and sturdy.Cleans easily ( but if you get marker on the wooden parts , it is there to stay . )	-1
For a child 's easel , this is indeed nicely made . However , consider the `` very similar '' : DMelissa & Doug Deluxe Standing Easel ; compare the difference in value for yourself .	-1
I was pretty excited to get this . We have many M & D ; toys , and we usually love them . In most cases it seems the designers think of everything . That does not hold true for this product . Other reviewers have covered these these points , so I 'll try to be brief.1 . The chalkboard is terrible . I will be buying some chalkboard paint to make it usable ( adding to the cost ) .2 . The white board does not wipe clean well . It stains easily from all the dry erase marker types I have tried , so I have to use the dry erase spray ( again more $ - though I may try the rubbing alcohol someone else mentioned ) .3 . I wish the white board ( or chalkboard ) was magnetic . It would really add a lot to the toy and I 'd have all the letters off my fridge ! 4 . The height is not very easily adjustable , and it does not seem so easy to fold though I have n't really tried yet.5 . The plastic trays seem to add a lot to the stability , but they do not seem to be made from very strong plastic . I am hoping they will last a while , but I 'm not too optimistic . If/when they break , I think we 'll have to add some wood to reinforce it.Overall , I think I could have found a better easel . The chalk and whiteboard on the IKEA easel work very well ( know others that have it ) , but I do n't know whether or not IKEA 's is magnetic . Some of the plastic ones are and I 'd really like that feature . If there was a way to add that myself ( like chalkboard paint ) I might consider it . You may want to shop around more . It 's a large item , so more versatility is always better if it 's going to be taking up a lot of space.Overall , my biggest complaint is that it has 2 poor quality writing surfaces . Without the paper , it 's not very usable . I hope this helps . ***update 12/11 : still have n't figured out how to fold it up , at least not reasonably easily , so it takes up a ridiculous amount of space .	-1
I have a child who loved this easel , and played with it every day just about . she is gentle as a 2.5yr old can be , and now she is about to turn four and im searching for a NEW easel because this one has absolutely fallen apart . the yellow/green/blue knobs have all cracked and broken off , the wood mid pieces where the paper roll was to sit have both broken off.. i mean , this did not hold up AT ALL . the most movement it got was transporting from bedroom to living room . i feel like for the price , i should have gotten much more than a year and a half of heavy use out of this.also , after a few months , the white board stopped erasing completely and the chalkboard takes a wash down with a wet rag between uses as well , the eraser is useless.I expected more from melissa and doug and now i 'm unsure where to look for something higher quality -- anyone with helpful tips please let me know	-1
Many reviews have noted `` Great for the price ! '' but Ikea has one for thirteen dollars less and the same/better quality ( although lacking the other tray ) so my review will not be based on `` Great for the price . '' The chalkboard had a HUGE gash on it straight out of the box . The way the box was packaged and intact it had to have happened before it was shipped.. somewhere on the assembly line . After reading many reviews prior to purchase I thought I might as well just buy the chalkboard paint and fix the gash myself . For anyone doing this themselves the chalkboard paint was kind of a fiasco from my experience since it came out all uneven ( waited ... sanded ... sprayed again ... ugh ) .. but you may be a better spray-painter than I . Nevertheless my two star rating will not be based on my painting fiasco . Rather , it is based on the quality . Many places the cheap wood is badly cracked and came that way out of the box ( mostly where the pre-drilled holes are ) . Some wood became cracked when the screws were tightened ( believe me.. I did n't tighten that much ) . Just for reference , I can put a scratch in the wood with my fingernail . When you fold it up to store the product the red wood pieces on the side of the easel dig into the natural wood causing it to chip off.Does my child love it ? Yes YES YES ! ! ! Will it last more than a month or two ? No.My opinion : If you live near an Ikea you may want to check out theirs . At least if theirs breaks you wo n't feel as bad for the price.Side note : The bundled easel paper Amazon is marketing with this easel is not the right width for this easel . My child is a bit older and is more controlled and careful with his art.. a younger child may end up painting all over the easel making clean up more of a chore .	-1
My ds received this for Christmas . It has only been a month and ds put the weebles in hiding . I have checked everywhere and there is no sight of them . Also , the spinning motions of it barely move . I have played more with this toy than ds has . I have been trying to get him to play with it , but it is n't fun . This one thing that does n't do anything , I do n't know if it is suppose to make them bob up and down , or spin . The ball popper ds received last Christmas is much more fun , and interactive than this is . I am so glad I did n't pay $ 20 for it .	-1
do not purchase this if you live in the city . the car is big . you need plenty of room for your child to drive this around and it goes faster than you might think and it makes plenty of noise . i bought this for my 3 year old grandson ; steering the car is not that easy , putting his foot on the pedal and just foward is easy enough but he has to bend down to the floor of the car to hit the button to go in reverse and then hit it again to go foward . but , beware , it does go ! ! and if there is n't open space it will go into anything in the way . I think a foot pedal car is a much better idea for a child .	-1
We have about 10 bruder trucks this one just has a poor design . My son had a logging truck with a grapple attachment at the top of his list this Christmas . A week later the side gates are broken on both sides and he does n't play with the crane piece at all because the mechanism is too much work . He just holds the grapple in his hand and lifts the logs which are hard plastic and mostly just slide out of the truck . The & # 34 ; chains & # 34 ; have been discarded too since they are really hard to snap on and off . Maybe for a 10 year old with patience this would work but design just seems lacking and the fact that the clips that hold the gates on broke so easily is a shame and not up to bruder standards .	-1
We gave this to my 18 month old daughter as a Christmas gift and thought it was really cute on the box . It really lacks sturdiness but she finds it enjoyable to push around the house . The cardboard boxes are so flimsy I 'm not even sure they lasted a whole day . The banana , muffin and milk carton are fun to play with . Our twin 3 1/2 year old boys love this cart as well . They run through the house and it winds up crashing and coming completely apart . That 's a boy thing ! The seat for the baby is too small for a standard size doll to fit into and be taken out without this seat coming off the cart . The idea of this cart is cute but overall I 'd look for something with more guts to it -- something that 's made better and will not fall apart when you look at it .	-1
This is the worst toy cart I have ever seen ! First , the toys that are included are NOT as pictured here or on the box ! The veggies ended up being these weird little green and orange circle things . They remind me of upside down Trivial Pursuit pieces ! And I have yet to figure out why they even include the cardboard boxes of food in these sets ... they are the first thing that our 16 month old destroys ! But she does LOVE the `` pouring milk '' and `` peeling banana '' ! And I have to admit those are really cool.My next complaint is the baby doll . It is NOT included and I wish we had n't bought it . It 's a great doll on it own and our daughter loves her . But add the cart to the mix and she hates her . The doll is darn near impossible to get in and out of the seat . We have to help her every time . She finally traded her out for a cheaper and smaller one that she can get in and out herself.Our final complaint is the cart itself . It is very cheaply constructed . The basket comes off all the time . It just doe not hook on right . I thought it was a really cute idea until I realized it would n't stay on . Plus the handle falls down often and it is the perfect size for our daughter to get her hand stuck under . The next flaw in the cart is the baby seat . Not only does the doll not fit properly but the seat itself also falls off . It 's just like the basket . So most times our daughter is just pushing around the frame of this thing.I would not suggest this cart . Go with a good old Little Tikes or Step 2 cart instead . You wo n't get all extra stuff but you 'll get a far better cart .	-1
The Doodle Pro Basic is GREAT . This one ( Little People ) is not.Here 's why : * Magnets in the shape stampers are so strong my son could not get the shapes out of their resting spots . * The pen tip is so short you have to write holding the pen at an exact 90 degree angle to the board . * The string that attaches the pen to the board does not move very freely . * The eraser ( sliding soccer ball ) is so hard to move that my son can not move it . * Little Eddie 's foot and one of the balloons takes up some of the drawing area. [ ... ]	-1
I just finished calling customer service about this toy and they 're sending me a voucher to purchase a different model as it 's substandard to me and my son . ( UPDATE : I have now purchased the `` Doodle Pro Basic '' model and it is infinitely easier for my son to use ; we are all happy ! ) Good : -Not electronic toy that kids enjoy-EDUCATIONAL.-Only a little effort by the child and they have a `` drawing '' -Does n't have annoying sounds ( quiet toy ) -Promotes doodling-Keeps crayons/markers off walls , shirts , rugs , tables in this messy young stage.-The shapes were easy to use for instant effect , he made many `` pictures '' with shapes only.-Fisher Price customer service is top notch.- ( Update ! ) my son drew his first non-scribble drawing ever on here : a big truck ! ! Bad : -The pen is corded . Even though I risked loosing the pen I cut it off from the string immediately as it was impossible to use for him . They said they have to abide by strangulation rules , so there 's not much they can do.-Magnets are way too strong ( triangle , circle , square ) - he was enraged many times and frustrated he could n't get them out.-The soccer ball slider is very hard to push for young hands , even an almost 3 year old.-The slider has to go over a 'virtual hump ' and it 's gotten harder to use even for me , it took some paint off the plastic too.-No matter how many 'wipes ' with the slider the surface shows ghosting and gets worse over time.-Now that I look at it , it 's tacky looking ( sorry ) . The huge boy with balloons sticking out is n't necessary . They should have just painted it on versus making them protrude.-The pen must be perfectly written with in a top-down fashion or it writes poorly because of the magnet . Kids write at an angle and this wo n't pick up on that.So in summary pass on this specific Doodle Pro and pick another one , as I will . I LOVE the idea but this execution is quite poor .	-1
I was so excited to get this toy , and when i finally found it I was overjoyed . When I got it home , I noticed the blocks and words were not matching up . The train would say car and vice versa . It turned out to be a big 50.00 piece of junk that took up too much room ! It was returned the next day !	-1
We got this last night and we are very dissappointed . We really love the peek-a-blocks , but this item was a waste of money . The motor is too loud to hear the music , even on the loudest volume . The blocks fall out of the stackeron their own , or wo n't fall out when you push the button . The orange door on the sorter will not stay shut . The stickers that are already on , were'nt on well , and the ones you put on , well you 'd better get them on right the first time or they will not come off to fix . I hope they come out will a better model for less money because until then , I do n't want one . We have EVERY peek-a-block set there is , but this is the only one that needs to go back to the drawing board . We took this back the very next day .	-1
This toy is boring and not well assembled ! I purchased this $ 50 toy because I thought it would be educational for our daughter - sticking blocks in holes , and a variety of other fun things to do with blocks ! Not so . The `` special block '' on the top only announces its name as you press the button , and the revolving spinny thing ( on our model ) is grinding , after only 7 days of play . The side that you drop the blocks into ( the storage container looking thing ) keeps opening , so not all the blocks actually stay in , and I agree with a previous reviewer ... .you can only drop 6-8 blocks into the `` lever '' side before they all dump out . Not worth the money !	-1
This is the 1st Fisher Price toy that has diappointed us , it is also the most expensive one we have tried.Pros : -Steady enough for baby 's just learning to stand.-Nice sort bin with storage for many blocks.Cons : -The stack and spill side does not work consistently , sometimes the blocks spill even without pushing the button.-The mirror on one side is film not plastic so ours was distorted and my child could not see himself in it.-The carosel on top needs a cover as others have mentioned . Also the motor on it is louder that the music.-It is not age appropriate for a 6 month old.-The blocks spilling into the cube is very loud.Overall I think I would have been better off getting the Laugh and learn House .	-1
My 2 year old has not played this for long . The carasoul needs battery change very often though we have not used often . Maybe I like this toy more than my toddler does . Nice and big but babies easy grow out of it .	-1
The pieces were just too hard for her to hold . We bought a cheap set that did n't have any special features and she loves that more than this . This would be good for a 2 year old , or maybe even older . Small hands ca n't handle the pieces .	-1
The little boy who received this truck just loves it because he SO wanted a snowplow truck for a long time . The plow part however falls off from normal , gentle play very easily . The top doors on the dump part ( where the salt would go ) also fall off . The truck itself is okay , though the plastic is very inexpensive . The size is great and that is what you are paying for I guess ... just to have the nice big size.Over all because the little boy who received this just loves this truck and plays with it a lot , he also has to get the plow fixed very five minutes or will play with it without the plow attached .	-1
We own several of the Bruder trucks . This one is the poorest quality of the bunch . The red hatches on the back broke off within the first hour . The plow has now broken off too . Overall , the plastic is much more flimsy than the other Bruder trucks.My son loved it , but I was really disappointed with the quality .	-1
This toy was purchased as a Christmas gift for my 3 yr old son who is very gentle on his toys . It never got much play -maybe because the front shovel falls off all the time or the skinny plastic `` pins '' that hold the doors in place on top of the back broke so they just sit on top and no longer open and close as they should . It looks like a really cool toy , but do you think they could make it more sturdy so kids can actually PLAY with it ? ? ?	-1
If these were priced at $ 4.00 - it would be worth the investment . These produce a tinny sound - irritating to adult and child alike . Investigate zils ( finger cymbals ) instead for a clear ringing sound .	-1
I returned this product . The sound quality is acceptable only when it is played while being held in an upright position , which may be difficult for very young children due to the size of the drum . The sound quality is very poor when it is played while on a flat surface such as a table .	-1
I was a rock musician during the fun days , so I know what a decent drum is supposed to sound like . Kids wo n't know the difference , but this drum has an annoying metallic sounding resonance , somewhat like hitting a large tin can . I purchased this based on the raving reviews , and it is completely puzzling how so many people would miss mentioning the resonance ( are all the reviews real ? ) . I know this is a kid product and not for professionals , but the product description talks about the `` enhanced low-pitched fundamentals . `` The drum sticks are nice though.I will try the larger diameter Remo Kids gathering drum to see if perhaps those do n't have the ringing overtones .	-1
I got this for my four year old for Christmas last year . It was really nice looking . We put it up and it lasted all of a few minutes before it fell apart . Where the doors are is a very thin piece of cardboard and it came apart very easily . After opening the doors a couple of times the house fell apart ! Then it was no good of course . NOT worth the money we paid for it and my daughter was heart broken because she was really looking forward to playing with it .	-1
It came and some of the wood is warped which I suppose may straighten out once I get it together but the hardware kit ( 10 screws and allen wrench ) did not come in the box . I have a very disappointed little girl on my hands and for the kind of money I shelled out for a doll house I should n't need to research and hunt around to find the correct hardware . ! 00 % dissatisfied .	-1
Our son was given this last year for Christmas . At the time , he was much too young for it , so I put it away until he was about 9 months old . It does work with an easy touch . So easy , in fact , that I believe if the wind blew hard on one of the books it would play about 5 different noises . At nearly 15 months old , he still does n't understand that he needs to touch gently or have the coordination to touch one small spot.Do yourselves a favor and sit down with your children and READ real books to them instead of wasting your money on this product . I think they get more out of it .	-1
I agree with the reviewers here - Power Touch for babies is WAY TOO SENSITIVE ! My 1 year-old ( like any other infant ) slides his hands on the book and touches everything as we sit together to read with this system . In addition to the sensitivity , there are too many objects on each page that make sounds , sing melodies , or say words . The result is we hear a continuous and steady string of mixed-up garbled half words and both of us become frustrated . On the two or three occasions that we have sat down to read , I gave up , took the book out , and read it to him . However , the books are kind of boring without the sounds ... so ya just ca n't win with this system . I finally decided to put the thing up for a few months and try again later . Though this is an awesome concept , it is poorly designed . I do not recommend purchasing this product . All the parents here were right , and I should have taken their advice ! We have n't tried the Leap Frog yet so I ca n't totally recommend it , but I 'm definitely going to check it out . The Power Touch system is too difficult for the age recommended , and would probably be more suitable for infants over 1 year . Hope this helps you out .	-1
This review is for the Quercetti Skyrail Mini Rail Rollercoaster , 150 Pieces , which is model 6430 . I have a seven year old , and my wife and I were looking for a marble run that he could build by himself , or with minimal parental input . ( He likes to be able to build things without any help . ) We were looking at some of the more elaborate and expensive Quercetti models , but decided to go with this more basic model to see how we liked it before moving on to the bigger ones . Below are my impressions of this toy.Pros : - Relatively easy to snap together- A neat conceptCons : - As several other reviewers have noted , the instruction manual is for multiple models , and what 's worse , it combines the skimpy coverage for this model with another model , does n't really offer any detailed examples to build for this set . While you can free-form build runs , I strongly think that you need a couple of examples for your child to follow for their first efforts so that they can become comfortable with the toy . I went to Quercetti 's web site hoping to find more examples , but all I found was a picture of a run , which I printed off and built.- It 's not very stable , and will collapse easily.- It 's difficult to do very much without the marble jumping off of the track . Part of the fun , I suppose , is experimenting to find just the right angles and speeds for the marbles , but the track does n't offer very fine control adjustments- The small , black connectors are hard to get apart , and the track connectors are somewhat flimsy.Overall , this is a good idea , but it falls short in reality . The manual is poor , the toy is n't as user friendly as it could be , and for my boy , it 's more frustrating than fun . Two stars .	-1
I thought this car was supposed to move ! It does n't do anything but honk , which it only does once after I take out the batteries , replace them , and then put the little man into his seat . After that it just sits there . My LO does n't even look at this toy , much less try to play with it . She learned after the first few tries that her efforts were futile , however I keep trying . What a joke ! Do n't bother .	-1
I 'm returning these , they are way too small for my little chef ! plus the egg carton will break very easily .	-1
These eggs are even smaller than the dismal eggs at the grocery store today . Made of wood and too small to be safe for the children . I hid our from the boys .	-1
Was very disappointed in the size of these eggs . Not very realistic unless you like quail eggs . I think they were a bit too expensive and probably would not buy them again . My daughter played with them maybe 2 times before she lost interest .	-1
I bought this over a year ago for my toddler . The carton tore apart within a week . The eggs do not look at all real . They 're little wooden ovals painted white , and they are tiny . This is a total waste of money , it 's absurd they charge this much . The carton is not even as durable as a real egg carton . Do n't waste your money !	-1
When I opened the package it had a weird scent like vinegar . My son likes the eggs but I thought they would be a little bit bigger so you really have to watch your child while he/she plays . They are smaller then a golf ball and about the size of a strawberry . So never leave your child alone . They are made of wood so are durable . Me and my son use them for his speech therapy which we focus on counting . He also used them to pretend play with a little pan we have for him so he liked that he was making `` eggs ''	-1
These eggs are great quality & nicely finished , but they are too small ! I was shocked at how small they are . The description says that they are about 2 inches in length , but I measured mine , and they are closer to 1.5 inches . They are definitely a choking hazard for a child . They are also surprisingly pointy - not rounded like eggs you eat . I , unfortunately , have to return these & buy another brand that makes larger , more life-like eggs .	-1
Ok , so I have other Haba food items and I expected this to be the same scale , but this thing is so tiny it 's better suited for a dollhouse ! ( Ok , so a bit of an exaggeration , but this is smaller than the fruits and veggies that Haba makes . ) What gives ? Why would I want a milk carton that is smaller than the veggies in my children 's play kitchen ? I want to return this but it 's not worth the shipping cost .	-1
I received my order today , and discovered ( as with all of the Hasa products in my order ) that although more than one item is pictured -- only one comes with the order . The item itself is very small , 2 1/2 '' X 1 '' . That , fine , I can accept since the cost was under two dollars and since the item is made of wood , lifesize would make play a work-out for most children . However , shipping only one without a clear statement that each order is for ONE item and does not include all the items in the photograph is false advertising .	-1
The milk container is so small we refer to it as the creamer . We purchased another milk container that is more life size and this is the creamer when she makes her pretend coffee . It often get 's lost in the play food basket because it is so small . Would be nice if it were a few inches taller and wider .	-1
If you order this item as I did , you will receive one potato -- not three . I did n't expect an entire sack full for less than two dollars , but did expect to receive three as advertised in the photo ! The potato itself is about 2 '' long , so wo n't take up much space in your child 's limited kitchen storage space .	-1
I almost threw these out with the packaging that Amazon sent them in . These are SO tiny . My daughter loves pretend food but these are so small , I 'm concerned they will be forgotten during playtime . The tin is smaller than the palm of my hand , so then you can only imagine how tiny the actual pieces are . It 's adorable , but very small . I would probably purchase another pastry/dessert set before buying this .	-1
These are really small . It does state & # 34 ; 3+ & # 34 ; but even at that age , it is teeny tiny ( Ill post a picture ) . The box stays in a palm hand.I paid $ 8.54 which is supposed to be a mark down from original price of $ 25 . No way this is worth $ 25 . It is good quality but $ 9 is a fair price .	-1
Again , I purchased a wooden toy to discover that it is bulky . As well , the flimsy strings which attach the paper holder absolutely can not remain tied rendering the teabag useless.No , I would not recommend these .	-1
I bought these for my daughter to play tea party . They are small ... .they break quickly and have small pieces that my little one could choke on . These are too small for any family with kids under 3. Who cares that I bought it for an older kid ... .just too small .	-1
My original review of this product was quite favorable . While these blocks are among my son 's favorite things to play with , I do have concerns now that we 've had the blocks for several months ( under HEAVY use ) . First , the hat on the little person is not secure . Ours fell off and would have posed a huge choking threat to our son if we had n't grabbed it in time . We will not be reattaching the hat - we 'll just `` retire '' that toy . Second , we have noticed cracking in several of the blocks . Any cracks in a wooden product such as this will harbor bacteria from moisture ( similar to wooden cutting boards ) . Since these blocks are only meant to be wiped clean with a damp cloth , there is no way to get them very clean . That in itself should have been a big red flag for us when we first bought them . Think about how much moisture they came into contact with from our son 's saliva alone . In hindsight , NOT GOOD . Finally , I read the review about this product on healthystuff.org ( thanks to G_Girl 's recommendation ) and it does get a high rating for toxicity . That was the icing on the cake for us . These blocks will all be retired now . It is a shame , too , because they really were a big hit here . They did cost a lot ... I figured the Haba reputation meant that they were safe . I should have dug a little deeper I guess .	-1
I am so disappointed after spending almost $ 200 on this product . We can not , can not , can not put the thing together . The instructions are written in space alien language , and we have been pounding away at the thing all day . Back to the manufacturer .	-1
My son has a castle that he loves and when his cousin comes over he plays all the time with the castle . For my nephew 's pbithday I puchased him this castle . It is different from son 's ( his castle is one piece ) . I understood that this castle had different pieces and that it was n't one piece . I did also think the pieces would be held together in some way - they are n't . Every time we get the castle set up the pieces fall over if you play with the castle.I am soo disappointed . This is one time where paying less money for a one piece castle would have been a much better bet.Now , after one month , the castle sits in its box unplayed with . The drawbridge connector also broke off and had to be glued .	-1
First I have to admit that I bought this for my 3 year old , so maybe we are out of our league and he will eventually grow into it . The fact that the pieces do not slide together or interlock at all really ticks him off . He barely plays with the castle at all honestly . Maybe something to grow into but for now , not worth the money . Maybe at some point we will have enough dedicated space to mount it to something but its a pretty large piece .	-1
I purchased this because I was under the impression that there were three bells in a set . Given the three bells in the photo , can you blame me ? I suppose ti should have read the fine print . The title does afterall state `` Bell '' not `` Bells '' . Oh well ... I will definitely be sending this back . I can not justify spending this money on one bell .	-1
I bought this stroller because it was recommended by Consumer Reports . What a joke . I wonder if the Consumer Reports reporter was a shareholder of Graco prior to making the recommendation for this stroller . I regret spending so much money on this thing . It 's heavy , awkward to maneuver at times , takes up a lot of space , reclining mechanism not easy to adjust , and weak wheel pins . I made a temporary repair to the wheel pin after the back wheel fell off during a walk - boy , was that ever a pain in the butt inconvenient . I will have to call graco for a replacement pin . I should n't have relied so much on Consumer Reports and relied more on my own practical needs .	-1
This is worthless . A flimsy , poorly-designed piece of crap . What a waste of my time . word word word word word	-1
Although the adjustable height and reclining features seem nice , in reality I have used them only once or twice . The main problem with this high chair is that the food goes everywhere but the tray . The tray does n't go in far enough ( despite having `` 4 positions '' ) , so there is a large gap between baby and tray where food goes . Food also goes between the cloth pad and the plastic chair , all over the buckle , on the main tray ( instead of the removeable tray ) , etc . It 's sometimes nice to have a removeable tray , but when food gets all over the main tray , there 's no point.Buy a simpler high chair with less `` features '' you will never use .	-1
My review is n't as dramatic as the others but I do agree that this chair is n't exactly the best way to spend your money . I got it as a gift and it is good enough for the time being.My son is almost 10 months old and is discovering that the tray can become dislodged if he pushes hard enough with his feet . My solution to that was to put the tray in the hall closet for safe-keeping and adjust the height so now he just sits with us at the kitchen table . It is no harder to clean the table after he is done than it is to clean those stupid bulky trays.In addition , the seat cover gets disgusting constantly and must be washed a million times a day ( which is just so impractical for us busy moms ) . And it is true , it is held on by tiny elastic loops that fit into the smallest holes known to man on the bottom of the chair . I would like to know who thought of that brilliant design ? Food does fall down into little cracks and crevices . It is very hard to clean the seat ( bad design yet again ) . I use the vacuum cleaner hose to suck most of it out and sometimes I even throw it in the shower ! That is n't the easiest thing to do because the chair is bulky.My suggestion is if you have an IKEA near you , they have awesome , simply designed high chairs for $ 18.99 without a tray and $ 23.99 with a tray . You ca n't beat it ! They are easy to clean , just the right height to sit at a table , and very small and lightweight.I hope that this review helps someone to spend their money more wisely !	-1
I wish I 'd read the other reviews here before buying this chair . They are all accurate . We picked this chair because the features sounded nice and the price was good . Now we hate the chair and will be getting another one to replace it . My 15 month old learned quickly how to push the tray off the high chair , which makes mealtimes a nightmare . The chair is also very hard to clean . We have n't had problems with the seat reclining suddenly , just the tray flying off when you least expect it . I emailed Evenflo with my thoughts on the chair and got no response . Do n't buy this high chair ... go with something sturdier and easier to clean !	-1
I have owned this chair for 6 months and I do n't like it . Neither do my friends that use it , they all say that it is much harder to use than theirs.Likes:1 . The seat is height adjustable.2 . The seat can recline back.3 . The colors are cute.Dislikes:1 . This chair is huge.2 . It is a huge huge pain to fold up3 . The tray is the biggest pain when trying to put it on . You have to line it up just right which in my case has me bending down looking underneath to make sure it is aligned.4 . The wheels do not roll very well.5 . My sons hands always get pinched by the tray when I try to push it up close to him because it gets jammed.6 . The cloth gets stained to easy . There is no wiping off , you have to machine wash after any use that involves a spill.7 . The cloth on the seat does not fit properly and we ca n't get it to stay in place.8 . The clear tray is a joke and constantly pops out , we just gave up using it.9 . It is not stable at all.10 . To get the seat out of recline it takes sooo much work , and once you finaly get it , it pops out and the seat falls back down into recline.Cheap price ... cheap seat . Take my advice , spend alittle more and get something worth using .	-1
This has n't even survived well for one use . It was going flat within an hour or two . It 's thick like it 's quality , but I could n't believe how soon it was loosing air after some kids played around with it . I keep checking for holes , but no luck yet . If it 's in the seam , I 'll never find it and ca n't fix it of course	-1
Not an engaging bath toy , does n't make different sounds , and fogs up.Also seems flimsy so it is hard to store with other toys in a toy bucket situation .	-1
this is such a boring toy , its getting returned the parts dont stay on and it is not fun at all my friend has this toy , and i was going to buy t for a gift but im glad i seen hers its terrible and the kids dont even play with it .it just takes up space in ther room because it is huge . a big waste of energy and time lugging it from the store.a very boring toy in my opioion and my childs .	-1
We have many RH vehicles . My boys are all about vehicles , and things that `` go . '' This thing is just too darn big to be much fun ! They ca n't `` fly '' it ... and although it has many other features , they just are n't into that . They prefer their vehicles.After playing with it at a friend 's house , and not being all that impressed for more than a couple of minutes , we decided to buy the Rescue Heroes Dune Buggy and Robotz vehicle . This one just seems like too much `` hype '' for the money .	-1
My son is in second grade and does well in math . Sometimes he reverses his numbers and letters , but not a lot . Even when he wrote his number backwards you could still tell his answer was 5 . That is why it was heartbreaking to see a child confident in math suddenly calling himself stupid because he was n't progressing using FlashMaster . Unfortunately , it took a month of odd failures and tears before my son 's teacher realized he could n't use the Flashmaster because the digital display uses all straight lines . My son could n't consistently tell the difference between the 2 and 5 ! You ca n't tell by looking at my post because of the numbers are made of curved and straight lines . However , if you look at the picture amazon shows of the FlashMaster the 6 x 7 = ? everything is boxy and made of straight lines ( unlike the numberline at the bottom used for answering questions . ) My son has never had a problem using computer programs and nothing had held him back until now . It was the first time he told me he thought he was `` stupid '' and cried . It was the first time he had to deal with his classmates looking at him like there is something wrong with him . It was the first time he was unable to participate in a class activity.If my son was n't good at math the teacher might not have realized why he was failing half his FlashMaster challenges . If the teacher had n't taken the time to sit with my son and watch him work he probably never would have realized my son thought 2 + 2 = 10 because he thought it said 5 + 5 . It took about a month of frustration before anyone realized why my son was doing so poorly . He did n't consistently mix up the 2 & 5 . So if he had n't done so well before FlashMaster was introduced everyone would have thought he just did n't understand math instead of not being able to read the display.If anyone at FlashMaster reads this I hope you consider upgrading your display . It 's not nearly as expensive as it used to be and it matters . Some people may think it does n't matter , but it does .	-1
I bought this for my son who loves music . We had it for about 2 weeks before it started to malfunction . I did n't keep the receipt since I paid less than 20 bucks for this . He enjoyed it when it worked . Then it started to act funny . It would do what it was supposed to but an elephant noise would follow every thing he did ( whether he played a song or hit letter A ) . OK ... so we deal . Then it started to make click noises . Then the music set to knob # 1 would n't work , just click-click-click . OK , so I figure maybe it needs batteries . That did n't help . Then , I figure the toy was a bust so I might as well take it apart and try to fix it . I messed around and got it working . It still make elephant noise but all 4 areas worked ... . For about 2 days ! Then it was messed up again and worse than before . Now all 4 knobs just click ! The kid had it for less than a month and its fully dysfunctional ! OK , that being said , the music was nice . It was cute and The lights worked well . Taught numbers and letters and colors and animals and sounds . I did not like that if it got all messed up dirty-wise , you could take off the cover but you could n't wash the cover because it had plastic all over it ( just not mechanical plastic ) and you ca n't put it in the washer . So that kind of stunk but oh well ... It just was WAY beyond disappointment for me.I hope this helps ... it was fun but not durable in the least . Just a small warning from my experience .	-1
The item says it is `` Word Whammer '' but the picture shows the same `` FridgeWords '' as the other - a stupid newly incompatible gimmick to greedily keep people from using their old letters in combinations or if ( oh , how impossible ! ) a toddler lost a single letter from the old set . This is an vicious marketing trick by a company that does n't care about customers at all . Ca n't Amazon at least get it straight and let us know if this is the old or the new version . My review is for Amazon 's irresponsible labeling , not for the product , which I do n't know if I should buy . I would buy it if I knew it was the compatible WordWhammer . But like everyone else , I would n't buy it with the new incompatibility unless I was unethically tricked into it , as so many people have been .	-1
This would be a great toy if only it worked properly . It is useless because it reads the letters wrong and the sound quality is poor .	-1
There are three modes . My son 's favorite is word hunt , where it asks him to find the letters to spell a word . He is three years old and does not know how to spell yet , but can usually find the letters it asks for to spell the word.The good : -The magnets are strong and stick to the fridge well.- My son loves the design and likes to & # 34 ; fly & # 34 ; it around the house.- It seems to know most , if not all , valid three letter words that are child-appropriate . At least , I have n't found one it does n't know yet.The bad : - Sometimes , the sound gets stuck and we have to turn it off and back on ( sometimes several times in a row ) to get it to work properly again.- It sings the same song EVERY time a word is spelled . I do n't think it bothers my toddler , but it 's really annoying.The terrible : - Sometimes , when a letter is already loaded into the first slot and a second letter is placed into the second slot , it misidentifies the second letter . For example , it thinks & # 34 ; t & # 34 ; is & # 34 ; f. & # 34 ; That really bothers me and I was hoping it was just a fluke that other reviewers experienced , but mine does the same . This greatly takes away from the educational value of the toy.It earns a second star because of my son 's love of word hunt mode and it 's secondary use as a toy plane , but I was pretty close to giving it one star because it just does n't work the way I think it should .	-1
I wish I paid more attention to these reviews about the letters functioning incorrectly . I thought I 'd take my chances and I got what I paid for . It worked correctly for about a month . It would have been a great educational toy if it worked well . I do n't want my children thinking an F is a G and Q is an E. There are less letter choices with this toy , but my kids have gotten more accurate play out of it : Melissa & Doug See & Spell puzzle . I 'm really disappointed in leap frog.Luckily , our fridge phonics still works correctly , but I 'm wondering how long I have until that toy starts giving incorrect letters .	-1
Lots of fun , until you run into a bug - wo n't read the word and makes a repetitive skipping noise . I called Leapfrog , but they no longer make the product and were no help . They also did not offer to replace the product with a similar item . Nor did they have any suggestions on a possible fix . Guess that 's why they stopped making this .	-1
I was secretly hoping that this would entertain and educate my 4yo child without taking up my time . You definitely need to play this machine with your child if you want your child to learn . Unfortunately , the voice is very unclear . `` f '' sounds like `` s '' . `` hen '' sounds like `` fen '' . Heck , even I have to guess what word/letter the machine is trying to spell or say.Also , my daughter gets disappointed when she wants to spell words longer than 3 letters and ca n't . Ca n't even spell `` zoo '' because there 's only one `` O '' .The only good news is that my daughter is paying more attention to spelling and to word/letter sounds than usual . Otherwise , this toy would only get one star from me .	-1
My friend invited me over when he picked up this Days of Wonder board game . He is a big-time & # 34 ; euro & # 34 ; gamer and needed someone who was interested in war to come over and help him learn and play this new game ( we played several games of Mem . 44 that Sunday morning and below is my review ) .First of all ; the art , color palate and game pieces are all first rate . This is no surprise , because Days of Wonder always makes quality FAMILY games . They really do a great job in that department . Typically I do n't care for little cardboard & # 34 ; chits & # 34 ; that represent units in most wargames and Mem . 44 has great miniatures that represent those battlefield units . I love this part of the game and a definite draw to play Mem . 44.The rulebook is well written and everything was very clear ( with nice illustrations to help visualize correct rules in practice ) . How many times have you read a rule book and been frustrated ? ( probably more times than you can count because it 's hard to make a good one ) .The box is a great square size and everything fits well . The cardboard is nice and thick and will hold up over time . I ca n't tell you how many times , I have seen bad boxes for board games ! This one is great ! Now the rules and & # 34 ; mechanics & # 34 ; of Mem'44 is odd ( to say the least ) . It is a card based system that gives you limited actions . If you did n't draw a & # 34 ; move left & # 34 ; card , then ... . you ca n't move in that direction . If you did n't draw air support or artillery , then again ... no fire support . So often I needed to counter my opponent with moving units to support & # 34 ; X & # 34 ; or & # 34 ; Y & # 34 ; , but I did n't have the cards to support it . That would be like playing chess and not being able to do it , because you did n't have the cards or & # 34 ; orders & # 34 ; to do it . It 's so frustrating that I was screaming inside my head & # 34 ; Please give me the card to do & # 34 ; X & # 34 ; ! & # 34 ; ( when I drew up ) . Nothing felt right ... . to the fire of my units to having no morale . I really do n't understand why so many people love this Mem . 44 card based system for a wargame , there are so many better rules and systems out there ! I have played many historical miniature games from the Napoleonic period and others ... and I have played many wargames on the PC , and I have never had my hands tied so much in a game ! How can you play a military commander or General and not be able to control your units ? I just do n't get it . Maybe this game is supposing your a Lieutenant taking orders from a General ( e.g . action cards ) where you have so little control ? Because that is the only explanation I can hypothesize.HOWEVER , after all those negative words ... . this is a nice little light wargame for children or people who do n't know anything about history . It has great text in the rule book to enlighten the non-war ( non-historical ) public , and that is great . It can be an entry into the genre of wargames too , but honestly this game is NOT for me . If you want to have an enjoyable historic , armchair-general experience , try another game.So to end , this game is well produced , beautiful , and for the price it 's a fairly good value . Just know , it 's like playing chess when you were a teenager and your dad sitting behind you ... telling you ... you can only move knight piece to the left ... or the castle piece to & # 34 ; X & # 34 ; location ... and that 's it ! Memoir 44 simply is one extremely frustrating experience after another.Good luck and game on ! R.M.H .	-1
My grandson got this for Christmas and it does not seem to work very well . You load the darts and they only shoot out some of the time which can be frustrating .	-1
My dad originally got this gun for himself . First battle , it worked fine . Next time he could n't get it to shoot . I eventually got it to work so he gave it to me . Then it started jamming terribly and the pump stopped working . My brother tried to fix it but the piece of junk just got worse.Good points : -rate of fire : this gun shoots fast for a little gun , but it ca n't aim well you pump and shoot fastBad points : -capacity : it holds six darts . Pathetic if you ask me . It is harder to reload that gun than a CS clip.-range : this gun shoots ok for range but not my first choice in a war.-jams : this gun jams . Simple as that . The darts stick out and then the gun wo n't work.-accuracy : How do they expect you to aim this thing as you shoot it fast ? ? ? ? ? ? Overall , I think this gun is pathetic and is the last gun of that kind of Nerf I 'm buying . Worst ever.Plain and simple .	-1
Excellent concept , excellent graphics & quality , awful game . Why sit around playing a game that chooses a winner completely at random ? Save yourself the time : deal out the carrot cards then pick one from the small carrot card deck and your done . You 've now determined the winner of the game , without actually having to play it . I would have given 1/2 a star rating but the quality of the cards is excellent . Which is the only good thing I can say about the game . The cards are funny but even this losses its appeal after playing a couple of times . I bought this as a family Christmas present and was VERY disappointed . I even went as far as drawing up new rules for determining a winner ; but while eliminating the luck factor , it just emphasized the fact that this is a poorly developed game in a fancy package . There is potential for a better game with the same concept but Playroom needs to kill this version of the game and start over ; maybe a combination of board & card game .	-1
We bought this , thinking it would be a quirky/cool card game to play . But because of the terrible , terrible instructions , we never got around to actually playing it . The instructions are poorly written , and make no sense . We literally could NOT get a game started - I forget exactly why - all I know is the instructions made no sense . I was mad too , because I bought an expansion pack as well . I ended up just throwing it out . Waste of money . Do n't get it !	-1
Unlike the pictures , Annie and Clarabelle 's facial expression is exactly the same . I got this set in Dec. 2012 . I did n't think it was a big deal last year , because our son was going on 2 was only obsessed with Thomas and Percy at the time ... and I figured he would n't even notice.But here we are over half a year later and now he knows EVERY character by name . He likes to line up all the trains and reenact the real Thomas show and homemade youtube videos . And these girls always get left out ... . or he just grabs one and calls it `` annieclare '' . So yeah , it 's kinda of a pointless set to buy for older kids who are really into the characters themselves.Follow up : I painted Annie 's gray top with a clear nail polish that had silver glitter in it and gave her a little lipstick and eyeshadow ( also using nail polish applied with a toothpick ) . He totally knows the difference now .	-1
We bought this for our three year old for Christmas . He loves to sing and dance . The product LOOKS durable and very nice . However , it never played a CD . It would n't spin . We tried several things but gave up . Amazon returned the item through UPS with no problem . We werent able to do an exchange though since it was through a third party seller .	-1
This item was a gift for my 4 year old daughter , she loved it for the few weeks that it actually worked . It was one of her `` supervision '' toys so it was only brought down of the toy shelves when I could keep an eye on her . Unfortunately , it stopped being able to `` read '' CD 's in just 3 weeks . The microphones still work but it was very disappointing not being able to play CD's.Also this toy eats batteries up ! We have a stash of cost co batteries and changed them twice in three weeks.Buy an actual CD player .	-1
Just 40 pieces are too less to create bigger and better formations . Price is on the higher side . Many other options to keep little ones busy are available for this price .	-1
My 2 year old got this for her birthday from her aunt and uncle and it does not stay together at all . The ferris wheel wo n't even hold the combined weight of the 3 ponies included in the pack . Plus one of the included ponies was posed the opposite way than the other 2 so she was very hard to use with this toy . My daughter has more fun taking this toy apart than playing with it . With no noises or lights or anything the toy gets boring really quick ( if you can get it to stay together that is ) .	-1
My oldest daughter saved her allowance for this , and I feel like Hasbro owes her a refund . First , there are only two activites to this set , the ferris wheel and the `` roller coaster '' . The ferris wheel will fall apart if the child is n't careful , although unlike other reviewers ours will hold three ponies . The track for the coaster comes apart at the drop of a hat , and forget about trying to move this thing . As much of a cash cow as the whole MLP line is , you 'd think Hasbro would put a little more money into production , even if it raised the cost of the finished product . I would NOT recommend spending your money on this one .	-1
Looks pretty darn cute - but just a piece of junk . The track does not stay together at all - even when pieces are properly assembled and snapped together . My kids gave up on it after a day , lost interest in it not staying together . Plus , I think they found it boring . Okay , push the car down the roller coaster . Yeah , then what ? The ferris wheel they had zilch interest in also . My pony loving girls seem to have found this to be boring . My son is the only one who has played with it - just the ponies and the car to push along on the carpet . that 's it.I picked this up on clearance for less than $ 5 - and really , that 's about how much it 's worth in my opinion.We have the castle , and while that fall apart , too , the kids still like that - how the castle comes apart does n't ruin their play with it - but this , what fun is a roller coaster when the track does n't stay together ? And is n't something my girls can put back together themselves.I would n't recommend buying this unless you find it super marked down on clearance , and only then if your child is really into ponies .	-1
My daughter loves My Little Pony , but I 'm very disappointed with this set . Every time she plays with it , the tracks come apart . Also , even when I securely 'snapped ' the ferris wheel portion together , it just wo n't stay attached , it 's always falling apart . The butterfly 'wings ' that you use to hook the ponies to the ferris wheel are constantly falling off also.It 's very frustrating for my daughter , she loves it when it stays in one piece . Unfortunently it falls apart so often , that it 's just not worth the hassle to constantly be putting back together.A good idea , Hasbro just needs better quality control .	-1
My Granddaughter is so in love with my Little Pony things now . We have most of them and most accessories but this is definetly top heavy . This is the 1st item I 've been very disappointed with . I 'd read that the Ferris Wheel ca n't hold 3 poinies but it ca n't even hold 2 . The set-up keeps coming apart . What a Disappointment ! So much of the other things that are Pony related are vey cute .	-1
Because this has a completely open top , my daughter only wants to put the shapes in there instead of the right holes . I also do n't like that there are only 4 shapes when you can get sorters with a lot more . The ones with more shapes are obviously more educational . I wo n't deny that this toy is cute , but it plays unnecessary music . I would honestly just buy a different sorter .	-1
I got this for our daughter when she was six months old . I gave her a few toys and she seemed more interested in this one at the store so I bought this one . She is now one year and this toy has gotten little play . She had chewed on the hammer but never played with the toy by herself . The only time it is used is when I or her dad are playing with it while she watches . The upside is that the sounds and songs it plays are fun and bright . I would not recommend this toy .	-1
In one word BORING . My son is 16 months old and shows not the least bit of interest in this toy and I can see why . When I clean out his toy chest this one will be the first to go . My son played with it a handful of times and he was not at all entertained by it . Skip this one there is better out there .	-1
This toy used to engage my baby about a 15 minutes or so..He played with it in his early phase of 1st year ( around his 6th month-8thmonth ) ..and babies are very intelligent in understanding thefirst in first out surprise of this gumball..This product ENHANCES MEMORY part of the kids ! The make is excellent . Colors are bright .	-1
My daughter is now 10 months old . I gave her this toy at 8 months . She used it 2-3 times and since could care less about it . I think she may be too young for it . She tries to put the balls into the bottom even though I keep showing her how to use it . As far as educational ... . Cause and effect is where I would say the education comes in , then there is colors but that 's about it . As far as durable..its burable but I truly wish it did n't tip so easily . Cute toy over all .	-1
I ordered this for my nephew , who only ever wants gift cards for any birthday or Christmas . I thought it would be fun to make him work for it ! The box opening was too small for the card I bought ( a XBox live gift card ) . I ended up cutting the gift card , so I hope that didnt mess it up ! Also , it door barely closed , even with the card cut way down . I found it pretty cheap . I have my doubts that it will even actually work , am looking forward to seeing if my nephew can actually do it . If not , I guess he could take a saw to the plastic ... I hope it doesnt come to that , but I have my doubts of its functionality .	-1
Not only are all these cube mazes the same , I bought two from each company , thinking they would be different . The sellers must buy them from the same supplier . One of them had a blocked passage that the ball needed to use to complete the maze .	-1
I ca n't really provide much info on the puzzle itself because mine was broken in transit , but then that speaks to the quality of the product ... Looking at it , the difficulty might have been ok , but I 'm not sure the latch would function properly every time and it looks like it could be opened with a well-placed bump . Maybe if it is n't broken , it would be a fun little gift , but damage durring transit seems to be common , so it 's a gamble.I 'd steer clear . There are better puzzle box gifts available .	-1
The instructions are very vague . They did not explain how to lock the door . I was able to lock the door upon reviewing a YouTube video . However , the door is easily forced to open to access gift .	-1
This is made out of very cheap plastic . It broke after the first use . Had it only cost me $ 1 I would have been ok with it .	-1
I was a little disappointed with this ball and so was my daughter . First , the smell when we blew it up was awful . We had to let it sit outside for several days as the chemical smell was just too strong . Also , it 's kind of a funky size . Not exactly too small but not a good fit either - and my daughter is small . The quality of the ball is good though and it seems like it will last for a long time , even though she does n't use it .	-1
looks like it would be a fun toy but1 smaller than expected2 it was full of this slime and sticky goowas not happy at allhope my neice likes it or i am returning	-1
Do not buy this item . We had it one day and inflated it to the exact directions and it literally lasted less the one hour . Mind you my daughter weighs in at 28lbs . And boom it burst and on the floor she went . Junk	-1
Bought this for my daughter and I have seen balloons bigger than this thing . It 's so small any kid small enough to actually bounce on it probably is n't old enough to bounce in the first place . It 's already been tossed .	-1
OK so I ordered this for my four year old despite the negative reviews of it being so small . It is ridiculously small . It 's probably the same size of a beach ball that you would purchase at your local dollar store . My daughter kept saying , I keep falling off ! She was not happy . However , it 's a perfect size for my 20 month old . I would n't purchase this for any child over the age of 2 . I ordered this one and the Sesame Street one . The Sesame Street one is a bit bigger and my four year old enjoys it a lot more . It 's too big for my 20 month old . So they just swapped . Not worth the money or hassle to blow up . I wish I applied my $ 30 ( for both plus shipping and handling ) elsewhere .	-1
Got this for my 2 year old daughter who loves Disney Princesses as an activity for her to do in the yard . The ball is easy to inflate and I like the handle to carry it around as well . She actually carries it around like a purse ! The ball itself is made of a thick material and seems durable.However , I 'm very disappointed that when it arrived , there was an oily substance on it and after a while the graphics of the princesses rub off ! Also , it loses air quickly and you have to keep pumping it up . But most of all , I 'm very unhappy that it 's so small even for a 2 year old , so I ca n't see how an older child would be able to sit on it.Save your money and find one that is larger and better quality !	-1
This is a fun toy . The way the balloons fly around is fun to watch and the sound they make is just hilarious , especially for young kids . BUT the pump broke within the first 10 fills . We superglued it back together and it lasted another 5 fills or so . Also , maybe it 's just us or just the pump we received as no one else has mentioned it , but we found the pump required ALOT of strength to fill the balloons . So much so that it was much easier to fill them with our mouths . No way our daughter could do it on her own.Like others , we had issues with some of the balloons : several had holes and could never be filled , others tore easily on their first flight around the room . But there were many good balloons in the bunch too.If the pump were easier to use and did n't break so readily , this could easily be played with for hours at a time . As it stands , we 're tired after 10 minutes or so . I ca n't give it more than 2 stars .	-1
This appears to be a really fun outdoor toy , and it does have a lot of play value . However , it is not overly durable if you use it as an outdoor toy . The stickers that come with the playhouse quickly peeled off within a few months of play . This was disappointing , because they really added to the decor of the playhouse . The plastic shutters ended up cracking and one shutter fell off ... plus the color of the shutters turned very yellow and foggy over time . The basketball netting also did not last and frayed very quickly . My children ( 3 & 5 ) loved the store side of the house , and would hand out food to mom and dad all day long . They also enjoyed using the gasoline pump to fuel their bicycles and john deere tractors . The creativity of the toy is fun , but I would recommend keeping this indoors to maintain the appearance of the playhouse . I would also forego using the stickers if you are going to put the playhouse outside .	-1
Ok , I first bought this `` town '' playhouse . I was not happy with what I recieved for the amount of money I spent . There are no tables ! ONLY a corner shelf type table ( worthless ) . For the money there are no sounds , the inside is non-colorful , pointless , it is very dark inside , no chairs came with it , and no shelves . I was not happy ! SO I exchanged this for the `` Naturally Playful Cottage '' . ON the website there is only a 30.00 dollar differance , in the store it cost 349.99 . I did n't care . If I 'm going to spend that much money I 'm going to get something I want.The Naturally Playful Cottage is so much better ! You get two tables ! ! ! 1 table outside with 2 bench seats , and the inside table you can put two folding chairs in it . My son puts his microwave on the inside table , and sits on the oustide table , gives him more room.. This playhouse has lots of shelves ! ! ! The fireplace has 1 long shelf ... The other house did n't have any ! This playhouse has a sink , stove , sounding doorbell that does n't take batteries and a phone with sounds ! ! ! the roof is made to be taller , that lets air and light into it , much better ! This is much cuter overall , and the inside is like 5 star comparied to the `` town '' playhouse , which has nothing ... I get in here and play with my son , plenty of room ! ! ! I 'm not lying , you must buy this Naturally Playful Cottage , I hope this was helpful , to save other parents from making the mistake I made and buying , setting up and breaking down and returning/ exchanging for something worth the money ! ! !	-1
I agree with all who complaint about the assembly . It is one of the worst product to assemble . Little tikes should add a metal rod and some other type to lock the bolt.One other problem is that it throws off the the baby if the clothing is slippery.And also , is very narrow and does not provide enough spae for the child to position properly before sliding down .	-1
well look at this ! ! I heard that they are coming out with a TATOO PARLOR ... FOR BABYZ ! ! ! ! With skulls and flaming hearts and everything ! ! ! And have you looked at the outfits lately ? ? ? `` Babyz Nite Out '' looked like something a hooker would wear ! ! ! And these are REAL quotes from the commercials : '' Trouble never looked so cute ! `` `` Babies with BLING ! `` See what I mean ?	-1
This set of stacking rings are well made , but i have two problems with it:1 > they are WAY too small for my 1 year old son . I ca n't imagine they are fun for 2 year olds ... all he wants to do is to throw them down the steps . They rings & the poles are simply too small to grab his attention.I got another big plastic sets and he like that so much more.2 > The top round-shaped ball does not screw in , so it 's impossible to keep the set together when you have a very active toddler .	-1
As a mom of 2 little girls I am a big fan of barbie 's new princess line . The last one Princess Anneliese and Erika were amazing . I bought both dolls , plus the castle for my girls . I was very sad to see Princess Anneliese and Erika sold out of stock and production only to be replaced by fairytopia dolls . These fairy dolls promote immodesty . The producers of immodest clothing are targetting younger and younger ages these days . I would never buy this doll because I do n't want to promote a dress that has no straps or sleeves , is low cut , and extremely short . Walking through Target my 4 year old told me that she wanted to dress up like Elina . Instead I would prefer to buy her an Erika dress since my other daughter has an Anneliese dress . However , Erika dresses are not available anymore.I saw this movie on Nickelodeon and one thing that I like about the movie is that Elina is different from the other fairies and in the end her alone standing up made a difference in whether or not fairytopia was taken over . Well , we need to stand up for those things that are good and not let the media dictate how we should dres scantilly , etc . Women should dress to be respected . I have found that when we dress with class there is more respect for ourselves and woman is not seen as someone to be belittled . I think Mattel should keep a positive reputation . We are targetting young innocent little girls here .	-1
The only time this thing ever bucked was when my kid forced it too . No matter what the level setting 1-3 ( 3 being the hardest ) it was beaten EVERY TIME.Also there were times when it was very difficult to get the saddle to stay on . Save your money and avoid . I am not sure how Hasbro can sell such a piece of junk .	-1
We got this game for Christmas and thought that it would bring alot of fun and challenge . There is definitely no challenge to it . I agree with some of the other reviewers in that the horse never bucks regardless of level . Unless you press it as hard as you can to make it buck . Too easy to put stuff on and no fun in the end .	-1
Picked this up after the enticing commercials my 3.5 yr old saw ... and returned it the day after . Definitely not worth the price ( ... ) ! Pieces kept falling off , we could n't get the saddle to stay on and most of the prongs were not long enough to hold any of the pieces . Other times we could load the horse up and it would n't buck at all ! Save your money for something other than this plastic gem .	-1
I got this doll and i was soo excited . But then the ends of her hair started to frizz up and she was n't that fun anymore , because her hair was all over the place ! ! I had to cut almost all of it off , too , and now she 's ruined ! ! ! Ive heard really good things about Treasures Roxxi , so i would recomend her over Cloe .	-1
Straight out of the box the drawer would not open -- when you press the 'Open ' button it makes a 'Cha-Ching ' noise as described in the instructions but the drawer would not open -- appeared to be stuck slightly open but no amount of jiggling , pushing , etc would get the drawer to respond to the button . The scanner also responded indiscriminately to any of the bar codes -- not bringing up the specific price based on the label that was scanned but bringing up one of the prices randomly -- not sure this matters but certainly is not how it is supposed to work . Returned immediately .	-1
Drawer does not open ... .at.all ! ! The lever that releases it inside does not lift high enough . I did not try to return it because my kids had already torn into it , excited to play and the rcpt and box were thrown out but what a joke ! I saw in the reviews that this has been an ongoing problem with this toy . I bought it thinking the money was causing those drawers to stick but now I see this is just very poorly made . The company should not continue to sell something that clearly does n't work . Too bad because I love the idea and all the other features . If it were not for the malfunctioning drawer it would get a 5 star rating .	-1
Because of the openings in the balls where you feel the textured patches , these do not roll very well and do n't even work with some of the playsets . I love other Roll-A-Rrounds though and would give all other sets of them 5 stars .	-1
i bought these for my son when he was about a year and he never cared for them . when they came out of the package they were new but he only played with them for about a minute . dont know if this was another product i bought when he was too old for them but they werent anything he got excited about nor did they entertain him like the other reviews said .	-1
My daughter begged for this forever and finally I got it for her . It 's basically useless . Too small for most furniture ( IF YOU CAN EVEN FIND ANY ) and the shape makes it almost impossible to even fit what small amount came with it in it to play . VERY disappointing .	-1
This toy is SUCH a disappointment & waste of money . The accessories ( what there are of them ) do not even fit in the house , and the window boxes , etc . do not stay put . [ ... ]	-1
If you 've ever seen the film `` Name of the Rose '' , then you 'll have a good idea of the theme of this game.I 've always loved the movie with Christian Slater and Sean Connery and it 's moody historical story that made you feel like you were in medieval Europe . Unlike the movie , this game fails in so many ways . But before I get ahead of myself , let me give you reasons why ; Components : The figurines looked like mini monk statues and really nice sculptures . The board was a overhead illustration of a medieval building with rooms and thematic Latin words . However every now and then , we would draw from a deck of room cards that were black and white ( and I thought to myself , `` why are they not in color ? Seems like a dumb way to save money '' ) . The box was nice and sturdy and the rules did not seem very complete , and we were house ruling in some things to make it complete.Art/Design : The art is almost comic book looking and seems odd . I have never understood why Clue was so `` cute-sy '' and comic-like if the subject was murder ( and the same applies here ) . Maybe the producer and designer wanted to `` keep-it-light '' and keep it from being too grim ? Because murder and a criminal monk is n't a laughing matter . The colors are somewhat muted and the box top 's art does not match the inside 's almost water color style as well.Game play/Game Mechanics : Every player on his/her turn gets two/three action points . Most people would move two spaces and then ask questions of another investigator/player . Being in any room for the most part , gained no real advantage . At one point all the players stayed in the center room and just asked questions of each other . I took notes in the game we played , but it just seemed to confuse me because at the end of the 4th round , we went to `` mass '' and passed the 4 monk cards to the right . This practically killed my notes . What is odd about this game is , I at no time felt `` immersed '' within the theme . Also , at no time did we the investigators learn who was killed or what crime was committed . Furthermore , we at no time learned motives or other crime investigatory techniques or ways to narrow the search . All we could do is ask weather the guilty monk had a beard , hood or was skinny , etc etc . This series of elimination was downright annoying , and we just started guessing to get the game over with . Basically when you hurry to end a game ( just to get it over with ) this is a sign of a bad game in my opinion . The room cards that gave you special functions or special powers , gained you practically nothing as well.End Thoughts : I know your going to think I am negative and a `` hater '' , but this game really lacks in so many ways . I wanted to love this game since `` The Name of the Rose '' is such an awesome theme and movie . I believe if this game 's mechanics and art was altered significantly you 'd have an great game . Not learning of who the victim was is like having no body to a murder . In real life , the investigators would have `` nothing '' and the case would get dropped . Thus I intend to drop this game from my collection for I too had no `` body of evidence '' .	-1
I got this for my boys , 1 and 3 at the time , and they loved it , unfortunately it did n't last long . It got a leak within a day of having it . Since then we blow it up occasionally and they still really enjoy it . I may get just a plain bag with no `` appendages '' , like hair , arms , or noses . Less seams to pop open , because that 's where the holes tend to appear .	-1
Thought this would be cute for my kids ... but it started leaking air right away . We pump it up but then a few hours later it 's falling over . Kids really like it , but it does n't seem that durable !	-1
This item came with a hole in it right out of the box . Grownups and children were disappointed . However , the company was good about return and refund , and I paid no return shipping . My grown children had Bozo when they were kids and we were hoping to enjoy this again with the grandchildren , but never got to even blow him up . I hope they can fix the manufacturing problem as this is a fun toy , we will try purchasing again if quality improves .	-1
Very disappointed in this . It looked so cute on line , but it 's not in person . My daughter hasn'y even given it a second look since she opened it Christmas morning & I do n't blame her . It 's dull & not much to it	-1
I 'm finding it rather complicated to rate this toy appropriately and want to emphasize up front that my review is somewhat lengthy , but ask everyone to please read it , as it does contain what I consider important info on this product ... ... ... ... ... .OK , first off , upon receiving this item I was pretty surprised at how it was packaged . The cloth animals that go in each block/cylinder were attached inside each with string and each animal was strung together . I immediately cut them loose and pulled the strings out of each animal . However , I have 4 children and my mother owned a daycare when I was growing up , so I have been purchasing children 's toys for many years now and have plenty of child safety experience in general . Without any instructions stating that the strings were to be removed , I am none the eager to imagine what could happen if a younger , more inexperienced parent , or perhaps just a parent having a & # 34 ; Duh ? ! & # 34 ; day or possibly in a rush , which are both scenarios that happen to the best of us , were to leave the strings , thinking maybe they are supposed to stay attached , as some toys are made this way . These were literally strings , like thick cross stitching thread , strings . So , I was n't too impressed with the packaging and felt if they were packaged this way then there should have been a sticker attached or an instruction pamphlet , something cautioning the removal of these strings prior to play . That said , I tend to be somewhat paranoid about children 's safety issues and its not as though its the worst safety hazard I 've ever seen , so moving on.The next thing that I noted was the size of some of the animals . If they were plastic , rubber or maybe even a hard foam , then they would be fine . However , they are cloth with cotton stuffing or batting fill . That being the case , they are squishy and can be mushed flat and compacted in a tight little ball very easily . The chicken , lambs and even the pigs are too small in my opinion and with a baby or young toddler chewing and slobbering on these , I feel they could become lodged in the throat rather easily and would be hard to expel because of the material.I have also found several loose threads hanging around the edges of both the cylinders and animals I had to cut and pull off.The last issue I have with this set is the cylinder construction . The cylinders are cloth covering cardboard , this is how they maintain their shape . I realize many children/baby toys are made with cardboard and have no problem with that . My complaint however is the quality of the cardboard used . It is very thin and makes durability an issue.I am actually very shocked by the issues I have found with this set , as Manhattan toys has always been one of my faves . We own MANY toys by Manhattan , Baby Stella and tons of her accessories , whoozit toys , and many more . I have always been very pleased with all Manhattan purchases and consider them one of the best sources of fun , educational , safe toys at a reasonable price.Negatives aside , my baby girl does truly love this toy set . She has had this for a few months now and plays with it alot . This is an accomplishment , as we own 2 homes and she has a massive assortment of toys at both places , I do not even attempt to make excuses , she is flat out spoiled rotten . This combined with the fact that she is in the 1 and 1/2 age yrs bracket , makes it difficult for any one toy to keep her attention longer then 5 min.I 'm not sure whether it is the bright colors , the put in take out factor , the cows ( I gave her the cows and cylinders and put the rest away ) , the flaps she can close , or what , but for whatever reason , she adores this toy set . She will grab it over tons of other toys available and sit and put the cows in all 3 cylinders and take them back out for long periods of time . When she tires of it and moves on to play with other things she always returns to pick it up again very shortly.For us , this toy is still an excellent value and was money well spent , as my daughter loves it . However , others may find that having to remove much of the set for safety purposes makes this set a less then stellar purchase.. You are essentially paying $ 25- $ 30 for 3 cardboard cylinders and 4 stuffed cows.I realize my review is rather lengthy and thank those of you whom took the time to read it . I wanted to make sure that I mentioned the safety issues I found with this product , as this is the most important factor in choosing children 's toys . I feel strongly that the construction quality of toys has rapidly declined with companies and parents alike focusing so much recently on the toxicity of paints , chemicals and plastics . Not to say that those things may not hold merit , but our children have been using bottles and other plastic items made with BPA for years and have been chewing on painted toys for even longer with no ill results.I am personally much more concerned that my child not have a toy constructed of materials causing choking and injury hazards that I KNOW CAN happen now , rather then focusing on something that MAY pose risk later.Based on my experience , I could not really recommend this toy for others . While it worked out well for us and was worth the effort taken to make necessary adjustments , I feel it may not be a good purchase for others and may be dangerous in some circumstances.I give this product stars for design concept , educational value and general play-ability , but had to remove stars for the negative issues . If this product were packaged and constructed differently with larger animals , it would definitely be a 5 star product.Please take these points into consideration before purchasing this for a baby or younger toddler . Thank you ! !	-1
My daughter does not play with this toy at all . She is 16 months old . Perhaps it will be more fun when she is older.For now , this purchase was a bust .	-1
I can not comprehend what others found so great about this item , especially for younger children . The eggs do not stay in tact . In other words , the egg halves DO NOT stick together . It is cheaply made and I have to say , I was not thrilled with this item one bit .	-1
I bought this for my 11mo old daughter . The `` squeak '' from the eggs is not what I imagined . There is no real squeaker , just a rushing of air if you forcefully push on the head inside the egg ( if you do n't press fast enough you end up with basically just a clicking sound ) . Also , the box is a little hard to open , and my daughter gets very frustrated when she tries ( even I find it a little awkward to open , it 's not just the baby ) . Overall I say this toy is `` ok '' at best .	-1
I got this as a gift for a toddler and did not give it . It is a very cheap , cheesy , what would you call it - a game ? Save your money .	-1
I purchased this for my grankids . I was disappointed with the product itself . However , the kids seem to enjoy it .	-1
In my household with 3 young children , and 2 of them young enough to `` appreciate '' this toy ... all it is used for is to scatter about and add to the mess . I have never seen my children use this toy in the way it 's intended , as something of a shape sorter . It is very complicated for a child to use it this was as the shape at the bottom of the egg is inconspicuous and where it should be placed takes some amount of examination not likely to be done by a small child . When they have tried to put the eggs back into the egg carton , they generally just see them as not fitting right , so the result is the eggs are never in their container and generally a favorite toy to scatter about the floor . I also found that the container , when closed , is really hard to open and I have had to pry it open for them every time it 's been closed . What a disappointment for a highly rated toy .	-1
I do not like this game , and my daughter does n't either . There are way too many similar pictures in the set of cards . We only play with half of them anyway , but they are still very similar . Also there is nothing on the back of the tiles to help you lay them out all the same way . Some of them are always upside down or sideways . We like Dr. Seuss matching MUCH better . The pictures are all different , there is a logo on the back of each tile so that you can lay them out properly , and it 's overall more fun . My daughter picks Dr. Seuss matching over the Disney game every time .	-1
I bought this doll MONTHS ago and when i took her out of the box i loved her ... at first , that is ... .After about 2 days , her hair became SUCH a mess , it was extremly hard to brush . For $ 30 ( In Canada ) i would have expected much more acessories and WAY better quality . I have to admit , though , this doll is pretty . The theme is great , whoever came up with it , bravo ! But the quality is outragously poor , at least for the Bratz . The belt for the doll 's pants broke , and i ca n't even have a refund ! I want a refund ! This is one of the WORST Bratz purcheses i have EVER made ! I am highly disapointed in this doll . Anyone who thinks the quality of this doll is good must not be thinking ! You could buy TWO sportz dolls for the price of this ( at least in Canada ! ! ! )	-1
While still in the box , i thought this doll was beautiful . But when i took her out of the box , i was extremly disapointed . The hair , in about a weekend , became matted and ugly . The red and black mixed together , which i HATED . And for the price ( $ 30 Canadian ) I would have expected MANY more accessories , and better quality . I definetly do n't recomend this doll , unless you are planning on leaving it IN the box . It will just be a HUGE disapointment , trust me . Do n't waste your money .	-1
I love Bratz to death , so i had to get it . When i took it out of the box , the cheap acessories fell apart , the arm got loose , and the hair mixed together ; making it all tangled up . All i can say , is please do n't waste your money on this doll . This is the absolute worst Bratz doll i have ever recived , ever . The feet also fall of easily , and the legs are bent in a weird way . I would n't recomend this to you , unless you just want to waste your money in exchange for a terrible doll .	-1
These planes are exactly how I remember them to be . I had some of these back in the 1950s , and they are no better than they were then . I 'm not blaming the manufacturer or the seller , they are just not very strong . If you are n't very careful , you will ruin them when trying to assemble them . Of course , I 'm all thumbs , and not very patient when it comes to things like these . Oh well , at least I could relive a piece of my childhood .	-1
Read a lot of reviews and decided to go for it.Did n't fly any better than the foam ones we have.Wind or no wind . Maybe we do n't have the knack for hand gliding .	-1
Had a really hard time dealing with Xump and Fascinations . Xump 's website does n't tell you where to get the ants , I assume there is some certificate in the box . Then you get the box and there 's no certificate . Xump does n't have anyone in their office . Fascinations answered but I think I reached the janitor because he did n't know what the heck I was talking about so I hung up . When I FINALLY got the stupid ants they were all dead except like 4 of them and they ca n't breed so i wasted a crap-load of money on a product neither the maker nor supplier would help me with . DON '' T BUY IT !	-1
The ant farm looked fun and was reasonable priced at $ 19.99 , but when I went to order ants online as stated in the instruction book , shipping was $ 10.38 ( for the only shipping option ) and the ants were $ 4.95 . So , we would be paying over $ 35 for this smaller than expected ant farm . I am going to try to scoop up some ants outside to give it a try , but there is no way I am paying an additional $ 15 for a handful of ants- that is ridiculous ! Before you order this , read the dimensions and measure it out to see- it is not as big as you might expect .	-1
This was cool looking but the ants ate through the white seal surrounding the top . It took them a few weeks but finally I had to have my husband get rid of this because they were pushing up the top and getting out . I could n't believe it ! I was cool to look as while it lasted though .	-1
If this is & # 34 ; high quality acrylic paint & # 34 ; , I shudder to see what the poor quality would be . There were a number of disappointing features to this kit but the greatest one was the paint . Maybe I am just accustomed to the effect that oil based paint brings to the picture ~ texture and richness of color ~ and expected more of acrylic than it can deliver . This is very thin , covers poorly and results in a flat , dull , washed out finish . Unlike other kits , there was a lot of messy color mixing to be done . There is a difference between a good and a frustrating challenge ~ this was definitely the latter . Tiny spaces to paint that are difficult for even an experienced paint by number artist do not add to the enjoyment or the attractiveness of the finished picture . Not worth the financial or time investment .	-1
Looking at the picture , you 'd never guess how difficult this one is to do . There are so many tiny spaces and the paintbrush provided is too big to use on them . There is a lot of mixing of colors necessary . The numbers , letters and lines are too dark so you have to go over them several coats to cover them up and there is n't that much paint provided so to do a good job , you 'd probably end up ordering more paint . I do n't know because I gave up on it .	-1
What a terrible product , they did n't last ten minutes before breaking . They did work correctly at all . Guess I should of realized the price was so cheap because it was made so cheap.. Do not reccomend at all , do n't waste any money on these.Now , this is just my opinion , somebody else might say they like it , but I really doubt it .	-1
Anytime I buy something `` cheap '' I always get three ... .in case a few do n't do the trick.I was lucky with this . Only things that works better are================================ > TJ Wisemen RCFM222 Remote Controlled Fart Machine No . 2and================================ > Campbell 's Pork & Beans 11 oz . ( 6-Pack ) Great gag those fart whistles . Heck , I like just SAYING it !	-1
My daughter tried the whistle Christmas morning , it sounded more like a duck . If you want to hear fart sounds save your 2.00 go to the grocery store and buy a can of pork n beans .	-1
I think that the title speaks for itself . Fun idea for boys , but , does not last any time at all , and they all laughed because it sounds like a goose instead of ... well what it is supposed to sound like . I would say , avoid .	-1
dont waste your money or time on this item . It so does NOT sound like a fart and broke after one use , if you can even get it to work in the first place . not recommended .	-1
They work . Thats about the best thing about them . They are way to big for a kids head so they will fall off a lot . If your kids is not 7 or up do n't even bother . Very square in the design so they look funny on . If I could do it again I would have paid for the Spy Gear Brand of these . Likely I will have to anyway cause these are cheap thin plastic . I 'm sure they will suffer a fatal blow soon .	-1
I was expecting this to be like the classic 8 Ball of days gone by , or even like the current 8 Ball available on Amazon . The idea is there but the application is lacking . You have to shake and shake , then maneuver the ball around so the cube can display its message . Not fun at all . Plain and Simple ? It does n't work .	-1
The flote came broken from the Wand	-1
Flimsy and difficult for me to perform . Feather/flower kept getting stuck in the wand and the magnet was not strong enough ...	-1
Realistic ? Not really . I did somehow manage to scare two coworkers , but they 're the two who always scream when there 's a mouse anyways . The coloring of the mouse is just a little too off . There 's too much pink .	-1
I bought this as a joke and it didnt work , friend knew immediately it was fake ! ... ... complete fail , I regret this purchase !	-1
I actually did n't even open these because they were too small . My son is 11 months old and I 'm sure they would be fine , but they were just too small for him to enjoy .	-1
I mean , HE PLAYS WITH DOLLS IN HIS FRICKING 20 'S ! ! ! ! And Bratz suck , another thing .	-1
EWWW i lyuv bratz n evrythin but this doll is ugly ! ! ! She looks so cheap n nasty n y r her legs painted ORANGE ! ! ! ! ! I kept this cloe but i never touch her there is a 1st time 4 evrythin n this is the 1st time a cloe doll has been ugly ! . I hate her so much grrr lolpeaceemma xxxxxxxxxxx	-1
Must . Have . Cataract . Surgery . Or learn to read Braille . Are you people blind ? Because if you 're not already you will be after you look at this Bratz . It looks like someone ingested the sun and threw it up all over this doll . ALL . OVER . IT . Not to mention she only comes with one outfit , and your money could be oh so much better spent on something less visually SCARRING . Not worse than the magenta and aquamarin Yasmin , though . That thing is just an ATROCITY . But I digress , you like it , you buy it . Just as long as I do n't have to look at it.Muja , Centra	-1
No , no , no ! I totally like that they continued Phoebe and Roxxi on by themselves , but this doll sort of looks like not such a good thing ; the clothes are cool but here 's my one complaint : `` Why on Earth did they paint the legs and feet in the shoes black ? '' It really takes away from the beauty and quality of this doll if you ask me . This doll could easily have a five star rating if it was n't for those legs that look like wetsuit pants ! ~KAZAMI AMI	-1
When the first editon Twiinz : Phoebe and Roxxi came out , Phoebe was my favorite . But then , when i saw this doll , i quickly changed my mind . This is..really really bad looking . Not only is she cheap looking , but her hair also gets terribly matted . The outfits are ugly , and the green makes me sick . Sorry , but this , and the other I Candy dolls , have got to go ! If you want a good Phoebe doll , you may have to wait a while because even Campfire Phoebe is n't that great . You do n't have to listen to me , but thats my opinion . If you want a kind of *cute* - *girly* doll , try one from the Ooh La La collection . Those are perfect .	-1
This toy was not to my kids ' tastes . Neither played with it ( ages 6 & 7 when recieved ) so it went into the garage sale pile . No one purchased it at the garage sale either .	-1
I was excited that my brother gave this to my son for Christmas , because I am a fan of wooden toys ... the less toxic plastic toys around the better as far as I am concerned . However I was VERY disappointed when the paint started chipping off . It was coming off and sticking to my hands ... there was no way I was going to let my son play with it ! I returned the defective item .	-1
I purchased 3 Doug & Melissa toys for my grandson , while he loves the colors and they are easy to handle , every single one of the toys has chipping paint . Poorly painted and since we do n't really know what the paint is we no longer allow him to play with these toys . I am surprised that toys clearly intended for rough play , i.e. , pounding , grabbing , throwing , do n't last more than a few days . Disappointed !	-1
One of the wooden dowels came unglued within the first 2 days my daughter was playing with it . Also , the largest wooden ( red ) circle is very resistant to go on the dowel or come off of it . She likes the toy , but get mad because she ca n't play with the red circle , and gets upset when it come apart .	-1
We bought one just like this in Target , made for Target and it has none of the problems listed on this product . Paint is still intact after many plays , looks still like new and we have so much fun with it . Stacking and sorting colors , making color piles , then shape piles , then stack by color , by shape etc . It has lots of uses to prevent boredom . Great toy . Yes , you should be careful not to have in laying down in the middle of the room or someplace where your toddler can fall on it . Clean up after play and just have fun with this .	-1
To begin playing , take the blocks off the poles . At first I was worried she would fall over and hurt herself on these exposed poles . Next , the poles fell off , which then exposes this clear glue which my child wants to chew on.Just like the sorting cube I bought with this , the colored paint chips off . The square is 2 shapes which fit to be a square . Seems like a good advanced concept , but mostly concerned of the sharp edges . So those were put away.I should have bought one of the plastic versions of this . The paint would not have chipped off . And maybe the poles would have been attached to the base rather than adhered with toxic glue .	-1
I really like Melissa & Doug toys however , we 've only had this toy for two days and with three children playing with it ( total probably 4 hours of play so far ) , the sticks were not glued into base and quickly popped off ( the baby did that first thing after removing all the pieces ) . The other part I did not like was the fact that paint is starting to come off already on the square pieces ( on the corners ) . Even if the paint is lead-free , I still do n't think it should come off after two days of play . I am hoping to write the company and ask them about that .	-1
A friend got this for our toddler . It 's a great idea but poorly executed . We did n't have any problems with paint or anything like that . Problem is , when the pieces come off , you are left with three thin dowels/stands sticking straight up . Anyone who has a toddler knows that is an accident waiting to happen . One trip head first into this thing and the dowels are thin enough to take out an eye . Also , the edges are not smoothed down , so it also has the potential to tear skin if landed on.I would suggest that Melissa and Doug use MUCH thicker stands that are smoothed and rounded at the top .	-1
The toy we received did n't look like the plush toy in the photo . It looked smashed and was poor quality . Yes , it sings and dances but it looks like a very , very USED toy and not the new , plush toy I was expecting . I am extremely disappointed .	-1
Bought 2 of these for grandsons to play on the patio & in the pool . Really disappointing as they barely moved in the pool & only lasted for a few times of play . Not worth the price in my opinion .	-1
So , this car looks cool and all but its not that great . It worked fine , it rolls and floats but quality and enjoyability ( if that is a word ) is poor . Purchased for a 6 yr old ( Christmas 2013 ) .1 ) Car is small and difficult to control . If you push up both joy sticks the car does not drive stright . Same thing backing up . Wheels just have different tourque which makes it very , very , very hard to get the car to go in the direction you want . My kid gave up after awhile.2 ) Controller unit is not made very well . Feels cheap and & # 34 ; is & # 34 ; cheap.3 ) Water control . We took the car to a small lake ( no or very little wind on this day ) . It was kind of fun driving around the lake near the shore . Another child dropped a ball in the lake and we attempted to use the car to push the ball towards us ... again , no control over this thing.In summary ; if you do n't care which way the car goes , I guess its ok . But my child grew frustrated quickly as controls are cheap and very bad.Save your money is my bottomline .	-1
TERRIBLE . Bought it for our son and the 1st time he used it , it broke . Well it broke after it ran out of batteries . Do n't waste your time or money .	-1
We were excited for this car and bought it for out 4 year old for Christmas . it came quickly and looked like a lot of fun . However , the remote only works when standing right next to the car . It had about a 3 foot range , and as soon as the car got out of range , it would stop . We were forced to return it .	-1
I bought this toy because of it 's durability , which is necessary for a 2 and 1/2 year old . Well , we 've had this toy for about 2 months . My son loved to play with this toy . He felt like a big boy because it was faster than his Umi Zoomi car . He spent about a half hour a day trying to master the remote , so it was no surprise when the battery seemed to be dying . Only one side of the car would spin , so naturally , it 's time for a battery change right ? Wrong ! The wheel gave one buzz and nothing . I thought that I might have put in the batteries in the wrong way . NURP ! We changed the batteries in the remote just in case.. light came on but no action . The toy was dead.My son sat there waiting anxiously to play with his now favorite toy again and nothing . I had to explain to him that it was broken . Why sell such a defective toy if it 's a piece of crap ? God forbid we actually let him run it through water . I 'm very disappointed .	-1
I bought this for my two boys for Christmas this past year . It was great in theory , I liked the different tracks you could build and it was sturdy , BUT , not even 24 hours after opening it , the cars did n't work anymore . I was quite upset by this , as I spent $ 100 for this set . If the cars would have worked , it would be a great item , but for the money , I would have expected the cars to last longer ! They are n't cheap to buy separately either . So , now the tub just sits up on a shelf .	-1
This thing for the adults and the kids is like a painful nightmare . Trying to sit on it is truly the whole point of this & # 34 ; game & # 34 ; . My husband and son suggested they may never be able to have kids after a battle on these . I found it impossible to stay on . And , I found they deflated so quickly . It just was n't fun .	-1
We broke them all open and the boy was quite disappointed , not much inside most were empty and a few had only clear quartz . I would have done better going to the store letting him pick out the different colored rocks . Do n't waste your money with these .	-1
I bought these as christmas gifts . So , kids have n't played yet . From the packaging I do n't think they 'll be very durable . Seems like they will come apart . I hope I 'm wrong . I do think my 5 , 8 and 10yr olds will like it while it lasts . But , will is last ? is the question . I think it 's a great idea .	-1
I bought this with a figure 8 in mind . Track plus a low Thomas train does not fit under the bridge .	-1
My review is on this review and NOT this seller . I 've even tried contacting the manufacturer with photos , with no response . We purchased four of these floats and , like most people , we stacked them after getting out of the pool . OMG ! ! ! They stuck together ! ! ! The floats now look BAD ! The coating has come away , after pulling them apart . Even in the pool , if they bump into each other , they will stick . So it 's a MUST to take them out of the pool after swimming and you ca n't stack them . A waste of money , especially considering how much we paid for them . FOUR of them ! NOT HAPPY !	-1
One of these broke with in 48 hours of opening the box . It just freezes up and the numbers on the screen wo n't change , the drawer wo n't open , nothing . We received a replacement which lasted 5 months before the screen froze up again and the whole thing stopped working . Once the screen freezes up , it wo n't work at all to do anything with.Cute idea but this brand is a piece of junk.P.S . the money it comes with has been fun for my kids and the designs on the paper bills look real , my kids have had fun partially hiding it and watching my face when I thought I found a random $ 100 bill	-1
You 've seen the other reviews where this happened , straight out of the box it was n't working , well that 's what happened to us . It had a message on the screen saying & # 34 ; CD open & # 34 ; ( cash drawer ) we could n't get it to do anything else . I will say that the money , both paper and coin , was accurate and easy to see what it was so I think it would be really fun to play with and a good learning tool . The other thing that in hindsight I would suggest is the colors . While this register seems like a really good one , the primary colors are not really fun . I sat down with my 3.5 year old granddaughter and got onto Amazon to look at possible replacements . Even though this one was still sitting in our living room and she had been trying madly to play with it , she did n't even glance at it on Amazon but went straight to the pink and fun colored ones . I kept trying to explain why this one was better than those but she was n't having it . The reality is , it 's for HER , she will figure out money one way or another , so why not get her what she wants . I doubt that when we are playing restaurant she will be nit picky about having accurate looking money .	-1
I was really disappointed ... I am considering getting a real cash register to use with my 8 year old . He liked the idea but this machine is not only annoying , the draw pop out too fast , it froze its a computer ) , it scans anything , cute but Ive never heard of a pencil that costs $ 16.05..anyhow ... back to the drawing board ! $ 40 is too much for this toy ...	-1
Unfortunately , the register came directed . It was a gift for my friend 's son who loves numbers . He loves this toy so much that spends hours couting . I wish that all the features would work but the numbers on the screen do n't add up the amount.The company handled it well and gave me a refund right away . However , I 'm going to get a deferent type of register .	-1
My 5 YO received thisas CHristmas gift - looked fantastic . First of all , drawer shoots out so fast and hard all money flies all over the place . THIS is not the big issue , tho . Within 5 minutes of playing with it , it displayed an error code & # 34 ; CR OPEN & # 34 ; or something like that - which is supposed to mean the drawer is open ( it was not ) ... and even after trying to reset , it would not correct itself . SO we had it replaced . Cash register # 2 seemed like a winner ... it outlasted 5 minutes , but not by long ... after about 20 minutes , same problem.Total disappointment - returning both of them .	-1
I must be one of the unlucky ones who purchased one of the & # 34 ; lemons. & # 34 ; Bought this for my daughter for Christmas and she did n't play with it right away . I threw the box out , Amazon receipt , etc . and once we started playing with it , it was past the 30-day manufacturer warranty anyway , so I 'm out of luck.The screen goes crazy . You push buttons and it does n't recognize what buttons you 're pushing on the screen . It started making consistent beeping noises and the screen just had a bunch of lines on it . I tried using the reset button on the bottom , turned it off/on , removed the batteries ... .but it still starts acting up right away after rebooting . I 'm so mad ! Stuck with this piece of junk . This would be a really cool toy if it worked.BUYER BEWARE !	-1
Santa bought this for christmas for my 3 year old , it did not work with the first set of fresh batteries so ran out on chrismas day to find more new batteries , after searching around found one gas station with an open store so bought the batteries it worked fine for some time with the new set of batteries , and the very next day mal functioned again , the lights on the scanner and the toy just lit up doing nothing . Very frustrating and tried to change the batteries and that reversing the toy made it work again for some time and again after couple hrs same problem and this time it did not work , i change the batteries again and nothing , i spend 25 $ on new batteries alone and i just gave up and returned it.It would have been a great toy if it worked now my 3 year old is disappointed that i returned santa 's toy and santa would n't come again until next christmas : ( .	-1
This was my first Learning resources product and I had been eyeing this for a few months for my 2 year old . He is really into numbers and math and enjoys anything that displays numbers or looks like a calculator . I was very pleased when he received this as a late christmas gift yesterday from his best friend 's family . We brought it home and both opened it together , he was immediately enthralled with it , but after a few moments we noticed the register display kept showing `` CB Open '' We reset the machine , made sure the drawer as well as the coin bank were properly clicked and closed . We even took the battery out , replaced it and no matter what we did the same thing displays on the register screen . This does not deter my son from putting the coins in and pushing the number buttons , but we requested this toy for the multitude of features it would have , so it seems like a waste to have it used at what I would consider a 20 % capacity without the features it should have thanks to the display.Unfortunately the seller It was purchased from has run out of stock of this merchandise so I 've written to Learning Resources directly to see if they will offer an exchange or a fix . We 'll see what happens . I certainly hope for the best . My end goal is to get one that works as I see how much my son already loves it at less then 3/4 of the features ... . We look forward to enjoying it fully soon !	-1
I tricked myself into thinking this might be okay to buy as many seem to like it . Well I certainly lost the gamble . There were n't any toy cash registers I saw out there that had good ratings so I tried to use the best one I could find.Two issues ; one is small one is a major problem.1 ) Every time the drawer is opened a bunch of coins fly out . Yep this happens.2 ) I got this thing , put it together ( a few pieces and money ) , and started hitting buttons with my 4 year old daughter . From the minute it came out of the box it reported the drawer was open when it was not . Well it might not be so bad , but you ca n't do anything with the keys when the drawer is reported as open ; it just complains . I was n't going to let my daughters Christmas morning be ruined so easily so I fixed this horrible design flaw , but I should n't have had to.Take out all of the bottom screws and open up the register . Take out one or two of the screws that hold that transparent piece of plastic to the top of the cash drawer . You will see a very small switch in the back of the drawer ( I mean like so small it is the wrong application for this small of a switch ) . It has the give of about a penny and two pieces of duct tape ( seriously ) . So basically just put two pieces of duct tape over a penny and tape it to the back of the drawer where it hits this switch . This fixes the drawer open issue , but invites other things you should know about it . If you use a penny and a dime it wo n't work as when you apply pressure to this switch it applies back pressure on the very cheaply made open button mechanical arm . Well , a few pennies or a penny and a dime will get the switch shut and the door activated , but the Open button wo n't work . I had to use exactly a penny and two overlapping pieces of duct tape . Unfortunately the door now opens with even a bit more force which exasperates problem one a bit more . Teach the child to put their hand in front of the door and it works out fine.So in the end ... . This is an over priced , under developed product . I so want to just send this hunk of junk back . They could have either omitted the whole switch thing or put a decent switch in this thing . One ca n't use a micro-switch if the level of quality is n't high enough to ensure the tolerances are met and sustained over the life of the product to accommodate the switch.It took me a penny and two pieces of duct tape to fix this product , why could n't your engineers and designers figure it out ?	-1
I purchased this toy for my 14 month based on the high reviews . When it arrived I found the product to be cheap in construction , the spiral separates easily . The paint on the penquins wore off within a month of gentle play . This toy is particularly stimulating . My daughter found it more entertaining to blow into the vented bottom section of the frog . It sounds like a harmonic when she does this . With the exception of the frog ( being used in a way not intended ) she has paid little attention over the past 4 months . I will be taking this dust collector to the donation center .	-1
I bought this a part of a beginner & # 34 ; ready to fly & # 34 ; set . If I continue with this hobby I will look for a cheaper alternative . This produce is way , way overpriced .	-1
The only reason I am giving this tunnel 2 stars is because the tunnel is so narrow that the popular Thomas the tank engines and friends that run on batteries and fit on all the wooden rails ways will not fit into the tunnel . The tunnel itself is made of solid heavy wood and made very well , we just cant use it with the trains we have . Very disappointed .	-1
Too small for thomas trains and does n't fit the maxim shed . That really says it all , do n't buy unless you have a complete maxim set , maybe it works with those ?	-1
I bought this for my 3 yr old son for xmas and was very disappointed . The wooden connector piece that came with it did not fit at all . it wasnt cut right and he was very upset .	-1
This little wagon is adorable but that 's about it ! It 's teeny tiny . The handle is so short that my 1 1/2 year old can not pull it without stooping a bit . It often turns over on its side when changing directions . In my opinion , this wagon is better for looking at than playing with . It would look really cute in a boys room on top of a dresser with a stuffed animal in it .	-1
I guess I should have read the product description more carefully . I was looking for a wagon that my daughter could carry her toys in , but instead , it 's not big enough to carry much of anything . I will be returning this and looking for something bigger .	-1
I was told that these & # 34 ; babies & # 34 ; were posable.They are NOT ! ! The set is cute , but not What I wanted	-1
The Ballerina Jewelry Box was a gift for our granddaughter . I was disappointed because the winding feature would not work . A simple test before shipping would have fixed an uneventful birthday gift . I returned it .	-1
I bought this for my grandson and although he still plays with parts and loves it , it started falling apart almost immediately . It is very cute , but not at all durable . If it were a lot cheaper , it would n't be so bad . If something fell apart , it would be more understandable . But , for the price , was definitely disappointed .	-1
We have a few other Lauri toys and have liked this . This one did n't work for us . The material is flimsy -- very thin so difficult to play with on carpet , which is what our playroom has . The puzzles are very small so the higher numbers like 10 are just a pain .	-1
I bought this for my daughter and promptly `` donated it '' to a charitable cause after receiving the product and saw the packaging indicated it was made in China . NO THANK YOU ! I 'm done buying Melissa and Doug products ... .who CLAIM their products are MADE IN THE USA .	-1
This poor guy just did not like keeping his air . He must have been too used to a non-oxygen environment .	-1
It looks great . Within two seconds ( when I was just checking it out myself ) the doors fell off and they do n't open when the buttons are pushed half the time . I think for the price these things should work . Lost two of the red doors already , wondering where I can buy replacement doors ? My son likes it anyway . Likes the whole set in general and plays with it everyday . Has a magenetic light and sound signal which was much less but is his favorite piece .	-1
Very cheaply made would not buy again . The kids liked it but did not last very long ! Would not buy !	-1
I got this for my 2 boys- ages 7 and 4 . For the first 15 minutes it was a lot of fun , then the stand kept coming apart and the boys were getting frustrated that they had to put it back together all the time . Then 2 of the rockets landed on the roof ( they probably should have launched away from the house in a clearing ) . By the end of about 2 hours the stand was apart , all the rockets were lost or broken and the kids totally lost interest . If the parts were of better quality it would have been a great toy .	-1
One of the two Stomp Rockets I bought was terrific . No complaints , it was a hit with the Grandkids.The second kit was a disaster . The RED AIR pouch that you jump at to make the thing fly was completely closed up . A manufacturing defect ! ! ! ! ! ! It should have been noticed at the factory if they had a quality control person but I am sure they do not have enough 13 year olds to do that job . I had to use a drill bit to make an air passage into the RED POUCH.I will say that was a bad experience .	-1
The tripod wo n't stay together . Assemble it and it falls back apart . The fins come off of the rockets after not too many launches . It 's a shame it was n't better engineered it was fun while it lasted ( 10 minutes ) .	-1
I bought the dot art paints and bought this book specifically for my children to be able to fill empty dots with their pens.It has very few dots in it throughout . I 'm extremely disappointed and would n't recommend this expensive book ( for what it was ) to anyone . Go to Oriental Trading Co to find dot art sheets . Much cheaper ! Their product is n't in book form , but they actually have dots on their papers !	-1
My 2 1/2 year old played with these once and that was IT ! He prefers the hotwheels and matchbox cars much MUCH more . This product is better suited for kids under 2 years of age IMO .	-1
Especially given the steep price , I do not recommend this set of vehicles . They are OK -- colorful , diverse pieces , but why would any one child need 15 of these ? ? ? If you have twins or triplets or run a daycare for 1 year olds this is the perfect item . Otherwise no need for this !	-1
I bought this for a birthday gift for my 5 year old and it was only used once . It just did n't keep her interest . The quality is good , but not the most interesting method to spell these days .	-1
The best thing is , it is cute and it 's red . The quality is not the greatest . Do n't expect it to last forever , but it is darling .	-1
I got this for my almost 3 years daughter 's Christmas present . First of all when we wanted to assemble the chair , 2 of the screws were missing . My husband managed to somehow make it happen since the kiddo was really excited . Now after less than a month I can see the the wooden part on top is a little inflated ! ! ! we live in LA not even a humid area which may affect the quality of woods . Anyways ... . not happy with the quality . But the design is nice and can make your kids happy	-1
My almost four-year-old loves to sort and count so I thought these would make a nice stocking stuffer for her this year . I did n't expect them to be her favorite present because I knew she would be getting flashier , larger toys , but I thought that after things had calmed down I could set her up with them at the table and she 'd enjoy sorting the bears into cups . Unfortunately , the first of cups broke before she even got to play with them at all . She had taken them out of the packages and looked them over before ( as expected ) getting distracted by a different toy , so I picked them up and put them in the box with her puzzles and other toys that contain small pieces . A few days later when I went to get them out I discovered that the blue cup was cracked all the way down the side . I know she had n't played with them for more than a few minutes that first day , and for them to break that quickly is really disappointing . They are about the thickness of those plastic cups that come with some egg dying kits . I ca n't help but think that they could 've invested in somewhat stronger/thicker plastic in order to make these toys durable . I 'll probably replace the blue cup with a small drinking cup and hopefully she 'll still get some use out of the set , but I would n't advise buying this particular sorting set due to how easily this one became damaged .	-1
The idea behind Hot Dots - making learning more fun - is great , but the execution just is n't there . The flashcards are rather thin , and unless you have the pen aligned perfectly on the dot and perfectly up and down , which what 5-9 year olds are going to , you get inaccurate results . My 7 year old is constantly complaining that she chose the correct answer , but the pen said it was incorrect . Very frustrating for her !	-1
I am a homeschool mom and I had high hopes for this . We used this twice ( not for long and very gentle ) and on the third time it did n't turn on .	-1
I wanted to like this , and I went into the purchase with low expectations given some of the other reviews . I tried it out when I got it out of the package and found the screen incredibly hard to read . Overall , it seemed to be made okay , but the screen was a deal breaker . The buttons were a bit hard to press , but not outrageous . I returned it that day . Back to the drawing board , hoping to find something with a few bells and whistles to make multiplication practice a little less boring .	-1
The level selection is not very easy to use . If I do n't set it up on the proper level for each child , a kid will just turn it on and proceed to do the easiest level , whether or not it 's what 's appropriate for him . Also the screen display is only so-so . This has not come very far from the Little Professor of the early 1980s . In fact , I like the Little Professor better because the level selection is an easy slider bar for 1 , 2 , 3 , or 4th level .	-1
I loved Clue growing up , so when my mother asked me for gift ideas for my 8-year-old son , I suggested Clue Jr.Among other board games geared to his age , he received Clue Jr. as a Christmas present and was THRILLED . ( He likes mysteries just like his Mom ! ) Unfortunately , our glee was short-lived.My brother 's girlfriend , her 12-year-old son , my son , and I sat down to play this game . My brother 's girlfriend read the instructions , and we tried to figure out what to do with the color coded stickers -- and how to even BEGIN play . Now , let me just say that both of us are board game aficionados who played zillions of games of Clue in our day . I have a genius IQ and she 's a pediatric nurse . In short , we ai n't stupid.Yet , even mid-game , we had a hard time figuring out how to move the game pieces , how to discover clues to mark off the checklist , and so on . You see , each player does NOT have a specific game piece as in regular Clue . Instead , you peel off small stickers to place under the white bases ( the green `` crumb '' label indicating the culprit and five time labels ) and yellow drink labels to the five yellow bases.Then , you roll a color-coded die to determine if you should look under a yellow furniture pawn , under a white character pawn , or move ANY CHARACTER forward up to the number rolled on the dice . If a character lands on a yellow space , look at the bottom of the furniture piece that 's in the room ( for example , the plant on the patio ) . Then , secretly look under the furniture pawn that 's next to that room.Even now , as I 'm re-reading the instructions , I 'm having a hard time understanding what to do ! ( So it does n't make for easy reviewing , let alone playing ! ) Not only that , there 's not a lot of room on the game board for putting furniture pieces BESIDE a room ... let alone IN it ! We were so frustrated and bored that all four of us agreed to quit -- and play Pictionary Jr. , instead.If you 're feeling nostalgic and are tempted to buy Clue Jr. for a child , RESIST THE URGE . You 'll be wasting your money and time in my opinion . ( We 're returning the game this weekend , in fact . ) The pieces are chintzy , the game play is confusing , and it does n't even come with pencils !	-1
This is literally a dumbed-down version of the standard Clue game . Basically , one needs to determine which animal has taken which toy to the dog house ( which stands next to the board . ) Players take turns to toss the die , which determines how many steps to take . The characters in the game are the younger versions of the same characters in the regular Clue game : Mr.Green is Johnny Green ( a cheerful kid ) . And these characters are cardboard cutouts that fit onto white plastic pieces ( people movers ) . The bottom of the white pieces have different pictures on them ( clues ) . But the characters themselves actually play no part in the game . There are several pieces of furniture ( also cardboard cutouts ) that fit onto white plastic pieces . Under these pieces are other clues . During the game , one must travel across the board ( which does not take many steps ) to check under each clue piece in order to determine which two pieces are missing.The good part is that one does not need to be able to read in order to play this game : the detective 's note pad uses pictures instead . So if you know the dog is not missing , you can place a mark next to the picture of the dog.The bad parts , and there are many , include : the pieces are made top heavy , and they have to , due to the nature of the game , often occupy the same spot . But , there is little space on the board for pieces to occupy the same spot . As a result , they fall easily and reveal the hidden clues . This happens very often with young players ( and this game IS made for the very young ones ) . The way this game is designed makes process of deduction appear rather haphazard.If you have a kid that can read -- even if s/he is only a beginning reader , even if your kid can spell enough to figure out a word , I suggest you move right onto the standard Clue game . Yes , at the beginning , the standard game may be a bit hard to master . But it offers enough intrigue that most kids will grow to enjoy it .	-1
The age on my box says 5+ . This game is for much older children or for very advanced 5 year olds . If you 're looking for a learning resource to teach younger children to read , then this might be good for you . If you 're looking for a fun game to play with your child , do n't buy this game ; you 'll be disappointed .	-1
I bought this toy for my 4 month old twins who just became interested in squishing toys that make noise . I bought this and a few other `` crinkle '' toys . However , when I got this I quickly realized this is not a `` crinkle '' toy ... there is no crinkle ... just a little rattle on the end . So far , they have n't shown much interested in this ... even at almost 6 months of age . I threw it in their diaper bag since it is small and I needed some travel toys , but other than that ... they do n't care for it much . Not sure why the name is `` crinkle '' when there is no crinkle !	-1
This is a very boring game . I find that the rules leave so much to the imagination that there really is very little boundaries or structure . I do not recommend this game .	-1
I got this game and had high hopes for it with my Wednesday gaming group . But the rules leave room for interpretation and we had several disagreements with each other as to what goes in or on something else . We did the democratic thing and voted to solve disputes , but still this game left a bad taste in some peoples ' mouths . As a result , I stopped bringing this game and gave it away at a Christmas raffle . It 's intended to be fun , but be prepared for some disagreements among players .	-1
Within five seconds , it jammed and all of the marshmallows were stuck inside . What a joke of a toy !	-1
Grandkids had trouble keeping the marshmallows hard enough to shoot ! Kept getting stuck in the shooter ! Not a good idea to use below 50 degrees !	-1
This toy was extremely disappointing for my 8 year old son . He was so excited to get this as a gift and it broke , literally , after one use . I usually read reviews before purchasing a toy product , but this time I did not . I wish I had read all the prior reviews that stated its drawbacks because they were accurate . Bottom line : a toy should not have so many parameters you must follow to make sure it works correctly . Children will tend to overfill the magazine and just by touching the marshmellows to insert them , you are softening them to the point they will not shoot properly ! Do n't waste your money ... ... .buy a Nerf gun instead !	-1
If I buy a battery for a power wheels car I should very well get a free charger with it , the whole world of electronics works that way , this should n't be any different	-1
This set is cute and fun for my beginner engineer . The trains are well made . And I got the set for a decent pre-Christmas price , and getting a battery powered Thomas with it makes it a pretty good buy for a starter set . I do n't even mind that the battery powered Thomas typically eats an AA battery every day or two . Here comes the big BUT other reviewers have mentioned . For the amount of money you pay for Thomas items , these tracks do not hold together well . And the battery powered Thomas is constantly tipping over on the curves , or if it 's pulling other trains they tip over on the hill . My son loves this set but gets very frustrated when his trains keep going off track . I wo n't be returning it because he has loved playing with it daily since he got it . But really , I 'm going to try another brand of track for expansion . Most of the off-brand tracks are n't made with traction to supposedly improve the performance of the battery powered trains , but I 'm willing to give them a shot , as you get a lot more track for the money , and the performance of these is not impressive . I also just ordered the track locking clips sold on amazon , which I hope will help . I knew I 'd have to spend more to expand our Thomas collection , but I did n't count on having to spend more just to get good performance from this set .	-1
The idea of this toy is cute & a great concept ... We bought this for my daughter when she was 3 months old - she was kicking like crazy at the time so we thought this was the perfect toy - WRONG ! ! 1st of all , she was in the 100 % for her height and that said , the toy was way too tall off the ground for her to reach and play with it ... 2nd - when she kicked it , nothing happened ... we later found , it does n't have an activated kick pad ! 3rd - 3 of the 4 boxes that I purchased , items were missing ( screws , batteries , etc . ) - come to find out it was because multiple were returns ! ! I was lucky the store i bought it from took it back assembled ( b/c I no longer had the box ) - this was n't worth a penny ! ! ( even though it says it can grow with them - my daughter has always been big for her age - she 's still in the 95 % for her weight - so she would have outgrown the weight limit to sit on it before she was even able to use that function ) ...	-1
I believe this is the same lite brite I have . In any case , it required 6 D batteries and to buy that many batteries is about $ 18 , so I am no amused that to play with this you need to spend 2x more . I have never put any batteries in it and it sits in my closet . Not worth it .	-1
I bought this with fond memories of my childhood lightbright . I honestly thought my 5 year old son would love this.First , it 's really cheaply made . Thin plastic junk , typical of the toys coming out today.The drawer is convenient , but sticks . Almost every time we 've opened , pegs have gone flying everywhere because of the difficulty in opening the drawer.It is battery operated . You press the button and it automatically shuts off after 3 minutes . I 'd prefer the electric type to this.It does n't stand up well , if at all.You ca n't push a peg in without holding it or propping it against something . It 's just not the toy I remember . I would n't buy this again and I definitely would not give this as a gift .	-1
This is not the Lite Brite I remember . The basics are the same , but the details of this new version are very irritating . First of all , the light has no `` off '' button , so once you push the button that turns the light ON , it stays on for 3 minutes , whether you want it to or not . So if you like taking a quick peek to see how your creation is coming , but then turning the light off so you get that `` surprise ooh ahh '' moment in the end when you finally illuminate your picture , you 're out of luck . The light goes on , and stays on . ( Unless you remove the batteries from the back , which is hard to do without making the pegs fall out . ) Also , the handy-dandy peg holder is almost impossible to open . My 3 year old ca n't make it budge , and I can only open it with difficulty . Bad design . Also , be sure to have 3 D batteries handy ( ka-ching ! ) when you open this up , or your kid may be disappointed . I personally would prefer a plug . I wish these `` improvements '' actually improved this toy , instead of making it more frustrating !	-1
Just got it now have to send it back and order another one . Although the retail packaging seems sufficient and it was packaged appropriately there were dirty marks and rub marks on the snout and ears , which mostly came off with all-purpose cleaner but not all . Also looks to be some sort of shiny residue on one side , maybe glue that does n't come off . No one should have to clean a brand new product to try and make it acceptable for keeping . That 's poor quality .	-1
The pump is a pain . Too small . Good for petite or kids , but I am 5'4 '' and the & # 34 ; 65 '' & # 34 ; is too small ... . The chart inside is neat . Selling at a garage sale due to shipping costs being greater than price .	-1
We got two of these for our girls . We doubled checked to make sure all of the sides were nice and tight yet when we poured in the plaster , it leaked all over the place . My girls were very disappointed . They ended up just painting the plastic pieces and using the little plastic tube to make the volcano in , but I would n't recommend this .	-1
was n't impressed ... the mold was fine and the volcano overall look ... but we could have done the experiement without paying so much ...	-1
Buy some pop and mentos and forget this . How disappointing for the child who just painted this thing to watch it NOT erupt .	-1
These are so flimsy that if we 're sitting on the carpet and push a piece down , other pieces pop off as the plate flexes . They 're also not Lego-bottomed , so we ca n't use them in between , as say floors in a house . Our older plates are made of real Lego stuff , but perhaps they 've altered their design . The smaller base plates ( 16x16 , maybe ) that we recently got with a Lego Friends set are also this flexible stuff . Not as versatile as the older version , and pretty much useless as bases for big projects.Also disappointed by Amazon 's return policy with regard to these , which requires that we pay shipping and get only an unquantified 'partial ' refund . Honestly , they 're not worth the space they take up . We 're going to wind up throwing them away . Total waste of good money .	-1
UPDATE : I WAS ABLE TO CHANGE THE LANGUAGE TO ENGLISH ON WEBSITE . COMPANY RESPONDED TO MY COMPLAINT AND PROMPTLY SENT A FREE REPLACEMENT . VERY GOOD SERVICEMy daughter loved this ball so it was very disappointing when the handle broke in half down the center ! ! She only had it for 9 months . I am unable to contact the company because everything is in Italian on the website . I tried to send an email , however , I am not sure I will receive a response . There is no telephone number listed either .	-1
We got these when my kids were moving beyond 48 pieces . The picture was fine and of high interest for boys . But the puzzle was very poorly made . Right out of the box , a few pieces were already peeling apart - picture side from the hard-board or cardboard backing . Also , some pieces were slightly warped and would n't lay flat . The $ 4 puzzles at Walmart and Target are better-made than this junk !	-1
There isn ' enough variety of peices in this set . my son tried to build stuff with it , but there are n't enough roof peices or smaller peices . Just tons of big peices . I tried gettting creative and playing with them with him , but I soon realized that you just really ca n't put anything creative together with the lack of peices . I ended up donating the whole set to good will .	-1
Buy the Lincoln logs . Yes , you will pay more for name brand , but they are better constructed and stay together much better than this cheap nock off brand . I bought these to save a few bucks and it was a mistake . The roofs do not fit together and there is a large space at the top . Because the logs are rounded , they slip apart unlike the Lincoln Logs which are shaped like hexegons and stay together much better . Spend a few extra bucks and save on your kids crying when their cabin falls down .	-1
First it came with the packaging open and then as soon as my son took it out it was so easily broken . Hopefully a little glue will fix it .	-1
Purchased this as a stocking stuffer for our daughter . This recorder will not even change key , tone , or anything when you cover the holes . I 'm not a professional musician , but this recorder is not like those I used when I was in grade school . You could actually play those.This is just basically a wooden tube with holes that you blow in . It is not an instrument with which to make music . It unfortunate because we have been happy with every other M & D toy purchase we have made , and there have been a bunch . Thanks for reading .	-1
tHIS IS SUCH A HORRIBL PRODUCT , IT MAKES NO SOUND , THE HOLES ARE COVERED OVER . CHEAP IS CHEAP AND THIS IS BEYOUND CHEAP . I WASY=TED MY TIME EVEN ORDERING IT . GLAD FOR AMAZON SINCE IT WAS SO EASY TO RETURN	-1
I was looking for something easy that my 9 year old could do that was n't too complicated . This claims to be for over age 6 , however , the 'tricks ' are WAY to easy . Seriously , a four year old could do these with no prob . Also , the quality is terrible . The first time we used the sword in the stone the wood piece that holds the metal piece inside ( that releases the sword ) came off ! Anyway , I would n't recommend this at all , too cheap .	-1
My daughter was so excited when she saw this gift . She had been asking for a magic set . I had high hopes for it . To be honest we found this quite boring . My daughter played with it probably a handful of times and that 's it . Kind of disappointing .	-1
the reason I am rating a one is because the orientation/labeling of the tray ... it is the exact opposite of conventional wisdom ( and a real register tray ) , apparently doug and melissa do n't have any ... if you want to throw in some confusion to your money teaching recipe go right ahead , by all meansI instead , through mine in the trash ( tray ) , kept the play money and bought a plastic money traySparco Money Tray , with Locking Cover , 16 x 11 x 2-1/4 Inches , Black ( SPR15505 )	-1
My boys 3 years and 14 months loved this toy , however it only lasted about 3 days before parts of it stopped working . The mechanism that makes the paper move to make it look like the car is driving forward or in reverse on the road kept getting stuck and then simply stopped working . The sound effects started having problems right away too . The starting your engine sound kept repeating over and over again when the toy was turned on . The boys had a lot of fun with it for those 3 day , but once the car in the screen did n't look like it was driving any more and the sound had problems it was no longer any fun . We opened it up to see if we could fix it , but were unsuccessful and ended up throwing it away . I wish that it would have been built sturdier . I do n't think that my boys are any rougher than most , but the toy did n't stand up to occasionally being stood on or dropped . If your kids are really careful with their toys then you probably wo n't have to worry about the Roadster not lasting very long .	-1
I would have given it more stars if the track did n't stop working . It should be able to withstand the abuse of a 2 yr old . I only kept it because of the cool sounds .	-1
I really see no positive point to this toy . The `` no stress '' part involves a labeled chess board and 52 playing cards . 48 of those cards tell you which piece to move , with movement rules . The players follow each card . The instructions say players should have fun , but my little kids , with little chess knowledge to start , found this playing very confusing , having played just a little bit chess via Windows 8 chess apps . For example , if you get a Rook card at the beginning , you ca n't move either of your rooks , so you lose a turn , which makes young players really frustrated amid the confusion . After a few tries , my kids asked me to throw out this toy and went back to chess apps on our Sony Tap 20 computer .	-1
I have two young boys - ages 6 and 8 . They were learning to play chess so I purchased a few products and books designed for teaching chess to young children . Ultimately , this game is a poor quality chess set and nothing more . There is no `` easy '' way to learn chess . My boys were initially taught to play by joining a chess club at school . I wanted products for follow up teaching at home . I much preferred the other game I purchased ... ..Once A Pawn A Time . It was great quality and came with very funny instructional books that were more in depth . I would go with that game instead . Good luck ! It 's not easy for kids to learn chess , but it 's very satisfying for them when they finally learn and master the game .	-1
This chess set is only good for kids/adults that have completely zero exposure to how chess pieces move . My 5yo daughter ( who just started playing last month ) knows how to do the basic chess moves , but she felt too restricted in terms of planning . For example , she wanted to move a piece that was going to get taken , but she could not because the chess cards did not allow her to . My husband and daughter hated it after one game . Oh well .	-1
My daughter , a huge princess fan , got this when she turned 4 . She loved the jewelry . Unfortunately , she did n't want to play the game . We tried it once and she was so bored , we could n't finish it . In fact , the playing pieces got lost pretty quickly , but we do have the jewelry and she loves playing dress-up in them . The game is just not for every princess , but all the kids seem to like the jewelry .	-1
With all the reviews i tried these out . I like that they are eco friendly and they are vibrant colors , but the shape I do n't love as much as I expected to . Either kids are learning how to hold writing devices ( be it crayons , pencils , markers etc ) properly at younger ages or something but when my 20 month old and again at 2 tried using these to color , it was truly awkward for him to use . I 'm not sure how this agape is supposed to do anything for them other than messy attempts at coloring . He was less than thrilled , and so am I after spending the money . To add , I do n't find them very easy to clean off walls or clothes as others mentioned they were . I would stick to their set of fat standard shaped crayons instead . Personally I like the Pkolino crayons much better , and those you can actually clean off things .	-1
Really disappointed that Stockmar MISrepresenting there product . These crayons cost a pretty penny and we think we are getting beeswax . They only contain 10 % beeswax and the rest is petroleum based like any other crayon , NOT HAPPY . Glad I found Filana crayons though . They are made in the USA , contain 25 % beeswax and NO petroleum in them . Check out Filana crayons	-1
I was told these would be manual transmission style but they are in fact AUTOMATIC transmission style . Will return promptly as these are literally ruined .	-1
The handle falls off easily so its not good for a young toddler learning to walk.The seat is VERY wide so unless your [ small kid ] has legs as long as a [ grown up kid ] its not going to be comfortable . The wideness does help with the balance of it for a child that would be pushing it but the handle popping off kind of defeats that purpose .	-1
That person 's right . The name Kianna is from a Bratz doll . There 's a Fianna AND a Kianna . This doll 's great but maybe they should change her name ...	-1
They are obviously running out of new ideas for Elmo . This Elmo is obnoxious and quite frankly a little scary . We played with him in the store and he fell out of the shelf on top of my daughter while vigorously waving his arms . She is a big fan of Elmo , but DID NOT like this one . We could not even get him to stop- he was already not working properly . Get Check-Up Elmo- he is much better !	-1
We found this dollhouse used at a really reasonable price . It 's massive : the perfect size to accommodate my kids ' Playmobil people and furniture , and it 's actually pretty attractive . The plastic it 's made of seems fairly rigid , and so I 'd just assumed it must be something like ABS -the stuff Playmobil and Legos are made out of - and a relatively stable plastic.A few days after setting it up in my daughter 's room , I started to notice an odd burning plastic smell . I did n't immediately pin the dollhouse as the culprit , but when I directly smelled the dollhouse I realized it was the source . ABS , for the record , has no smell , and so immediately I began to suspect it was n't made of ABS ... so then what is it made of ? There are no recycling codes on the bottom of the dollhouse , so I opted to call Fisher Price , who told me in a very friendly , professional manner that their plastics are 'proprietary ' but that most things they make of this sort are made of PVC . Huh ? An entire dollhouse made of PVC when there are so many better , safer materials with which to make an object this large ? PVC is the most toxic plastic out there . From production to use to disposal , it poisons people , and the environment , creating health complications from asthma , cancer , immunological dysfunction , and hormone disruption.I suppose if these health issues seem par for the course , you 'd be as happy with this dollhouse as any other out there . It 's a lovely and alluring piece of toxic garbage , and it 's certainly taught me a valuable lesson about assuming the best of companies who 've not earned that kind of trust . Shame on you Mattel .	-1
The guns were very nice looking ... .I bought three ; however , I could n't find the caps anywhere except one brand online and they were expensive compared to the 8 cap rings that can be purchased for $ 1 a big pack at Dollar General . Amazon was good to give me a refund right away .	-1
I bought this for my 4 and 6 year olds for Christmas thinking it would be really cute . They wanted them desperately . After opening it they were both really disappointed . My 6 year old asked if she could exchange it for something else . You have to press really hard to get the pony to make the sucking sounds with the bottle , it frustrated them both . I really thought it would do more ! It only has a couple of sayings and it just does n't interact much at all . I think for the price it was a rip off I ca n't believe it cost so much I truly expected more than this . I strongly recommend the Fur Real Friends toys they do so much for the same price my kids LOVE them .	-1
Can I start out by saying `` I wish Hasbro would start making toys like they used to ! '' This toy has performed simular to the quality of the MLP Castle , MLP Butterfly Island and MLP Dance Studio ... .the fun does not last before it breaks , if it ever performs at all . My daughter loves the MLP line but other then the ponies themselves the toys are made of very poor quality . This pony was at the top of our daughters list after seeing the commercials . She received it on Christmas Eve and we still can not get the doll to work correctly . She has never slept or woken up from patting her back or drank from her bottle . We 've tried everything , no luck . My suggestion , if your children like this line , stick to the individual ponies and save your money.UPDATE : IT FINALLY WORKS ! Knock on wood ! We turned it off and after two days I turned it back on and `` It finally works '' She does everything she is suppose to and is actually very adorable . The next hope is that it continues to work so we are not throwing away the box just yet . So if anyone out there with a heart broken daughter is frustrated with this toy try turning it off for a couple of days and turning it back on ... .I do n't understand why but It worked for us . Good luck	-1
If you already have a house full of plastic toys , you will probably love this . It 's bright , it 's big , it 's quickly assembled and quickly broken . My kids got this as a gift , played with it for a couple of days , and then went back outside to the swingset , the bubbles , the sidewalk chalk , and other more active diversions .	-1
I am very disappointed in the durability of this doll . The dress IS verrrry beautiful , although the `` reversible '' feature is sort of useless ( my 6 year old could not figure out how to reattach the velcro after spinning dress around . The other dress is not quite as pretty anyway ) . But after only a month or so of gentle play , one of her legs is dangling out of its socket . I 'm embarrassed to admit my daughter has roughly 25 Barbie dolls ( many were second hand and very inexpensive though ! ) , and this is the only one that has broken a joint . Perhaps they cut corners on the doll in order to use the more elaborate fabric on the dress ? The doll was not inexpensive , so I expected it to last longer !	-1
I went out looking for this type of toy for my daughter so that she would learn to manipulate things . I found this at multiple stores ; however , I did n't buy it because the Ernie button did n't work well . As an adult , I had great difficulty making it pop open . My 10 month old daughter certainly would n't be able to do it . Again , I 've been to 3 different stores and all of this toy that I 've tried did n't Ernie work well . I 'm not sure if they had a bad batch , bu I did n't get it because 25 % of the toy was unusable for my daughter .	-1
MY SCENE LOVERS NEED TO STOP HATING ON BRATZ.THESE DOLLS ARE AN EXAMPLE OF CHEAP PIECES OF CRAP ! THEIR HEADS POP OFF AND THEY COPPIED OFF BRATZ ! !	-1
I 've played dozens of party games , and usually the louder we can get then the better the game , but this game was just sheer madness . When reading the rules it seems rather simplistic and fun , but in actual application it was horrible.With a group of up to eight players everyone gets a `` subject card '' . The subject can be boys names , actors , things found in a dentist office , etc . Each player keeps his subject to himself . Then a `` letter card '' is turned face up . At that point the first person to 1 . ) put down his subject card 2 . ) read the subject aloud & 3 . ) say a word that begins with the letter shown and is applicable to his subject ( e.g . the letter is `` O '' , `` boys name : Otis ! `` ) , then his subject is the subject for the entire group . Immediately after shouting out your subject and word that begins with the visible letter , you have to hit the random timer and the race is on for everyone to say the last word.I 'll tell you how the game really went : '' The letter is 'B ' '' . '' Blalalalalalalalah ! ! ! ! ! ! ! '' & lt ; someone then hits the timer > '' No , '' '' What ? `` `` I was first ! `` `` Who said you can hit the timer ? `` `` You 're cheating ! `` `` My subject is too long , I could n't say it faster than you ! `` `` I did n't hear anything but yelling . `` `` Just because you were loudest does n't mean you were first . `` `` OK , this game is terrible , lets pack it up . `` With eight people yelling at once and all eight people believing that they were first , we got nowhere . We actually had to modify the game just so it was playable . We just selected subject cards and then flipped over a letter card and went from there .	-1
it 's a sound puzzle but there was no sound . I gave this as a gift to my 2yo niece . There was no sound because the battery was dead .	-1
Let me preface this review by saying that I am an extremely handy guy , having assembled countless toys , furniture and other construction projects . I 've done a gut renovation on a bathroom and hung crown molding . My review should not be read as `` I know what I am doing and wont have the same problems as that person . `` Very few of the holes aligned to assemble the frame structure . The only way to do it is to attach the bolts loosely and `` bend '' the wood into place - then tighten everything down.The clock hands could not be attached with the supplied hardware . I was given two male parts , not a male and a female . I threw them both out and used a spare nut and bolt with a few washers.The sign on the top could not be properly attached with the two brass-colored fittings . Two problems there - First , the holes in the cross bar were so large the nut side of the assembly simply pulled through . Second , the tube part of the bolt ( it 's an odd hardware design ) was too long to secure the nut tightly . In the end , I went back into my hardware bag of extra odds and ends and found a bunch of old black washers that fit to keep the bolt from pulling through the hole and that allowed me to tighten the nuts properly.Once assembled , this is a great toy . My daughter has lots of fun . The chalk board works pretty well , but you need a wet rag to really get it clean . Two kids easily fit inside.I can not , however , recommend this because the assembly is simply terrible . You need to have a lot of extra parts and know-how to get this assembled properly .	-1
This was cute and easy setup but was broken within the month . Wish it had held up . Cute idea though	-1
This charger never worked , not only was it difficult to put onto the charger once you thought you had it on , it really was n't on . There is a light that indicates when it is on properly , but once you got it on it would always pop off and then you would have to wrestle with it to get it back on . THen it never held a charge on a brand new system . It would turn off right in the middle of a game or not at all . Very frustrating for a 5 year old . I just threw mine out because all it was doing was taking up space . Save your money and get a car plug in or just use the outlet plug.NEVER WORKED .	-1
After several days of trying and trying to get this thing to work , we 've given up and will have to return it . The only way it would charge in the beginning was if we held down the console with our hands ( naturally , that 's not something I 'm willing to stand there and do for several hours ) . The console is n't heavy enough at the bottom to push down on the button that activates charging . We 'll try exchanging it for another one , but if the second one is just as bad , we 'll have to go back to batteries . That will get expensive since my kids love their V Smile and play it so much I 've had to put new batteries in twice a week !	-1
Maybe my kids are just weird , but we got this for Christmas and it was played with once by my 5 year old and then never again . I checked it out to see if it was educational and it is , but my kids just do n't seem to be fixated on video game systems like so many other kids are . It 's pretty pricey , thankfully , I did n't pay for it . I just feel that some kids can learn better if you sit down with them and go through workbooks . I mean really do we need another gaming system that really only acts as a temporary babysitter . My kids get bored with video games very fast . Their new thing is using their imagination to ward off godzilla . Who knew that with all the toys out there they would rather play pretend .	-1
We have the original V-Smile console that hooks to the TV and the boys love it ! We decided to buy the v-smile pocket so they could play anywhere . The screen was blurry when the games were moving . We also had trouble with the system freezing up frequently . We would have to push the reset button on the back to un-freeze it . This is frustrating when in the middle of a game because then you have to start over . We returned ours and luckily got a full refund from the store we purchased it from . While we love the original V-smile , I would recomend the leapster handheld ( from Leapfrog ) over the V-smile pocket . We have had no issues with the leapster system .	-1
My child loves his leapster , but he wanted a Scooby Doo game and Leapster does n't have one . After reading the other reviews here , I decided to get him a V-Smile for his birthday . What a big waste of money ! ! ! The V-Smile games are not intuitive at all like the Leapster games . The controls on the game unit do n't work well either - I 'll have to buy a joystick if he wants to spend anytime playing this . The graphics on the V-Smile screen are OK , but when displayed on the TV , they are really low-quality and it is difficult to make out individual letters or read words because they are so blurry.I was also disapointed in the quality of the games . No wonder V-Smile stuff is cheaper than Leapster stuff - you get what you pay for . I did n't find the content of the games all that educational and while my son has to read or add in order to play , he does n't learn anything . To play V-Smile you have to already know the answer . Leapster allows the child to play games and not know the answers , with Leapster children learn while they play . V-Smile is more of a test : you know or you lose . Not fun at all.I regret wasting so much money on this toy . I wish I had just bought more games for his Leapster .	-1
Our three year old loves his Shake and Go cars , so the Raceway seemed like a no-brainer for Christmas . Unfortunately , this playset just does n't live up to its promise and as a result , it 's already collecting dust while the more engaging toys ( Geotrax trains ) get all of the attention . Now , every child 's tastes are different , but I can really see his point in this case.The cars themselves are battery-operated and you rev them up by simply shaking them . This is great for younger kids because it eliminates the hassle , mess ( cords ) and risk of electricity . The longer you shake , the farther/faster they 'll go - just set them down on the floor and they 're off . The Raceway guides them along an oval track , tallying how many laps each car has completed and even which car is in the lead . The critical flaw here is that with just their own internal power to go on , the cars only race for a few short laps before your child has to pick them up and repeat it . Also , it 's very likely that one car will konk out before the other one does and since the track is configured for the cars to switch lanes each lap , this means that rear-end collisions are inevitable . These collisions are loud , they potentially damage the cars and could even pinch your child 's fingers if he/she is n't careful when reaching out for the stopped car.Even without any collisions , the Raceway is possibly the loudest toy we 've ever owned . The squealing-and-clacking noise that the wheels make on the tracks is unfortunately so loud that it drowns out the cool engine sounds of the car themselves . The Raceway has a nifty finish line that announces who 's in the lead and how many laps are left , but it 's useless since ( 1 ) the track noise drowns it out and ( 2 ) the cars ca n't possibly finish an entire 10-lap race.Simply put , the Raceway actually limits how much fun your child can have with Shake and Go cars . We enjoy them so much more out in the open - racing across the floor and driving around ( and through ) obstacles that we devise out of household objects . The Shake and Go Raceway is a great product idea , but its poor design completely stifles that idea . As others have accurately stated , just get the cars and avoid this waste of space and money.PROS* Sturdy construction and quick , easy assembly* The cars themselves are a great toy - kids love shaking them , the real sounds that they make and the way they take offCONS* Self-powered cars need to be continuously recharged mid-race* Exceedingly loud even when the cars are n't crashing into each other	-1
This was a gift . I would not have bought it now that it has been here for months with little use . The kids just are not interested in it . The balls with different textures are a great idea but the holes are too small so the balls often get stuck . Another reviewer complained about the head coming off easily . I agree but that has not happened in my house since no one is really interested in this toy . Aside from boring and defective , the music is awful . This one is a dud ... do n't bother .	-1
My 22 month old had put his foot into the bottom right opening on the dinosaur 4 times in the last 2 days . His entire foot has been stuck . He is unable to remove his foot out of the hole . It has taken both of his parents working together for several minutes to extract his foot out of the hole . He became very upset and slight bruising to his ankle area where he has tried to remove his foot from the toy .	-1
Our son got this toy when he was 6mths old and still at 12 mths he could care less about it . In fact the only use it gets is him crawling on it to get to something out of reach . He has played with it a few times but only because we were sitting right there playing with it with him.The balls get stuck in the middle hole and our son likes the sound and lights and all he does it stick his finger in the hole and make the sound and lights go off without the ball.Out of 6 mths he has maybe played with it five times ( again because we were playing with it to get him to play with it ) for about 2 minutes . Glad we did n't waste our money on it , instead it was a gift .	-1
For many babies 9 months old and older ( as Fisher-Price recommends on the box ) , this 'Learning Car ' is downright dangerous and can spell disaster . Our 10 month old daughter has been standing and 'cruising ' now for months , yet when she grabs onto the handle of this product , it moves from underneath her way too quickly ( or just flips over ! ) , and she falls hard to the ground ! Even flat on her face at times ! If your baby has control over this aspect ( i.e . OLDER babies , or developmentally advanced ones ) , the product should be fine . BUT , if not , as is the case with many younger babies at the incipient stages of walking , this product can hurt your infant . The wheels should have some resistance built into them , so that the product does not roll out quickly from underneath the infant . BUYER BEWARE ! ! ! !	-1
My 10 month old daughter loved this toy , but then I found something in her mouth . It was the black and white sticker that has the smile on the front of the walker . I had only turned away from my child for a moment , and I was totally shocked when I realized what was actually in her mouth . When I looked closer at the toy I realized that & # 8216 ; The Abc & # 8217 ; s under the lights , the eyes and the smile on the front of the car & # 8217 ; are all stickers that are put on by the manufacturer . I was so surprised on how easily these pealed off . I had only had the toy for a few weeks . My child liked to ride on it , but I was afraid that the other stickers would come off on it so I ended up returning the product .	-1
What a disappointment ! We wanted this to encourage our 11-month old to cruise . Well , it made her stand up , but once she was standing , there was nothing for her to do . The toys that attach to the top are little better than those on her old , outgrown exersaucer . There are no activities on the top of the panels , nothing educational or even anything that captures her interest . The only interactive pieces are at the bottom , and these are well below her developmental level . A waste of space , we much prefer her learning table , and may get the Leapfrog Learn-Arounbd Playground , which she enjoyed at a friend 's house .	-1
Bought this for my 3 year old - who loves to entertain w. singing and dancing . He was not at all interested . Really disappointed . The video and sound quality on this thing is terrible . Comes out really dark and blurry on your TV . The microphone is bad too - poor design and sound quality . Do n't waste your money .	-1
Both our kids love watching home videos of themselves and they also recently started to sing their favorite songs using home made mics , so we came across this toy at a local box store and thought it would be the perfect Santa gift ! It 's very easy to plug in and start using , but with fresh batteries one of the mics stopped working in under 20 seconds . It also gives off a horrible buzz in the speakers ... and you have to have the volume turned all the way up on the base station for the music to be heard . Also ... with HDTV being the standard these days , why market a product that has less than great `` standard def '' quality ? That does n't make any sense . With toys like the Wii and X-box , this toy is very sub-standard ! A complete waste of $ 50.00 ! Do NOT waste your money ! !	-1
Oh my , I am so dissappointed . I thought this would be a perfect gift for my daughter who like to sing dance and especially loves watching herself on our video camera . First of all , it runs on batteries only , does n't plug in so make sure you have turned everything off , even though its not plugged into the t.v . it can still drain batteries , turn off both the microphone and the control box . and put it up so the kids ca n't play with it and accidentally turn it on . Second of all , The micro phone does n't make any noise unless its in your mouth , yuk ! ! ! ! ! Your mouth literally has to be over the piece . definitely not hygenic if you have multiple people playing . My daughter seemed confused that she needed the microphone in her mouth to here anything ( not much ) Confused because I always seem to tell her , yuck do n't put things in your mouth . No spit here , Thank You . 1 Star because she can see her self dance to the music .	-1
When I first received the Crazy Legs bug , I thought it was great ... colorful and clever . I loved that the shapes were attached so that you could never lose a piece . As my little guy got older , I released the string from the compartment that hid it so that he could use the string to pull the toy . Shortly thereafter , I learned a lesson ... this is not a toy that you would ever want to leave your child alone with when the string is out of the compartment that hides it . Right before my eyes , my little guy rolled over twice and wrapped the string around his neck . It scared him and it scared me . Thankfully , it happened while I was in the room ... I ca n't imagine what could 've happened if I 'd walked out of the room for even 30 seconds.I was happy the toy had a string , but even before he wrapped it around his neck , I was surprised at the length . It 's 27 inches and can stretch to 29 inches . Other toy companies ' toys have strings so short that you can barely use the string or the part of the toy attached to the string.I 'd recommend that if you 're going to purchase this toy , either do n't use the string , or clip the sting to a length that makes it impossible for your child to wrap the string around his/her neck . If it were n't for the string , I 'd be giving this toy a high rating .	-1
Someone offered this toy to my daughter about 1.5 years ago . She started to get a real interest in it around 18mo ( before , she would just try to make it sing some songs ) . At that point , the toy broke -after little use- and would loop repeat an annoying music.Amazon had a great policy and exchanged it for free.The updated version does not have the links to the shapes . So the shapes got inevitably lost . The fun part of succeeding then pushing on the ladybug to free the shapes has been completely lost . So she lost interest very quickly although she was so happy to see we got a new working one . I felt so sad for her ...	-1
I bought this toy a few days ago for my one year old son and just finished repackaging it to return it to the store . We gave it a good try for a few days ( I 'd rather keep a toy that atleast has some potential than return it ) , but it was just too frustrating.It seems they were trying to do too much with this toy . Is it a pull toy , cause/effect toy , or a shape sorter ? Well it does n't do any of those things well . It does n't roll well , the buttons are hard to push ( probably in part because it is on wheels , but also even if you push the buttons all the way , it may or may not activate it ) , and the shapes come out when the wheels roll or the top button is pushed - accompanied by an annoying `` WHOOPS ! '' . Part of the programming , but the `` WHOOPS '' & `` shape-sorter '' song is too frequent , seemingly random ( you ca n't cut off the song with the push of a button ) and very annoying . I thought maybe my son just needs to be a little older ( he loves cause & effect devices & toys ( remote controls , push button phones , dvd player , etc ) , but the `` effect '' part of this toy is way too inconsistent . I think the most enjoyment he got from this toy was picking it up and tossing it.I gave this toy two stars for the cute design & good quality - it 's very solid & well made , but it is too annoying & I think you 're better off buying some other toy ( s ) instead for your little one .	-1
For my son this was an over-complicated and exceedingly annoying pull toy . That 's all he ever used it for . A couple of months ago the battery cover and batteries disappeared at some point . This was very odd since we keep tings tidy and do n't lose the little pieces to almost any toy . Especially ones that need a screwdriver to be removed . I may have removed it and thrown it out the window in the middle of the night while sleep walking in a desperate attempt to eliminate the evil sorting song from my life forever . I should have noticed that the song stopped and life was brighter , but I can still hear it in the back of my mind . Sometimes I hum it in the shower . It sticks with you forever ... you 'll never forget it ... I 'm warning you now . Do n't let it into your home.I came online looking for a replacement battery cover . After all , my son is now 2 1/2 and perhaps now he can get the unnecessarily complex shaped pieces to stay in their delicate holsters and use this toy for that which it is intended . But sadly , the Vtech website says they 're out of stock . Then I checked out Amazon and came across this product page , noticed the 2 star rating and was comforted to see that I 'm not the only soul tormented by the sorting song that has come to this planet to destroy civilizations and implode the sun . Then I thought , `` What on earth am I doing ? ? ? '' and threw the stupid bug with it 's stupid baby in the trash outside of the house where I never have to look at it again and am finally free of the catchy and pervasive chanting . YES ! ! ! ! Sort , sort , sort my shapes ... whoops !	-1
This toy is obnoxious , uninteresting to my child , and a nuisance to our household ! And yet we got gifted with it TWICE . We never asked for this toy , but we got one for my daughter 's 1st birthday a year ago , and then another 6 months later for Christmas . Thaaaaanks.My daughter is two now and has never found this toy fun or interesting . The songs & words it sings are hard to understand , the buttons and legs are difficult for her to understand , it 's bulky , and loud . Because of it 's design , it 's always on the floor , and my daughter leaves it in various areas . I ca n't tell you how many times I have accidentally tripped over it or knocked into it with something - each time it starts blasting , `` SORT SORT SORT MY SHAPES , CIRCLES , HEARTS , AND SQUARES ! ! ! ! '' - sometimes waking my napping daughter up and sometimes tempting me to pick it up and throw it through a window.It looks like a clever , unique toy , but once you get it home it really is just a nuisance you ca n't wait to be rid of .	-1
We received this for a gift . What a waste of money ; please save yours and buy something else . The picture has a pull string , well ours did n't come with one . The main issue for me is that shapes ... since they do n't fit securely in the toy , they are just asking to get lost . The shapes do n't `` stick '' in the shape spots very good , I 'm always looking for something to grab on the toy to hold it steady so my daughter can pop them on , but i always grad the thing on top , which makes all the shapes pop out . Ugh . There are way better shape sorters out there -- check out tolo and battat . Forget this one .	-1
My son got this toy for his 1st birthday ( he is now 18 months ) . He does enjoy playing with it because it sings and he dances to the music . However , this toy is confusing because it does too many things at once . If you push the top down , all the shapes pop off and she asks to help find the shapes . If you put the square back into the square , it says `` square . '' That is , if the toy does n't roll at all . Every time it rolls it starts singing `` come along , let 's play along , let 's take a learning journey ... '' So , the learning experience is actually over . I have tried to play with it and can not manage to put all the shapes in without it starting some other annoying song . It also has a lot of buttons and each one does a separate thing . My son ends up getting overstimulated and throwing the toy .	-1
My 9 month old received when he was 5 months . It is not entertaining at all . My 2 year tried it out and was easily bored . Did last five minutes with the toy . The String is too short to pull on it . It not educational or exciting and it 's annoying . My husband and I did not see the point of this toy we returned it within two days of receiving it.There is no value in having this toy . Neither one of my boys were interested in the toy .	-1
My daughters ( three and one years old ) received this as a gift from their grandmother , and while I appreciate the thought this toy had to be the most useless waste of money that has ever been spent on them . Even with the volume at it 's highest setting you can barely hear the voice , making it 's educational value null , and the since the shapes stick into the side of the bug rather loosely they 're constantly falling off and becoming lost . My daughters played with this a combined total of about ten minutes before it was thrown into the toy box abyss , and after six months has now made it 's way to the donation pile . Vtech makes many awesome toys- this was just not one of them.For infants and young toddlers , we recommend the Vtech Sit to Stand Learning Walker- it has survived four years in our household and is still holding up strong for baby number three . Well worth the money !	-1
We got this as a gift when my child was around 2 , so 2013 . It lasted about one month of non heavy use , and the music stopped playing , which then you really ca n't play with it anymore . You can push the shapes in and hit the lady bug to make the shapes pop out but that is about it . My husband took the whole thing apart thinking a wire was loose , and he could not figure out why it does n't play music . I have put new batteries in , turned on and off , nothing . No sound . So we got about 1 month use out of it . During that month I will say the music was way too loud . Now that it is gone though , there is no purpose , because everything you push or move plays a song or has instructions . Otherwise it is cute and sturdy . Wish it worked . I have to add too , my kids are NOT rough on toys , we have had many that look brand new after 3-4 years off play , so it was n't how it was played with . I have heard that company made a new version without the attached shapes , so maybe the music breaking will work again ( seems to be common complaint at vtech ) but I would not risk buying the version that is advertised currently with the attached shapes .	-1
Most . Annoying . Toy . Ever.My son is 10 months old , and I bought this toy and gave it to him about a month ago . I was immediately sorry . When you turn it on , it automatically sings this song super loudly about sorting shapes to the tune of `` Row , Row , Row Your Boat , '' then sings it AGAIN before asking you to `` follow '' it in doing something or other . It is the most annoying song known to man , sung in the most annoying way possible . I know I 'm overusing the word `` annoying , '' but there is just no other way to describe it.Granted , my son is too young to really do any of the things you are supposed to do with it , but when he hits the bug on top , all it does is say , `` Uh oh , '' then repeats what it wants you to do and sometimes even sings that awful song again.So I shut the sound off . He does like to play with it without the sound on , but the switch turns on so easily that occasionally he turns the sound on , and I die a little inside . I really should just take the batteries out.Also , the toy at one point yells out in a kid 's voice , `` Let 's sing , Mommy '' in the most annoying way possible . I find it somewhat insulting that only `` Mommy '' could be playing with this toy with her child . What about Daddy ? Or Grandma ? This is not an equal-opportunity toy , I daresay.Perhaps the sound on mine is messed up , but it 's really hard to hear what it is they want you to do on each mode . ( Trust me , I do not have hearing problems . ) I even tried to figure out the tasks , but the toy would tell me I messed up and sing the stupid shapes-sorting song again , which did not help matters . I think this would be difficult and frustrating for a young child.Maybe I can re-evaluate this toy when my son is older , but when I think about his older cousins , it seems that by the time he 's old enough to play with it , this toy wo n't hold his interest for very long . I may also have buried it in the backyard and sprinkled it with holy water by then , anyhow . Thank God I bought it used and did n't pay very much for it !	-1
My daughter received this as a 1st birthday present . She is totally uninterested in it . I keep it out , just in case she changes her mind , but so far it is a fail . Save your $ .	-1
My daughter got this for her birthday . She does n't even play with the fish . She likes the blocks , though , so we 've put them in her other block toy and she plays with them.The blocks are too big for the fish and they do n't come out easily . It 's just not a fun toy .	-1
I was out one day shopping for age appropriate toys for my 8 month old and saw this . I bought it since it has the peek a blocks that my son enjoys from his other toys.The only thing about this toy that my son likes is the blocks . The fish itself does n't hold his attention . He stops and listens to the music , but other than that he is not interested . It comes with 4 blocks but only 3 really fits inside the fish . The fact that you have to press on the fish to make the mouth open and release the blocks is a little too advanced for an 8 month old , let along for 6 months , which is the age this toy is rated for.My son is now 10 months and still ignores the fish.If you want a toy that will hold your child 's attention , I would pass by this one and keep looking .	-1
Our 13 month old son recieved this for a gift for his first birthday . He has n't played with it once and he is a very very busy boy playing all day long . I would not recomend this toy .	-1
Lindsay Lohan ; one of the pop industries biggest sluts , and what does Mattell do ? Make a doll out of her.I truly find this pathetic ... I mean what 's next a Britney Spears my scene ? Everybody says the Bratz are `` whores '' and `` sluts '' , but I 've seen some really trampy my scene dolls too ( this one included ; also the Masquerade Madness Dream Genie Delancy ; her clothes are see through and her entire mid-drift is showing ) .To sum it up , if Bratz are tramps , so is my scene ... I mean come on people , My Scene copied Bratz and they wear similar clothes ! If Bratz are sluts , the My Scene girls are too !	-1
Normally I would like my scene dolls , but this doll is SCARY ! ! ! ! She has the ugliest , geekiest face I have ever seen . And this is part of the terrible trend to market celebrity dolls to young children . We do n't need girls trying to be like Lohan at the age of 5 .	-1
If the Crypt Keeper and Ann Margret had a kid together , it would be this doll . Lindsay Lohan has an interesting charisma that this doll just does n't capture . The epxression is grating and smug , and the eyes are lifeless ( this goes for all the dolls , they were made this way and it will take more than a small change to fix that . ) The doll looks too old , and it has an over-botoxed look . I 'm not feeling it , it 's scary-looking.The outfit is very cute , but the doll looks like a hag . I 'm sorry , but it 's true.Erm , that is all.CHOW ! And do n't touch the sushi.XOXOXO , Roxanne [ ... ]	-1
look how bad you made lindsay look with this stupid piece of trash . it is not beautiful , nor a good example . this right here is an example of trashing a beautiful celebrity . take this stupid thing a put it in the trash ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! !	-1
THIS IS AN EXAMPLE OF A POORLY MADE VERSION OF THE BRATZ LATE NIGHT LIMO.EXCEPT WITH THE MY SCENE DOLLS THEY ARE TEACHING LITTLE INNOCENT GIRLS TO DRINK ! NEXT TIME , MY SCENE WILL BE TEACHING GIRLS TO DO DRUGS ! AND NEXT TIME , THINK OF A NEW IDEA !	-1
My daughter HAD to have this for Christmas . Now that she has it , she has played with it for about 5 minutes . Unfortunately , the wings do not stay on and the Barbie has a hard time staying on as well . The packaging was well done , unfortunately they hooked my 4 year old who convinced Santa to get it . I would not recommend this toy .	-1
This is a really terrible product . It will not stay up and stable and keeps collapsing on itself . I read the instructions to see if I was missing something and it said that some versions of this product come with a support pole and some do not . Mine did n't and the thing wo n't stand up . It 's also nearly impossible to fold it back into the size of the box it came in.I have fiddled and fiddled with trying ( following the directions ) to twist some of the wires in a certain way to try to get it to be a little more stable , to no avail.I really wish I still had the receipt for this thing so I could return it , but unfortunately I did n't keep it , so the next destination is ... the trash .	-1
I ca n't believe that for $ 19.99 , this is all you get in the package . What a waste of money ! Plus , the CD does n't even work - you ca n't use a mini-CD in any front-loading CD player . Plus , what 's up with the skunk streaks in her hair ? I would never buy this doll for my daughter - not only is her look way too skanky , but there 's barbed wire on the front of the package ! Can we say completely age-inappropriate ? ? There is no value in the product ( and it does n't even work ) . Do n't waste your money ! I 've heard that the My Scene dolls are coming out with a new movie that 's supposed to rival this `` Rock Angels '' theme - and supposedly it 's supposed to be much higher quality and way more age-appropriate for girls . The word on the street with my circle of friends with daughters in the 8-12 age group is that it 's definitely the more wholesome , age-appropriate toy & movie choice this fall . After hearing that , I can tell you where I plan to spend my money - especially after seeing this ( and my past disappointments with the quality of Bratz 's products and their toys ' inappopriateness ) .	-1
This theme makes no sense to me - not only are the dolls ugly , dark , and completely un-girl friendly , but tying in with a goth theme ? Girls do n't understand goth or what it stands for - do you really want your kids playing with a theme that reeks of `` daughters of darkness '' and all that it stands for ? I ca n't imagine buying a goth doll for my daughter , nor can I understand why anyone would . How much more inappropriate can these dolls get ?	-1
Why make a goth doll 4 girls ? The desciption on the box made it sound like they were going to summon a demon though dancing . Plus they have evil , murderous looks on their faces ... Not something for little girls .	-1
THIS IS THE UGLY YASMIN EVER I MEAN THE HAIR N THE CLOTHES THEY ALL SUCK I DONT RECOMMED THIS BRATZ LINE GET SOMETHING ESL LIKE THE PRICESS LINE	-1
THIS IS NOT YASMIN YASMIN IS TANNED AND NOT PAIL AND HAS TANBROWN HAIR NOT BLACK AND BLUE THIS IS A CHEAT IT IS JADE GET OVER IT .	-1

I like Bratz . My favorite are Fiana , Jade , and Phoebe . I liked Phoebe because I thought she dressed like me and that her personality was like mine . I was stunned by Bratz Treasures and Bratz Wild Wild West . Bratz camp Fire made me think otherwise . If they are wearing such large jackets and the name is camp fire , then I 'm guessing it 's really cold . Yet just like in wintertime wonderland , they are wearing skirts . I think this collection does n't have good colors . They either have dark and ugly colors on or many different bright colors on . I do n't like Phoebe 's new hair color at all . I think this collection of dolls and the dolls cartoon pictures are bad . Buy a different kind of Bratz , but not this one . There are way better ones out there .	-1
Once again , the Bratz prove to be just as outdoorsy as any other doll . Just as long as they have their designer canteens on hand , not to mention their oh so useful-in-the-wilderness stilleto boots . At least when Barbie goes camping she does it practically . Do you see Barbie prancing around the campfire in a mini skirt and bare midriff ? And then acting surprised when she finds out that the mosquitoes have bitten her all to hell ? I think not.That 's all I have to say . Once they release the Bratz Camp Fire Woodsy Vanity and the Plush Bratz Camp Fire Tent complete with manicure station , shoe rack and deluxe bathroom , then you can expect more reviews from me . I think what the Bratz really need is the Bratz Camp Fire Burn Ward and Intensive Care for Insect Bites Center . Now that 's something that would come in useful AND teach your kid to not be the skanky extra in one of those bad forest horror movies.The Raven ( strikes again ! )	-1
This is a misleading double entry -- buy from the main product page instead ( I am assuming that the page was created in good faith and not in an attempt to actively mislead customers , but it is a higher-priced duplicate page at time of this writing ) .The main product page is atMelissa & Doug See & Spell . Compare prices and judge for yourself .	-1
I returned this . I was really excited for this - thought it would be perfect for my son ( who loves to play these sort of puzzles on my iPad - where he puts the matching letter on top of the block for it in a word-spelling game ) .The letters do n't fit - the S in mine had to be wedged in ( I did n't try all the letters , but I tested multiple S pieces on multiple puzzles & it had to be wedged on all of them ... which makes sense seeing as these are all machined using the same parameters ) .The boards are also very very thin ... nothing like any other Melissa & Doug product we have .	-1
I am a big fan of Melissa & Doug toys/products but this one was not a hit in my household . While I like the idea which is the reason I bought it , here are some negatives that I see : - Depending on the age of the child ( mine was 3 when using it ) , it 's easy to associate the picture on the & # 34 ; card & # 34 ; with the word being spelled . So , it does n't really aid in reading or spelling.- The letter pieces are small and can be cumbersome to take care of.- There is no box for the letters , no cover for them either . This can be super annoying since they have a tendency to make a mess- It keeps the interest of my kids for a mere 5-7minutes . Not long enough !	-1
This was the one thing that my daughter really wanted from Santa for Christmas . Months later , it sits in the corner of her room and is used once or twice a month . It 's not very stimulating and after a few minutes of play , she loses interest . It also tips very easily so we 've had to prop it against a wall to keep it from falling over . The volume is also very loud but that 's no longer an issue since I taped over the speaker . Cinderella appearing in the mirror is a nice touch , however , an adult needs to position and push the key in forcefully for her to appear . Quite difficult for a child to do . I wish I had saved my money on this one and purchased a nice wooden vanity instead .	-1
For the money we paid it is cheaply made.Xmas eve as we were putting it together we NEVER got the light up parts to work AT ALL . WE yanked out the mirror many times , tried EVERYTHING to push it more firmly together but ALAS no light ups or cinderella : ( .Knowing our daughter would still enjoy the talking part it was left out for Xmas half working.She does THOUGHLY enjoy it , and talks back to cinderella a lot.Loves to interact with all the pieces that salvaged it a star IMO . I konw even with the bugs we hate about it she will enjoy the toy a lot.My Husband had to pull apart the mirror take it to his workshop to try & make it work . When I say pull it apart I mean literally take the back off the assembled mirror and sanded the plastic connector down to make a better fit ! Even now only cinderella lights up . At one point we had lights and conderella but that stopped after it was bumped . then it went on when pressed down . But lost it and decided to suck it up and just celebrate our victory of finally reliably seeing cinderella . He was paifully disappointed in the cheaply made and crappy conection used for what `` makes '' this toy . It isnt hard to make an easier and better connecting system . I got this on sale , not a big sale and it is NOT worth the money . They need to go back to the drawing board and make it a bit sturdier and a DECENT easy connection for reliable function .	-1
We bought this for my huge infant because he reached the weight limit of his other movement toys and this could be used at nine months . We think it was a waste of money . It does n't bounce well . It slides all over the place . He fell out of it more than once . The restraint really works best for smaller kids . At 9months he had really reached the limit and it pinched his thighs.We sold it after a few months even though I am pregnant with our second . Not worth the storage space .	-1
You have to wait till it makes its monkey noise to tap it on the head and get it to walk . By then its been flung around and on its back somewhere with wheels spinning in the air . Also if you have little kids , there are toys laying around . If it hits a toy , it knocks over and your back to my previous point . My 1yr old son does not find it very interesting .	-1
This was a total waste of money . It had such rave reviews I thought it was a must have for my then 9 month old to have to encourage crawling . This thing basically moves a few inches in one direction , turns and moves a few more inches . The only redeeming quality it the cute monkey noises it makes ( although some might find those annoying . ) It 's not very sturdy , and falls over easily .	-1
we were just at Toys r us ; a fisher price representative was there showing this toy . My three yr old was so excited to see it out and put together and was anxious to play w/it . It kept falling apart , he was barely touching it when the whole top toppled down and fell completely apart . The fisher price rep. said , you have to be careful w/it ! She was frowning as if it were my son 's fault . It is for 4 yr olds , my son is two months from 4 , yet you must be careful w/it ? ? ? ? The idea is really cool , and my son loved it if it would have stayed together . There is a part where you flip the boulder out of a plastic cup , this part kept coming off and the rep was putting it back together with lots of pressure , more pressure than a 4 yr old has . The way it is designed is not condusive to 4 yr old boy play . I was also not impressed w/the fisher price representatives lack of patience with children playing with this toy , as my son and others were playing with it and it kept falling apart as she is trying to keep it from falling completely apart and trying to grab falling parts . I would not recommend this toy . This is not a toy a child can play with without an adult there constantly to reassemble it and I mean constantly to grab the falling parts and keeping it from completely coming apart .	-1
Although this toy states for 4-8 year olds , I think it would work best for the higher end of this spectrum . Getting this Mountain together took some work and although I like that idea of being able to rearrange and reconfigure it however you want , this choice leaves the entire piece unstable . TIP : place this on a table for play since we 've found leaving it on the floor leads to it falling apart more easily when played with by the kids . I have a 4 yo son and he ends up frustrated by the way it easily falls apart but when we try to put it away , he gets upset because he really likes playing with it ... ... .so parents beware . Also , some of the pieces are very poorly designed ( the falling palm tree rarely works and the boulder thrower does not work without breaking off ) and the decoration pieces ( fences & bushes ) constantly fall off . This toy is equally frustrating for both parents and children . But my son seems to love it no matter how frustrating it gets and the related dinosaur pieces are great .	-1
I really hate this toy . I bought it at ToysRUs and I did n't save the receipt because I assumed that Fisher Price toys were sturdy . This toy is a complete frustration to me and my son . It is constantly falling apart , the noises work only once or twice after pushing the button because the switch becomes dislodged after one or two presses ( then `` MOM ! ! ! Fix the Dinosaur Jaw again ! ! ! '' ) . I tried taking it back ( in original packaging ) and ToysRUs would n't honor their return policy . I read the girl the return policy that was hanging above her head and she said , `` Sorry , there 's nothing I can do . '' I will be writing ToysRUs about this toy and Fisher Price for their complete lack of intelligence when designing this product . Yes , I am angry . Even if I did n't have the bad customer service I would still give this product a 1 star . It was really a BAD design . It should lock together more like Legos . Those tiny little studs do n't hold up against child 's play.EDITED TO ADD : I contacted Fisher Price Customer Service and they are issuing me a voucher for the average MSRP ( around $ 36.00 ) as long as I send two specific pieces of the product back . EXCELLENT customer service . Thank you Fisher Price ! ! ! My faith is restored	-1
My son received this toy for his first birthday . My three year old niece had managed to get her arm stuck in the basketball hoop before my sister wrapped it for my son . I thought that was just a fluke as my niece is very active and likes to explore . My son likes the toy 's music and flashing numbers on the scoreboard but is n't crazy about the football or baseball . They snap onto the toy at the bottom and do n't stay on very well anyway . My son has had this toy for a month now and a few days ago he managed to get his arm stuck in the basketball hoop as well . There is a small plastic wedge that depresses when the ball goes through the hoop that activates the music and lights . My son put his hand down the hoop after the ball and the lever depressed , but once his hand cleared the hoop , it released , leaving him unable to pull his hand back up . I was sitting next to him and was able to reach in and depress the lever enough to slide his arm out but it still scared him enough to make him cry , and he 's a tough little guy . I think this toy could be dangerous and my son is not playing with it until my husband takes it apart and removes that lever . I do n't know how much my son will enjoy then because there will be no sound or lights ... there are better toys in this price range that are not hazardous .	-1
I 've never tried Little Tikes toys before so when Toys R Us had a sale ( buy 1 get 1 ) I was like let 's try them out . Got 6 things . The Sports Center , Tool Bench , Guitar , Xylophone and 2 30th Anniversary Coupes . EPIC FAIL on all except the coupes.The toys are cheaply made with little to no thrills . They 're essentially 1 dimensional toys with just the `` play '' factor . The ones that have sounds have a limited capacity with barely audible noise/music . I have been intrigued with most of my son 's toys , this one lasted barely a minute out of the box before we moved on and opened another toy . Awful waste of money.Why I did n't like the Sports Center : The scoreboard counts to 10 - then does a half cheer and resets to 0 . That 's it , nothing more - no music - no sound effects beyond a cheer - nothing snazzy or jazzy about this toy . The football - just spins , the baseball , the ball does n't detach , the bat is lame . It 's a very limited toy in the education department , things that he 's been doing or learning with other toys.What I 'm going to do : Try to return it - if they 'll take it back , if not , I 'll just chalk it up to a lossWhat I did : Went and got the Fisher Price Brilliant Basics First Baseball - so far AMAZING ! ! The ball is attached for baby 's use now , as he gets older , the holder rises and he can swing the bat and hit the ball ( coordination pending ) . Really recommend that toy instead of this waste of space Little Tikes Sports CenterWhat I learned : Stick to Fisher Price - Little Tikes is great for large toys ( ride ones ) but not so much for the little stuff . Do not get my money 's worth .	-1
This does n't work at all . It 's supposed to be powered by the sun and spin faster as you get it closer to sun light but I could put this outside at high noon and it 'll be as still as a parked car . Booger product , waste of money .	-1
Although I purchased it directly from this listing , the radiometer I received is not the same . The base of the version that is now being sent is not flared , nor is it glossy . The bulb shape is different and the internals look very different ( ie very cheap ) and is off center . The top part that spins is loosely placed on top and is poorly balanced . I bought this based on all of the five star reviews but obviously did not receive the same quality of product that others did . This one bare spins in full direct sunlight and does nothing in partial sun.If you are purchasing after April of 2014 and expecting to get the product pictured ... .beware !	-1
In what galaxy is this toy worth $ 400 ? This toy originally sold for somewhere between $ 60 and $ 80 . It has been discontinued only because newer models of Dora 's kitchen are available .	-1
I bought this item because it was Dora . I was disappointed with quality of the plastic , compared to the Little Tikes kitchen . Otherwise , great idea if they improved the durability .	-1
Bought my kids these , magformers , superstucks and lincoln logs for christmas ... the only ones they actually play with are the magformers and the superstrucks.. would NEVER buy these again ...	-1
I bought this for my eighteen month old last Christmas and just came upon it again during my spring cleaning . I remember she was very excited about it when she first opened it and laughed and clapped the first time she saw it move around , but that excitement quickly wore off.It responds to clapping and voice just as advertised , but it always plays the same horribly annoying song ( imagine Tigger singing like MC Hammer ! ) . It tumbles alright ( better on Berber carpeting or bare floor than thicker carpeting ) . It is just not all that much fun - and the song is LOUD and annoying . It is also difficult to 1 ) get it out of the box and 2 ) change the batteries - well not difficult so much as time-consuming since you have to change batteries in two places . It is also very hard and not at all cuddly.It is built for one purpose only - to do cartwheels . In the age of voice-response toys like Scamp the playful pup and My friend Amanda , this is pretty primative . It does not allow for the child to use any imagination or any cognitive skills . It is basically a 'gee-whiz ' toy to be passively watched . I have not seen my daughter even give it a sideways glance since Chirstmas morning . Not worth the money or time - and did I mention the song is annoying ?	-1
My dad bought two of these tiggers for my two little ones for their birthdays and they tiggers kept falling over no matter what surface of floor they were on . We ended up taking one of them back and we thought it was a manufactuer defect but it was the toy in general . The second tigger we bought did the same thing . Every now and then it would work but less often that it should . Very upsetting to the children . This toy is truly a waste of money . We love tigger but I would not purchase this one if you truly want to be satisfied !	-1
Seems to me the `` Little People '' sub-brand comes in two versions , the high-quality , durable ones that promote hours of play ( like the farm and the gargage ) and the low-quality , poorly made ones that seems to take up space . this is one of those . The racetrack is made of flimsy plastic , takes up a lot of space for what it is ( does n't fold up or anything -- you have to take it completely apart if you want to store it ) . The car itself is pretty solid , but does n't always function well .	-1
My kids ( 2 and 4 ) have had this for about a year . It hardly ever gets played with . The house , castle , garage , farm , zoo , barn , boat , circus , playground ... everything else we 've tried is a big hit . This has little if any creative play possibilites . My son loves to see things go , and this does move around the racetrack , but he gets bored with it as soon as we get it out . As another reviewer noted , it takes up a lot of space when it 's taken apart into its four sections . We have not , however , had any problems with durability .	-1
We had the same problem with the durability of the car ( seems the `` clutch '' stripped after a few minutes of play ) and the difficulty making it around the track.The Little People farm is a much better choice , triggering so much imaginative play . The farm animals get more use out of the race track than the car driver does - the chicken has learned how to drive , the rest of the critters like to sit in the grandstands , and the food cart gets tuned up at the pit stop.Oh , and my 2 year old uses the award stand as a `` compooter '' to play school .	-1
Our son got this toy for a christmas present and loved it - for about a day . He loved making the car move on his own - all you have to do is push down on the driver 's head . Then it stopped moving on its own . We took the car apart to see if we could fix the problem but the gears are made of plastic and the teeth broke on one and we were unable to get it to move on its own again . We still have the gift receipt and are going to return it and see if we can get one that will last for more than one day . At the very least it would be nice of Fisher Price to sell individual cars that would work on the track once the orginal one breaks if they ca n't make a model that will stand up to the wear and tear of a 1 1/2 year old.Overall I have been happy with other Little People set we have - this was just really disappointing because our son was really enjoying it ( and we were too ) .	-1
This doll is not good for girls ! ! ! She looks like a frigging STRIPPER ! ! ! ! BUY A MY SCENE ! ! !	-1
Ugh.. I really , honustly think MGAE did n't put enough facial detail into this doll . She has dark red blush , her eye shadow is too dark for her , and her eye lashes are too long . Also , you ca n't even see her nose . Whats the point ? Also , her hair is too dry , and cruchy . Also , the fashions definetly are n't working out for her ( she looks bad in pink ; purple is her best color ) Overall , i think it is the waste of money . I am not a big Dana fan , but i am a big Bratz fan , and this is a poor excuse for a Bratz doll .	-1
I love Bratz and have collected a lot of them and I wanted Wild Wild West Dana when I first saw pictures of her . However , I recently saw her in a store and was shocked by her eyes ! They 're absolutely dreadful ! The lines in her irises ( the colored parts of her eyes ) are way too dark and make it look like she 's been hypnotized or that she 's in a trance . The person at MGA who approved this doll 's face should be fired because I doubt anyone will find her eyes attractive ! I saw Wild Wild West Fianna and Yasmin and they both have regular Bratz eyes so I wonder why they gave Dana such weird eyes ? This is the first time I 've given a Bratz doll a bad review but Dana 's eyes just ruin her whole look . The rest of the doll looks fine and I love the clothes , but now I doubt I will be buying Dana because I just ca n't get past her eyes .	-1
My 4 year old daughter received this for Christmas . She really enjoyed playing with over the Christmas holiday weekend . It 's cute , but not high quality , and way too big.Once it 's assembled , it stays that way , with a base approximately 24 '' by 18 '' , and standing at approximately 18 '' high . It will have to find a place on the floor or a table , and then stay there . If we 've got to relinquish 3 sq ft of floor or table space in our playroom , I 'd prefer it be for a toy with more long-term appeal . With any luck , my daughter will tire of it , and we can scavenge the juice bar ( which wo n't click into place on our set ) , skyride , and ponies , while chucking the rest of it .	-1
It 's really too bad this company took a great toy and ruined it by such shoddy quality issues . The sound on this tractor is a joke ! It would have been better to just not have it at all . I mean really why bother installing something that 's just going to make customers upset . The tractor has many nice things but it is ruined by something as silly as 4 little animals that wo n't stay in place . Every time the tractor is moved the animals fall over and of course end up on the floor . If you 're going to do something , do it right for God 's sake ! The places where the animals are suppose to sit are too shallow . How 's that possible ? Whoever designed this should be fired along with the quality control person that let this toy out the door ! My grandson is 18 months old and he loves this tractor . He can lift it up with no problem and maneuver it well and really likes to open and close the lid on the compartment . Oh yes , and its already assembled ! ! ! But this toy costs a pretty penny when half of it does n't work properly . I am extremely disappointed .	-1
Fisher price is a reputable toy company with lots of innovative ideas and this CAN be one of them if and when it works . The killer app here is of course , the fact that the doll will remember you child 's name and incorporate that into the speech.The problem is that these dolls were discontinued several years ago . The software has not been updated since . So it will NOT work on Vista , or the upcoming Windows 7 ( as tested on RC1 ) . The last software it will work on is probably Windows 98 ; therefore buying this doll means that you essentially have to maintain a computer with an old operating system ( unless you happen to have an old pc lying around ) .There are several versions of Elmo and other characters , it may be necessary to check each one to see if it will work your computer . Given the high costs of each of these dolls , this can become a very expensive and frustrating enterprise ! These dolls are great if you can find one , pay the high prices , and get them to work . Shame on fisher price on not maintaining them , and having such a short service life for their products .	-1
Let me start out by saying that I am neither a kid nor a hard-core cuber . I am simply a guy who used to spend a lot of time cubing in the 70 's and 80 's when the Rubik 's Cube first made it to the Western world . I still have the original cube - which works very well but does n't deserve being man-handled by every single visitor to my home . Alas , I set out to purchase a replacement that I can occasionally `` solve '' while I also wo n't mind if my neighbor 's kid messes around with it.The particular cube offered here is , quite frankly , pathetic . If you 've ever held a quality cube , you will instantly know that this is not one of them as soon as you pick it up . This cube is very light and the plastic has a certain `` cheap '' feel to it . As you would expect , a new cube is somewhat stiff - but there is a little more friction here than I would have hoped for . I am actually hesitant to use the word `` friction '' - it felt like there was a piece of gum stuck in between the cube . As though , somehow , the plastic is too soft to allow for individual tiles to easily slide past each other . Not fun at all . Now , I am sure that this problem would ease with time ( and use ) , but there is another problem just around the corner that will likely prevent me from ever finding out : Worse then the friction , is the simple fact that the stickers come off very , very quickly . Yes , I know , they are stickers - what do I expect ! ? Well , I do expect that they last for at least a few completions of the cube . With this cube , they did not . Instead , stickers started to slowly slide across tiles and I had to constantly reposition them . Of course , once they have come off and you have repositioned them , the glue is even less adhesive and the problem only gets worst . Obviously , once you start losing stickers , you keep getting a somewhat sticky cube , and you 'll never get enough use out of the cube to find out if the friction problem gets better . In essence , you end up with a useless cube.I must admit that I live in a very humid climate - which certainly does n't help . Of course , other cubes that I have purchased by now do not have any of these problems ... In essence , there is simply no excuse for such an inferior product . It 's a waste of money that wo n't provide the fun you are hoping for.As I said , I am not a hard-core cuber nor am I obsessed with achieving some incredibly fast time to solve this thing . All I want is good value for my money and a product that is durable and does what it is supposed to do ! Fortunately , if you are shopping around for a cube , there are a few sites that offer a much better product . Google `` cube 4 you '' for some excellent cubes . The guy operates out of China and only accepts PayPal . However , he is fast and honest - and you are likely going to pay less than you would for the Winning Moves cube - and that includes shipping !	-1
What a super-cheap rip-off of the 'original ' Rubik 's Cube that was initially introduced to us in the mid '70 's . Seems like ever doctor 's office , break room , friend 's basement , etc . had one of the brain-teasers to kill some time with . Main reason , that I , personally - do not like this modern-day version is that after the first couple of days - the colored stickers start to peel off . Very annoying - to say the least . The Rubik 's Cube had it 's day . Let it go . In this high-tech age , I could n't ( seriously ) see [ m ] any kids or anyone else - for that matter having much interest in this item . PLEASE do n't bring back the Pet Rock . Avoid altogether .	-1
This toy is cute and that is about it . If you need a decent speaker system look elsewhere . This dog does not follow commands , he does not walk . In fact all he really does is three things . Shake his head to the music ( kind of like the old coke cans and dancing flowers ) and light his lights to the music he is playing through the bad speaker he posesses . THis dog is a cute novelty , but only a novelty . Buy at your own risk .	-1
Cute product , and my kids liked it at first , but the sound quality is so poor , and the volume is so low that my kids stopped using it after the first day . You can barely hear this , unless the room is absolutely silent , and you are sitting right next to it . The movement is a bit noisy too , which does n't help . I wish I had paid more for the IDog AMPED version , which my friends are happy with . Volume is just way too low to enjoy this product , even with the Mp3 player turned up all the way .	-1
Never worked very well . Does n't shoot straight and always jams . Over all poor design and pretty heavy . Wish I would have gone another direction when getting something for my son .	-1
I rarely write negative reviews ( i just try to be helpful if an item has a negative aspect ) , but Santa brought this last yr for my 2 yr old daughter and it took my husband and I 2 to 3 frustrating hrs to put it together . Once it was together , the doors to the oven , refrigerator and dishwasher do n't close very well ( though they line up perfectly ) and are VERY flimsy . I thought this would be great since the fridge door was magnetic and my daughter loves to play w/magnets on our big fridge but she had no interest in it . The phone on the side constantly falls off ( and the buttons do n't even mash down , much less make noise ) .The faucet on this sink is so big and hardly moves . There is no room in the fridge or other compartments ( this and flimsy doors are biggest disadvantages ) ! ! ! It is so shallow and the room that is there is n't level enough ( everything falls over ) . The window area with the 3 removable flowers and the grill side have been hits with my 2yr old daughter as well as my 5 yr old son . The grill is great and when the kids want to `` cook '' something , that 's the side they use . Otherwise this just takes up space . I wish I had bought one of the basic wooden sets or got one by step 2 which usually uses really durable , solid plastic . The only reason I gave it 2 stars is that my daughter loves the coffee pot that came with it ( when you turn it up ... it looks as if the pot is emptying ) and she loves serving me and grandpapa our coffee.I would n't recommend this kitchen , even though the grill , magnetic fridge door , coffee pot and dual play are good ideas ... .product quality falls short ! ! !	-1
Too bulky and there are better products out there in single units . The problem with this tent is the poles you need to insert and this design makes the assembly cumbersome . I have seen other models which work as a single popup and they are quicker and safer in my opinion .	-1
I recently bought this item for my 2 year old only because someone gave her a set of 3 story reader books for Christmas and because it was only $ 20.First off , there is nothing really educational about it . It simply reads stories to your child , which is fine I did n't buy it for educational purposes anyway.Fun , sure my daughter likes it , she loves to be read to.Durable ... no..it is flimsy at best.We had it for all of about 10 minutes before it stopped working properly . There is no on/off button , it comes on when you open the cover and shuts off when you close it . We have to open and close the cover several times to get it to work , also it has stopped working in the middle of stories.We 've had this for 2 days and have had nothing but trouble with it.Hopefully I can return this at Target locally so I do n't have to deal with shipping it back to Amazon . I might exchange it to see if it is just a bad unit but I have a strong feeling that it is just the quality of the product . It is very cheaply made.If you really want a good reading product for your toddler , get the My First Leap pad , my son had one when he was little , he 's now 7 and my 2yr . old is using it . It has lasted over 5 years and I have never had any trouble with it . The Leap pad is durable , educational and interactive , the story reader is none of these things .	-1
This set is beautiful , with great details . The only negative is that the table is so small , there 's no room for additional family/guests . I was excited to find the older dining room set ( with birthday and pizza party items ) to supplement this newer set .	-1
I really like the box , the bright colors , and that it seems like a sturdy enough game ( unlike some of the really cheaply made games out there ) . But beyond that , this game is n't even worth the space that it takes up on the game shelf . I have a 2.5 year old and a 6.5 year old . We have played this game maybe three times . Each game seems to go on for what feels like forever . It 's just a dull dull game . It 's a cute concept , good quality , but just so boring . I think I 'll let my 7 year old write her own rules for the game . Maybe she can come up with something a little more exciting . We 'll see : )	-1
We received this game as a gift , and my 4-year-old daughter was excited to play it ( she has the Grumpy Ladybug game , and this is pretty much in that vein ) . This game is sheer torture for the parents that have to play it . There is no educational value in this game ( unless your child is learning to recognize numbers 1-6 ) . The game can get tedious as mentioned in other reviews , so the `` saving grace '' in most childrens ' game , i.e . that they play fast , this one does n't even have . There are tons of other games in this age-range that are far , far superior .	-1
So , what we like about this puzzle is that it 's enormous -- it 's the size of a first-grader.After you put it together twice , all educational value has been gleaned . There 's only 15 pieces , 6 bones are named ( Humerus , Femur , Radius , Ulna , Tibia , Fibula ) .Some of the long bones have their Latin names ( see above ) but then you get SPINE ( not vertebrae ) and HEAD ( not cranium ) and HAND ( Not carpals/metacarpals/phalanges ) . No mandible , no patella , no scapula/clavicle , no sternum ...	-1
Unfortunately this toy looks good but it is n't durable at all ! My son really wants to play with it but it CONSTANTLY falls apart . I would n't recommend this toy at all .	-1
I had wondered why I found this so cheap ... only 19.99 last Christmas . I can only imagine it was so inexpensive , because it is impoosible to put together ! ! We tried to assemble it a few times , but it never worked out ( I 'm convinced we are missing a few pieces ! ) The instuctions are basically just pictures and nothing is coded , so it 's hard to figure out . This year , I 'm getting my son the Imaginext Batman Batcave , which was a hugh hit with my nephew last year ... and comes fully assembled ! Unless you have tons of time on your hands and lots of patience , I do n't suggest buying the t-rex .	-1
I 'm really disappointed in this product.The tense of the verbs conflicts with the rest of the sentence structure.They should use a similar idea as their `` In Other Words '' collection where you can flip the magnet over ... and the tense of the verb changes to match the subject case.Great conceptual idea , but the finished product is junk.Back to the drawing board guys !	-1
Purchased in order to try as an addition to the suction tip dart shooting crossbows I like for skirmish games . Rather annoying to assemble unless one skips the purely decorative string . Primary deficiency is weak shooting . Even if one could manage to accurately target an opponent beyond four feet , anyone with a pulse can dodge or block the arrow . The `` other '' brand 's replacement arrows were somewhat more effective once they were made to fit the Nerf weapon correctly . Good for playing catch with foam arrows at close range but no match for the crossbows in `` combat . ''	-1
I gave this gift to my 3 year old nephew for Christmas and I am SO dissapointed ! ! My nephew is definitely a `` boy 's boy '' and is really physical and strong . He had the worst time spinning this thing and it never would go fast enough around where he would enjoy it . He actually enjoyed the music but the base is shaped like an oval so when he would try to `` spin the other way '' how Simon would tell him to the sit and spin would get all off balance and actually tipped over a few times . I remember loving my sit and spin when I was a kid . This is nothing like the product that we grew up with , save your money .	-1
I would love to rate this product higher , but I was expecting something more reminiscent of my own childhood . Did n't they used to be bigger ? and round ? Luckily for me I purchased this way too early for DS because he will outgrow it by the time he is `` old enough '' for it.He can get it to spin a half a turn at t a time so far , but even as a little guy he hardly fits on the thing.He loves the music and really likes to dance to it.We are definitely goin to keep it around , perhaps not as long as we 'd hoped , but nothing is perfect for everyone .	-1
A really large , battery guzzling music box . Certainly all it 's good for . It sits allright ! And sits ... and sits ... no spinning yet to be found and my 23 month old son has poked and prodded it from top to bottom . Too stiff ... almost like they went stupid crazy overboard on safety precautions ? It 'd take a couple of semi trucks and a good sturdy wench to get any action outta this thing . Catchy tunes , though .	-1
nothing like the classic . barely spins even if you give it a spin with no one on it . I thought we were upgrading from an old classic one we got second hand . it 's not the same . Save your money not worth it and it is soooo loud .	-1
This does not spin nearly as well as the original version , taking a lot of the fun out of it . Also , it is oval shaped , which does n't fit little bottoms as well . It 's noise is loud and obnoxious . Even my son grew tired of the noise . It 's durable , but since it does n't get much use , that 's really not much of a selling point !	-1
My daughter is 3 and barelt fits on the toy I cant imagine how a 5 yr old would sit on it . As with other reviews its very loud with no volume.. My daughter enjoyed the concept , not so much the toy	-1
We got this toy awhile ago and my daughter has yet to spin on it . The only thing she 's managed to do is step on it , fall , and practically crack her head open . I do n't get it ... . if she sits on it , it hardly spins at all . But when she stands on it , it spins too much and she almost kills herself . Plus the noise this thing emits is highly irritating . This is not how I remember the Sit N Spin from my childhood .	-1
We bought this for our 3 year old daughter b/c my hubby and I both remember how much we loved having one when we were growning up . This new version is just not the same ! The base is barely big enough for her to sit on ( and she 's VERY petite ) and it does not spin as `` freely '' as the old ones did ( probably b/c of all the electronics ) . The `` talking '' is pointless ... she just wants to try to spin on it , not follow the `` Simon Says '' directions . I give it 2 stars b/c she LOVES to use it as a stool to sit up to our coffee table and color or use her play laptop .	-1
My kids never seemed interested in actually sitting and spinning on this thing . All they wanted to do is activate it and listen to the music - over and over again . I could n't wait to throw this thing away .	-1
I bought this Simon Says version because of the reviews the original Sit N Spin got . I wish I got the original Sit N Spin . This one is oval shape which makes it harder for the kids to spin on it . No matter how much I tell my daughter and her friends to sit on the star , which is the longer part of the oval , they always sit on the shorter end of the oval and they fall off . We 'll that 's not fun . She does n't play the Simon Says game and is not interested in it . Quite frankly , it is too hard to all of a sudden `` spin faster '' or to `` spin the other way . '' It does have a on/off switch . Also , it maybe my imagination , but it seems to me that you ca n't spin as fast on this Simon Says version . It does n't seem as smooth moving . Purchasers of the other Sit N Spin with the lights do n't like the noise it makes and because it does n't have an on/off switch , but the fact is , the kids love that one . My daughter used it at her preschool . Buy the other Sit N Spin with the lights and music and just let your kid use it outside if it bugs you .	-1
I loved the concept and bright colors of this toy . I thought it would be educational . My 4 year old played it twice , told me how it works and wandered off in pursuit of more interesting toys .	-1
I had one of these when I was a child , and I loved it . I thought it was so neat how the little bubbles were all the same size , and slid down the ramps without `` rolling . '' I 'm not sure if I got a defective toy , but mine does not produce round bubbles -- it produces blobs . It 's not very nice to look at or very fun to play with . Get a better brand .	-1
It arrived broken ; one ramp was dislodged . I returned the item ( which was super easy ) and wanted to buy another one . The price went up about $ 4.50 in less than a month after my original purchase . Sad	-1
I was so happy with the product , but by the end of summer I was SO mad . It was great at first , but eventually the lid stopped fitting and for the last few months of warm weather the sand sat under 3 inches of slimmy water . No amount of air or sun would have ever dried it out . Its such a good idea , but the lid does n't keep water out . No one I know with regular sand boxes has trouble with water getting in so I do n't know why this one does . Little Tikes needs to re-engineer it !	-1
I brought this to play after Thanksgiving dinner , but it was a flop . This game seems fun on the commerical , but it was really hard for our 2 teams to get the phases out . We had all ages playing and nobody was doing good with this game . We will try again , but it may not be the game for us .	-1
Not sure where to start , but I do recall paying $ 40 for this and I quickly was sorry . Multiple parts broke quickly . Design is not good , do n't ask me why . I just remember each time something happened I went & # 34 ; huh ? & # 34 ; . In fact I would skip play vacuums all together . Let them use the real one !	-1
Very disappointed with this product . Cheap made and hardly any sound to the vacuum . Could n't get all the parts back in the vacuum to store . Sent it back and had my $ $ refunded . Not worth the $ $ .	-1
I bought this vacuum because it acted said it had suction ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... .it does n't . They made it sound like it would pick up little items on the floor and it did not . Very cheap looking and did n't last my son 3 weeks . My son who is 2 loves to vacuum so I had to buy him his own REAL vacuum . So NOT worth the money !	-1
This game is lots of fun the first one to three times you play it . After that , everyone I know lost interest VERY quickly . Every game ends the same way : one person races ahead out of blind luck because everyone else accidentally bumped into each other and went careening off in random directions , getting shot at and/or falling off the edge of the map . It 's too easy to get frustrated and bored with this game . I 've only played it half a dozen times and I have no inclination to ever pick it up again .	-1
So I give this a 2.5 , but I am comfortable in erring on the side of nah . I purchased two . My six and 2.992335-year old sons opened them and it turned out to be pretty disappointing in that each remote controls both cars . Oh my goodness . I could just see the disasters in a Kid Galaxy Morphibians Conference ! Maybe I am missing that electronical engineering common sense gene that alerts all buyers of two remote controlled toy vehicles . All that could be seen was a blurry little mass of long blond curls running up the nearest barstool as my 2.992335-year old ran shaking and crying upon trying it/them out . : (	-1
This thing is a battery monster , gobble gobble gobble . Eemmmm batteries . I would suggest another option a rechargeable option . Slow and noisy for so much juice .	-1
My son was so excited to get this toy , purchased from Amazon . The `` antenna '' is a long string and hangs out the top of the car . It did not stand up as pictured ! The car worked great for the first 24 hours , until it was picked up by the antenna which promptly fell right out of the toy . It will now only go a few feet unless you follow right behind it with the remote . Knowing kids will play with this toy , the antenna should have been more secure instead of flopping around . It also did not go in water . What a waste of $ 20 !	-1
I should have listened to the review that said 'this toy will break , if you buy it and it stops working then I told YOU ' . This toy worked once right after we bought it . The batteries were dead the next day . Replaced them . Used it once more for an hour , had a lot of fun . Batteries ran out . Replaced them . Then we tried to use it a third time at the beach and it worked for about 5 minutes and then quietly passed away . Now the wheels do n't turn at all . It is totally dead . Such a waste of money . Disappointing because my son loved this toy for the few minutes when it worked .	-1
I bought the bear for my wife as just a little pick me up . Anyhow , she like it at first , but its not something that she can cuddle with . The bear is too stiff and sheds like crazy . So , the idea was good , but it just does not work in the long run . Oh well .	-1
I have to say when I ordered this , I thought I was getting the equivalent of the Discovery Toys version . This one is very poor quality . The kids seemed to like it so that 's OK . The plastic cover that came with it was nice , til I realized to put it back on , you have to have the shapes in the exact place every time for it to fit . The pegs do n't stay in snug . They 've very loose . Nice idea , just a poor quality knock off of the original .	-1
I had n't even had the product for 6 months before it started rapidly losing air . It looks good , when it holds air , but unless you plan to buy one every 6 months , its a waste of money .	-1
I returned the first one because the hook to hang the globe is over the south pole , causing the earth to hang upside down from standard convention . The replacement had the same problem . This is either poor design or poor manufacturing standards.The product is OK as a cheap globe substitute for a young child . It becomes more of a toy than a learning instrument , which is fine for a very young child .	-1
Not sure why this costs so much when it is the quality of a 75 cent beach ball . Ours lost air the day after I blew it up .	-1
would work best if not played with . it comes with a string set to hang from the ceiling but we played with ours and it popped . bought it in sept 2011 , was in trash by thanksgiving 2011 .	-1
i bought these along with a play kitchen and play food but they are so small that they dont even fit the play fried egg ! so much smaller than i thought they would be . ive just been giving her regular plastic plates that she eats off of instead . the largest plate is about the size of a regular saucer or even smaller . wasnt too happy with this .	-1
I purchased several $ 6 and less `` field microscopes '' off of amazon to test them against one another . My goal is to find one or two models that are suitable for a homeschool co-op class of 6-10-year-olds . This one failed right out of the box . It was the most expensive model , with the lowest magnification , a useless focus knob , a cheap build quality , and no batteries to power the light . I requested a refund 10 minutes after opening the package so hopefully the seller will oblige .	-1
I bought this for my 4-year-old . I had one like it as a kid and remember it as being mind-blowingly awesome . This one is not . It does n't focus very well , there 's no definition or crispness to what you see , which diminishes the educational value greatly , in my opinion . I wo n't send it back , because it was so cheap that postage will be half the price anyway , and at least I can console myself in knowing that when my kid loses interest in 3 minutes I did n't go under for this . Given that my kid is 4 , this is no big loss ... When he breaks it I will congratulate myself on the money I saved ! But the next go round I will definitely go with a more expensive product in hopes that it will be the awesome toy I remember .	-1
These animals are very cute and a great size . However , the smell is terrible ! I smelled it through the plastic bag as soon as I opened the cardboard box . I thoroughly scrubbed each and every one in hot soapy water and it helped some . I had to scrub and soak them three times until I felt okay letting my kids play with them . I would have returned these but the box was ripped up . I have no idea what these were treated with but I wo n't buy from this company again .	-1
This tape was a little sticky and hard for the 2 and 4 year old to use . Its cute and does n't damage the floor but is not the best item purchased .	-1
little ones cant reel it up , so adults that have to reel it up every 15 seconds will throw it away	-1
Pretty disappointed with this toy . The plus is that the tape is plastic so it can not whip the handler when it retracts ( bcz you have to wind it up ) . The down side is that it is so HUGE even for little hands . Grossly underestimated its appeal for my little guy - and he LOVES tools . Save your cash .	-1
I did n't pay close enough attention but this is not self retracting . My toddler constantly wants to play with the tape measurer so I bought this one for him but I would n't have if I had thought about it . He does n't play with it because he does n't want to wind it back up himself .	-1
This thing was huge , and winding it up for my 3-year-old was a chore . Construction was cheap . Returning it for a refund .	-1
Good idea but this was bigger than I expected , which makes it a bit more clunky for smaller hands ( my son is 3 years old ) . Also , once you pull out the tape measure , you have to crank it to roll it back . The cranky system is clunky , makes a very loud noise , and not so easy to use .	-1
I bought these in 2009 and lugged them through a couple moves . They are very durable and did last through the years , but storage space was always an issue . Once assembled they do n't easy come apart , so you need to have room to stack them up and store them somewhere . My kids enjoyed crashing their matchbox cars into them and used them to build small forts for their action figures , but lost interest pretty fast . You would need several sets to build a medium sized fort or a wall large enough for a child to hide behind .	-1
I gave this to my daughter Xmas of 2008 . It has now been passed down to my younger daughter , so general quality is not an issue here . All included people and parts are totally neat and sturdy . There 's a cradle , kid bed , two adult beds , nightstand , books , vase with flowers , doll , stuffed bear , play carriage , kitchen table with chairs , old time stove , cat with kittens , bowl for the felines , baby bottle , plates , cups , pot , pan , rocking chairs ( all gone due to `` Feetzillas '' ) , side table , fire for fireplace , mom , dad , young girl , and baby . And that 's just off the top of my head . Chimney is an open design ( hollow ) to allow Santa , monsters , pyromaniacs , or chimney sweeps access to the fireplace and the rest of the abode . The specific problem that I want to mention here is just what some others have complained about- the hinges and the hook and knob closures constantly fall off . These parts do snap back in quite easily . I know that Playmobil stands apart with their totally plastic products ; I wish that they would consider adding metal rods and screws into the design of these take-along dollhouses in the future . Imagine walking cheerfully along , hummin ' a tune , with the loaded dollhouse in hand , only to have it burst open and spew its entire contents into non-recently mowed grass . We ( well , actually just me ) have learned to live with it by policing its loose aforementioned parts , but who the heck wants to do that ? The whole point of this house is `` grab-n-go '' , so please , Playmobil , make this ideal of mine a reality for future owners of this dollhouse .	-1
The first purchase was from Warehouse Deals for $ 5 or $ 10 off the regular price . It was supposed to be a complete toy . It was in fact missing trailer hitch and had scratches all over the white top portion of the trailer . We returned.The second purchase was at full price from another seller . This toy that arrived was not the trailer as pictured but an older version that was not nearly as well crafted , well colored , etc . We returned.Just not getting any luck getting the actual toy we see in this photo and description .	-1
I just received this play cake today and it 's smaller than I figured , but it 's not too bad since it 's for my 2 year old . But I got the product and the candles have pretend flames on them and the flames keep falling under a hole and I ca n't seem to get them to stand up . Not sure if broken or not doing it right . No directions so I emailed the seller .	-1
Cheaply made and dinky ! Not impressed with it . I liked the idea of Velcro and not magnets like some of the other ice cream kits I 've seen . My daughter is only two . I 'll let her be the judge .	-1
Thank goodness we do not own this one ! The one-year-old I was babysitting brought it over , and all three kids ( oldest not quite 3 ) loved it . I could handle it , mostly , myself , until they discovered the button that sings some random customized words to the melody of `` This Old Man , '' *OFF KEY ! ! ! * Let me say that once more : the song is played in one key in standard electronic-toy tones . The voice sings the song in an Entirely Different Key . It 's not just one or two notes that are a little off , it 's the Whole Song - by at least a full step.As another friend of mine put it , this is the stuff of horror movies .	-1
For you to be able to hear this phone at all , you 'd need to turn everything off , even your fan . Even so , the telephone is still not loud enough to cause attention . When we got this phone I was hoping it would replace an old Vtech phone my older children used to own 12 years ago ( when my children outgrew it , it was donated to charity ) . That thing was not only loud enough , it had at least 16 different tunes ( YES 16 ) , it would ring , say the alphabet , you name it ; anyway much better than this piece of junk . This one is way overpriced by the way . Vtech downgraded their original phone , took four dollars off the price and lowered the volume . Then they decided to share the original available features among a bunch of other devices including their overpriced children laptops with no backlight . None of then are worth the price , Vtech used to make such great toys years ago.PS I tried slipping a plastic piece like instructed , to no avail , it did n't work for me .	-1
I 'm surprised this toy got so many positive reviews . The speaking voice that comes out drives me crazy ! The inflections of individual words do n't match the sentence ; for example , the voice says , `` This is the RED triangle '' and the word `` red '' has this excited , overly happy inflection . It just does n't fit in the sentence . It 's the same with most of the sentences and sounds unnatural - `` Let 's call MOMMY ! '' It reminds me of a computer voice where the words are pieced together . We have other Vtech toys that we are very happy with . I wish we had a different brand of toy phone , though !	-1
The concept behind this mat is ingenious , but the materials let it down.This was purchased years ago for my oldest son , but I could n't figure out how to fold it , so it was tucked in the closet . Yes , I 'm embarrassed to admit that ! Anyway , my 3 year old found it and dragged it out last year . I do n't know why , but I was able to figure out how to fold it in minutes that time ! Wierd ... .. So , we 'll call the folding issue my problem ( although my husband still ca n't do it ! Lol ) .The BIG , BIG issue is the top layer of plastic peeling off . Quickly . Thus making this product completely unsafe for a small child , and quickly unusable even if your child is old enough not to put pieces in his/her mouth.Even if this were not an issue this would n't work for us because we have probably a hundred cars ! Every time he wanted to use this he had to dump all the cars ! Which means getting him to pick them all up again ! : ( We do still use this for car storage , but we never unfold it . I bought my 3 year old a carpet road mat and we love it ! It was more expensive , and does n't have the convenience of of folding into a storage bin , but will last for years .	-1
This is a cute mat . My toddler sons enjoyed playing Hot Wheels on it . Kids under age 6 can not fold it up into the cube shape unassisted . Only six months into occasional use , ours started to peel badly . It had to go in the trash so baby brother could avoid the choking hazard . Would not buy again .	-1
I rated Alex Toys Early Learning Playmat 2 stars because of the inadequate quality . I paid $ 15.86 for this playmat and my son loved it . The designs are simple and fun for a young child . The playmat is lightweight and the convert-able feature into a container was a major bonus.After only a handful of light playing on this Alex mat , the vinyl started peeling off . It was cracking in appearance and my money became wasted.Overall , I can not recommend this product . I expected more out of this brand and a longer lifespan .	-1
hard to re-fold -- - 3 year old grandson found it boring -- -- nice size though not too small or too big -- -very durable -- it 's just ok	-1
This is foam rubber crap . Do n't know what I was thinking when I bought this . Maybe its good for washing the tub after a bath . Kid got bored with this fast and I ended up throwing it away .	-1
Got this for my girls for Christmas . They barely stick to the wall and there 's entirely too many pieces . It 's a mess .	-1
This was a christmas gift for my two kids . We 've spent more time trying to fix it than they have been playing it . It 's a nuisance . DO N'T WASTE YOUR TIME . I read the negative reviews and bought it anyway . HUGE MISTAKE ! What a waste of money . We got it working and while the kids are playing it , it stops working again . Fixing this game is not how I want to be spending my time . And the kids do like it and wait impatiently to play while we are trying to get it to work . Just buy the books and spend your time reading to them and asking fun questions .	-1
My 6 year old daughter and 7 year old twin brother & sister ( who are 8 months older than her ) LOVED playing this game.. but the quality is HORRIBLY cheap . The stands that hold the face cards you flip up & down get stuck & wo n't go down properly , & the face cards slip out of them seconds after you just got it all together .. It is so flimsy . With my daughter 's love of Scooby Doo , I could n't wait for her to have this .. since I loved the original game & # 34 ; Guess Who & # 34 ; as a kid myself . I knew it would encourage her to really listen to the clues in order to narrow down who the last person standing could be .. but , unfortunately she only played it about 3 times since every time she takes it out it has all fallen apart again & the cards are bending do n't even want to slide into the stands anymore.. VERY DISAPPOINTED !	-1
My husband and I are intelligent people and we could n't get this at all . Its defiantly not something to keep your kids busy without your help .	-1
this is the most ridiculous sized child 's toy I have ever purchased . considering the age of most little girls who play pretend with dolls enough to actually & # 34 ; get & # 34 ; putting them in a baby carrier and carrying them around like mommy , this carrier was made for micro-sized children . my daughter is average sized for a 4 year old and we did n't even attempt to have her try this on . just looking at it made us want to laugh . it is tiny ! so unless you are purchasing this for someone under2 , buy a different baby carrier . we returned this and bought a different carrier from the maker of my actual baby carrier .	-1
I got this for my 18 month old daughter for Christmas . When it arrived , I could not believe how cheap it looked . We put her Baby Stella in it and put it on her back . While my daughter ran along , Baby Stella flew out of the carrier.The velcro is not secure , the carrier is very tight and does not give the doll wiggle room , the doll just bursts out upon any normal toddler movement . The straps that go around the back also dug into my daughters arms . They do not look comfortable.We returned it !	-1
I played with these as a kid ( a looong time ago ) & they worked very well , the toys concept is very simple yet we as a society have been sucked into this `` cheaper is better '' product mode either by our own greed or lack of choice in the marketplace and we get junk like this in return . The pump is super flimsy ( the old ones used a metal rod not plastic ) & doesnt seal worth a darn thus the rocket only shoots up 5 feet or so & it only does that 1/2 the time . I returned this one & bought a more expensive one here on Amazon ( $ 9 ) & unfortunately its no better ( the rocket fits so tightly on the pump its about to break every time you try it ) . It went back along with this one . We need to stop buying this communist chinese garbage and tell manufacturers/retailers we wont purchase their products until they stock better quality goods . Bottom line is this could be a fun toy if properly designed/manufactured !	-1
I remember having these as a kid I remember shooting them high in the air without issue and watching them sale back to the earth and doing it again and again and again . This one while looks the same does not perform the same . It 's difficult to use and does not nearly fly as high . The quality is just not what I remember	-1
To be fair , I did not purchase this unit from amazon vendor but the identical unit from another retailer.Disappointing Children the World Over Every Day ! Zero Stars . Utter Garbage.I could n't agree with the other reviewers any more.I would n't get this thing even if it were free . My son was so excited to try this and it was a complete flop.This toy used to be so much fun when I was a kid ; it flew at least a hundred feet in the air.But this piece of crap can barely get 3 or 4 feet in the air . The connection between pump and rocket leaks like a sieve and the pump is just garbage . And we continue to buy this crap from those enslaved Chinese children and peasants making a few cents a day in some enormous dreary factory , to support the Communist Chinese oppressors and a few capitalist greedy business , just to use up our money , ship thousands of containers across the ocean , disappoint our kids and fill up our landfills with plastic . Terrific.We need to learn to recognize this garbage from China and steer clear of the bait.These people should be covered in General Chow 's Chicken and left on an anthill in the sun.I love it that amazon is the only place where we can get honest reviews of products.Need to check it more often .	-1
I had one of these as a kid and was thrilled to find it in a toy store . I wish I had kept my old one . The pump handle came right off the third time my son tried to fire it off .	-1
I bought this game a while ago and have yet to play it . Kind of strange to write a review without having played it , but the reason I have n't played it is because of one of its faults . This game has a minimum of 8 people and it 's rare to have a party that size of people who want to play this kind of game . Another problem is that it 's very similar to The Resistance , but The Resistance is way better . For starters , one person has to sit out and have no fun because the game requires a moderator . The other major flaw is that a person gets eliminated every turn . If someone 's killed , they just have to wait patiently for the game to end . In The Resistance , there is no moderator and all players stay in the game all the way to the end . The only advantage this game has is that it 's 8-18 players as opposed to 5-10 . So if there 's 11-18 people at a party , they would be forced to play this game instead , but that just has n't happened for us yet .	-1
Okay , it 's a rubber chicken . I do n't expect once . But that sound that the chicken makes it is NOT what chickens sound like at all ! It is sort of close to what a slaughtered chicken sounds like . Sounds more like a cow in pain to me . Awful , awful sound ! And it is horrendously LOUD !	-1
we 've only had this beach set for about 3 months or so and the bucket already has a crack in it , the shovel is falling apart , and the water container spout top already fell off ( i think the glue came undone ) . our son has used this at the beach a few times , but i expected the beach set to last longer . the toys in the beach set are also not very interesting . product is very cheaply made .	-1
I love the idea of this kit , but the pieces did n't stick together very well . Not very sturdy . Also , the bolts are very very tiny , so if you purchase for an older child , make sure they put it together away from carpet . Not something you would want to purchase for a child to use his creative imagination , it is an item someone would need to follow the instructions with and only build what the booklet instructs you to build .	-1
I 'm one of those who had an original Erector Set in the 70s/early 80s . This is NOT , by any stretch , the same product . First of all , Erector , how about including a nice , plastic suitcase for the hundreds of tiny parts ? ? My son took the box out and parts are falling out from all of the openings on this inside & # 34 ; case. & # 34 ; We had to tape them up . These sets used to come with cases . Second , the instructions are poor . The bolts/screws are so small and sometimes very difficult to assemble . There are several steps that should/can be done beforehand that would make building a lot easier . Second , we 're trying to build the first model , a digger , and there 's a clear mistake where already set screws prevent the small back platform from fitting ! I 'm guessing these instructions were written in China as well .	-1
I bought this egg despite the reviews saying it was very hard for a little one to open . Uh -- CHEA -- that , my friends , was the understatement of the year . I decided to open it tonight , in advance of Christmas , so we can get everything ready to play with Christmas morning before we wrap it . I struggled to open this egg out the package even with longer nails to help pry it apart ( I 'd soon find out that even if I had talons I still could n't pry it open ) . Once I got it open , I tried to grease the parts where it connects so that it would MAYBE open easier . Nope . NOW IT 'S LOCKED SHUT . My husband and I both tried everything to open the egg but it 's not budging -- like EVER again . Thankfully we took the inside portion out before shutting it so our daughter can use that part . The only fun apart about this egg was my husband and I making fun of each other for not being able to open a stupid toy egg . It 's not worth returning because it would cost half the price ( at least ) of the item 's price to ship it back . Just be warned ( and heed the warning that I did not ) that this egg does NOT open easily if AT ALL . Pass it up and put the money toward a Small World Living Toys play food item that actually works .	-1
My daughter was extremely interested in how I crack eggs when we make eggs so when I found this toy , one of the only non-plastic egg toys that actually 'cracks ' I was thrilled.Unfortunately , these eggs are a little smaller than I anticipated.I would have been fine with this as my daughter knows not to put anything in her mouth but other kids in her playgroup ( all under 2 years of age ) aren't.Once the eggs crack , the pieces are small enough for a young toddler to put in his/her mouth and possibly get stuck.The deal breaker for me was that even if a kid does n't put the halves in his/her mouth , it was nearly impossible to actually 'crack ' the egg . At one point I though I might have to get a wrench to pry the pieces apart . It was so frustrating for our daughter that she does n't even play with these eggs anymore . She plays with the wooden eggs and pretends they crack or plays with the handful of plastic eggs she received at an Easter egg hunt . She takes the sunny side egg and stuffs it in the plastic egg.It would be nice if these eggs were slightly bigger to avoid being a choking hazard and if the eggs 'broke ' in less of a smooth fashion so it makes breaking them easier for a child.Save your money . Your child and you will not find these as much fun .	-1
The mixer did not work when we inserted new batteries , correctly . The batteries tested fine . Amazon has refunded us the price of the mixer . Thank you Amazon !	-1
The unfinished wood picks up every fingerprint , and is destroyed if a child gets loose unseen with a crayon or marker . The wooden pots and pans are glued together , not carved whole , which means a child who gets creative with a bit of water can quickly destroy the dishes.There is no depth to the sink , either , which makes it hard to play with . The burners do n't look like burners , and on top of that , they 're round , which makes them look even less like burners to my kids who have only ever seen a gas stove.Also , while I 'm all for natural toys , this is PLYwood . Which means it 's made with toxic glues . There is next to no value in unpainted or unfinished plywood . We are now laboriously sanding it clean and painting it , since for the moment , that 's cheaper than starting over with a new kitchen.I deeply regret buying this piece . It 's super cute , and small , so I thought it was great to have in our kitchen . I was so very wrong .	-1
We received this as a gift and I 'm glad we did n't waste our money on it . I think of a lawnmower as an outdoor toy but this one is meant for indoor use . It 's too low to the ground to push over anything other than a smooth indoor surface . We left it outside in the rain ONCE and the electric components for the sound effects never worked again .	-1
Only giving it a 1 star because the recommended age range is 2 - 5 and it 's entirely too small for my very average sized 4 yr old . Returned the product unopened , but it looked well built .	-1
As if girls in this world did n't have it hard enough , they now have to contend with this kind of toy . The toy tells them to dress in the manner of a streetwalker , and starve themselves to achieve this kind of look . Barbie has never really been the pinnacle of what we could achieve for young girls , but this takes the cake . Where 's the pimp that is clearly missing from this toy set ?	-1
Giiiirrrrllll ! Let me tell you ! I went to the amusement park last weekend and I saw girls there under 13 years old , wearing bikinis and temporary tattoos on their lower backs ! They were just switching around like it was nobody 's business and the parents were just standing right there , thinking it was just so cute . Then the other day I saw this tall , skinny girl wearing a skirt so short I was sure the slightest breeze would lift it up . Fortunately for her it did n't , so she must 've had it super glued to her thighs . Whatever ! Bling Bling ? ? ? That sounds like baby talk ! I ca n't believe everyone jumped aboard the dumb rapper bandwagon and uses that babble ! For real ! Anyway , this doll is a major $ LUT and she might as well be wearing fig leaves ! The doll 's name should be changed to My Scene Gold Digger Barbie . Skip this and get a Dora doll for your daughter . Hollllaaaaa !	-1
ALL U BRATZ HATERS THINK BRATZ R THE ONLY THAT WEAR STULS N HOES CLOTHES WELL THINK AGAIN LOOK THEIR WERE EVEN SLUTER CLOTHES THEN THE BRATZ SO STOP HATING ABOUT BRATZ R STULZ SO STOP FIGHT N SAY BOTH R SLUTZ I MEAN COME ON NOW ! ! ! STOP BI**HING OK	-1
I am all for Barbie , but I have to say , this is the sluttiest doll I 've ever seen . I have never been a big fan of Bratz dolls , but I have yet to see a Bratz doll that looks this bad . I think it 's sad that Mattel feels they have to make this kind of doll to compete with the sales of other trashy looking dolls . The other My Scene Barbies are cute and cool . This doll is just obscene .	-1
I am pretty tired of toys that look cute but do n't teach much . The only thing this teaches is numbers . Everytime you drop in a coin , the switch in the coin slot reacts and the pig counts the next consecutive number.The bank could have been a lot more educational , if it could recognize different coin values ( there are 3 different size coins ) or colors ( there are 4 colors ) . Instead , each coin simply makes the pig count up one number.So this toy does n't really teach colors at all . I 'd say a ( non-electronic ) pack of crayons teaches more about colors than this toy.If you lose a coin , the pig wo n't be able to count to 10 unless you remove and re-insert a coin . besides number counting , the only other features are fluff : an Old MacDonald song that advances a few notes with each coin and a handful of pig related speech when the nose is pressed.On the plus side , this toy has survived a handful of falls from the high chair .	-1
My daughter received this toy for her 1st birthday . It was ok at first but then the door quit shutting all the way making the toy not function as it normally would .	-1
This toy has some really great qualities ... It plays some cute tumes that the kids like to dance to and the brightly colored money is fun to play with even on its own . However , the slot for the money is too narrow for my daughter 13 month old to get the coins into . Perhaps this will change as she gets older . But my main gripe is that the door that is suppose to open so to get the money out is VERY difficult to open . My daughter ca n't do it . neither can her 2.5 yr old cousin or the 3.5 yr old I babysit . The coins go in but do n't come out which leads to tears of frustration from both my daughter and myself . the kids have to bring me the pig to get out the coins which defeats the purpose of toy . ****UPDATE****After much use , the diffucult-to-open door has been broken in and is not such a hassel to get open . My daughter is now two and still loves to play with this pig . She has learned about real money and has a piggy bank for loose change . After putting real money into her piggy bank she always runs to get this piggy toy to keep the money-collecting fun going . My daughter likes the counting along with pig and she has also taken to teaching her baby brother how to use it . He 's only six months old but he still loves to eat the coins and laughs at the songs . I would now reccomend this product and wish I had given it more stars because rarely do baby toys get used for so long !	-1
I normally love all the roll arounds toys and would recommend them , but this one has some problems . It is too light so does n't stay upright if a child pulls it unless they are walking very , very slowly , and most kids I know never do that . The balls also fall off it when it is pulled . I frankly would n't buy this and would invest in a different pull toy . My kids love to roll the balls around on the floor or use them with other roll arounds toys but ignore the caterpillar itself .	-1
My toddler is destructive like any 2 year old boy . He broke this within 20min . I tried to hot glue gun it back together but it did n't hold up . Very pretty , but just to look at not to play with .	-1
Wow ! ! I feel so ripped off ! ! This cart is a piece of crap ! ! You 'd think that paying $ 20 for this with all the little extras ( coupons , play $ , shopping lists , play food ) is a great deal ... not @ all . This toy should cost $ 5 or less . If I would 've seen this @ a store , I would n't have given this a chance & bought the Little Tikes one which looks way more durable than this joke of a cart . I do n't see this toy lasting a week . It 's so flimsy & not sturdy @ all . It just looks awful ... looks way better online . Do n't let yourself be deceived & believe that all the negative reviews are true . I thought I would give this a chance & it looked like a great deal especially when they advertise the extras . What a waste of $ ! ! 1st off , the cart is not all metal . The basket itself is made out of this flimsy plastic ... ours is crooked . If we try to fix it , it 'll probably break . The seat is made out of cloth . This cart is so short . My 5 yr. old son looks like a giant compared to this toy . The play $ , shopping lists , & coupons have to be cut with scissors . You can tell that the play $ was printed on regular printing paper ... looks very cheap . The play food is tiny & I 'm not exaggerating either.I feel so ashamed & embarrassed for ordering this for my son . I should 've believed all the negative reviews I read . My son waited 8 days ( actually longer 'cause he had to earn it ) to get his shopping cart & he was so excited . When my husband & I saw this , we were super disappointed . This is not a good quality toy @ all & any kid deserves better than this toy can deliver . Save yourself the time & $ & look elsewhere . I will be ordering another shopping cart & when we get it , this one is going back to Amazon . We 're definitely getting a refund on this garbage .	-1
Terrible . Table top came snapped in half . Poorly packaged . Sent it back and then rushed to Target the next day trying to figure out what to get my boys . It was going to be their BIG present Christmas morning . Do n't be a dope and wait to open the package and assemble it on christmas eve .	-1
My boys got this for XMas last year , so it 's seen about 6 mos of play . It is a great train table- lightweight , lots of fun tracks and easier/ less expensive than a wooden train set.The negative is that a few of the tracks are attached in with plastic screws . As you might imagine these come loose all the time and disappear ( my boys are two and five ) . We have n't lost any for good-yet . But it would be a real shame if we did as then there would be this random opening in the track . I 've seen this table at other facilities and they have the same problem , so I know it 's not just mine.I 've had to ask my husband to replace the plastic screws with actual screws that will keep the tracks in place .	-1
I 'm going to give this toy 2-stars . I would give 5 stars for the amount of hope I had that this toy would be a hit for my 1-year old 's birthday and yes - when he saw it his eyes lit up and he eagerly went over and `` tried '' to push it across the grassy yard . However , he was immediately met with disappointment . This lawnmower is very hard to push across grass . It has a lot of tension in the wheels . I guess this is necessary for the bubble-blowing mechanism to work . However , you must also push rather fast for the bubbles to blow so ... ... my 1 year old abandoned this toy after about 5 minutes of trying to push . You can push it easier across pavement but then the bubbles still do n't blow b/c he 's not able to push it fast enough . BUMMER .	-1
This is our second one and I 'm less than thrilled . It just stops blowing bubbles , the spinner stops spinning and just starts clicking . The first one came broken , the second one stopped working after a couple weeks . Not a great toy .	-1
My daughter got this for her 1st . birthday . We set it up and no sooner did we get the bubbles on and ready for her to push it did they leak all over the concrete . I thought maybe we just did n't have it on right the first time so I stuck a new thing of bubbles on it . Nope it got every where once again . After that we decided to keep it but NO more bubbles . She likes to mess with the buttons on the top and when she pushes it , it does make sound kinda like a real lawn mower .	-1
Ca n't blow bubbles appropriately unless the handles are pushed down in order to allow a lot of pressure to be placed on the back wheels . Only the height of an adult makes that possible . Very disappointed .	-1
It 's a cute mower and the quality is fine but it 's supposed to be a bubble mower and after a week it does n't make bubbles any more . I also agree with the other reviewers that when it did work the bubbles just ended up on the lawn and never blew around since the output is on the side and down low .	-1
My kids love it , but forget bubbles ... we went through the entire solution in one hour because they kept lifting the mower , and the solution was just pouring out ... horrible design .	-1
Design : As an industrial designer and Dad I 'm twice as disappointed when such great ideas are so poorly executed as with this bubble mower.The main problem is that the bubble solution is poured into an open tray inside the mower and as the fan kicks up it blows bubbles out the side . However my son kept wanting to pick up the mower and move it around , which emptied the tray onto our floor or the yard only to have to be filled again.To refill the tray you have to push down on an inverted bubble bottle and you ca n't really tell how much you are putting in , or if you even need to add more because frankly the bubble blowing mechanism is so terrible.Solution : We decided to just use it without the bubbles but the resistance on the rear wheels was so tough , I guess to drive the ineffective fan , that we had to remove that too because it was too had to push.. then it occurred to me , I 've just totally deconstructed this whole toy because it had a bad design in the first place . So I put it back together and returned it so that we can buy a vintage mower that is lighter and just makes sounds as you push it via a spinning set of washers.Bottom line : even buying this mower on sale for $ 10 I felt like it was not worth keeping .	-1
This toy looks great and my one year old son likes to push it around but it never worked right . I found some tips online for cleaning out the bubble making mechanism but it still did n't work right . If I pushed it fast and steady I could get some bubbles coming out but my son could n't . I bought this as a lightening deal for $ 10 . Would never pay more . I would not recommend anyone to buy this unless it is simply for a mower toy . Bubbles do not work .	-1
I was really excited to get this toy for my daughter as she loves bubbles ! I followed the directions exactly but we could n't get any bubbles to come out . I took it all apart , went through the instructions AGAIN , and still no bubbles would come out . Really disappointed and a waste of money . What fun is pushing around this toy if it does n't produce bubbles like it 's supposed to ? Which is the whole reason we got it in the first place !	-1
I bought this toy for 2 reasons . First my 17 month old just love bubbles . And second because he likes to watch his father mow the lawn . Win win . Well my son loved it . Love pushing it around the back yard like his dad till he saw that no bubbles come out and was crushed . Now if a adult pushese really hard both down and forward the resemblance of a bubble will pop out but a child could NEVER make that happen . My son played with this in the yard for 20 mins and even though no bubbles come out , the entire bottle of bubbles had been used . Super sad . If it were not for the fact that he at least likes to push it around the yard I would return it . But it 's the point of the matter that this mower should EASILY blow bubbles and it does not .	-1
Bubbles never really worked in it.. you had to push hard and fast to get them to come out . While it frustrated my son , he still likes to `` pretend '' with it so I guess it was n't a total wash. Just wish it had worked right !	-1
My son got this as a gift for Easter . It 's a cute toy . The noises are nice . But bubbling ? I think not.After following the instructions ( few though they are ) to the T , we attempted to mow and bubble . I was able to produce about 6 bubbles in total . The remaining bubble solution ended up as a slick across my kitchen floor , with a nice trail leading out the back door to the yard where it sits , untouched , 4 days later . Maybe my son will want to mow with it . Maybe not . And while he loves bubbles , I think I 'll be stuck as slave lungs for the foreseeable future if my emancipation depends on this thing.About the only thing it would probably be useful for is Home Alone-style antics , whereby a kid could trip a would-be burglar up by leaving it out in a walkway or by creating hazardous conditions via the hemorrhaging bubble solution . If it 's bubbles you want , this is n't your best bet .	-1
Like most everyone else , my son 's mower does n't blow bubbles either . My husband and I both read the directions , held the bottle down for ( our instruction book says 15 seconds ) the right amount of time and nothing . I rinsed the mower out and tried again but still nothing . We have used up all of the supplied solution . I even put some `` homemade '' solution with dish soap and rolled it in my living room and still no bubbles . I , too , was told by Fisher Price to take it back . I just exchanged it for a second one today . We will try it out tomorrow . I may try my daughter 's Gymboree bubble solution ( Bubble OOdles ) in it-that stuff makes the best bubbles I have ever seen- if the supplied one doe n't work again . I will update if I can get this new mower to work .	-1
This was a gift for my 3.5 yr old son . He is pushing it around outside as I type , not bothered by the fact that there are no bubbles coming out . I am bothered , however.For $ 20 , this should most definitely shoot out bubbles . I have read the other reviews that suggest rinsing , etc . But the fact that there is a homegrown solution to the problem does n't change the fact that this should work , it should blow bubbles.I am disappointed .	-1
I was so excited to get this mower for my son . I was greatly upset when I found no bubbles come out . You have to push down on the mower while pushing to get any bubbles and even then only a few come out . Very disappointed in this product ! Does n't do what it promised to do	-1
Lame ! Does n't blow bubbles unless I run behind it . My two-year-old is n't able to make it work . I read all the directions for troubleshooting , and did what it said , no resolution . Although he does use it to & # 34 ; mow & # 34 ; .	-1
Ok , for a toddler to get this going takes a lot of effort . I have to push it with two hands for at least 30 seconds before it starts to mildly disperse bubbles . The bubbles that come out when it finally does are weak . This thing is a waste of money and I am so bummed . My toddler has to use two arms to push it and it has to be on all four wheels if it will try to disperse bubbles . I want my money back .	-1
I was so excited when I bought this the other day for my almost 2 year old because she loves bubble . It was really easy to put together , but that was the only thing that was good about it . No matter how hard we pushed , it was really hard to actually get any bubbles to come out . I followed the directions of pushing for about 15 feet but it still did not work properly . I think I wasted almost a whole container of bubble solution ( eventhough I know it is really cheap ) just trying to get any bubbles to come out . My little one now just pushes it around the lawn or back yard pretending to cut grass . So at least it is useful if there are n't any bubbles .	-1
Very difficult to make bubbles with this machine.You have to walk at just the right speed ... and not many bubbles.I have tried different bubble mixes and strategies to get this to work . I am sad that my 2 year old can never make a bubble with this mower . I only can get maybe 3 bubbles walking down the street and back.at least it makes noise , she likes that .	-1
The item is good for looks but has few flaws.Cons:1 . Soap water comes out if the same was tilted by the babies.2 . babies has to push a bit harder to get the bubbles.3 . It does n't take good amount of soap water to store for longer duration .	-1
The doll I received is not nearly as lovely as the photo . The picture shows a beautiful soft faced girly dolls . Mine was n't nearly as soft and sweet looking and had two painted on front teeth ! They look horrid . Why oh why would they produce a newborn baby with teeth ? The vanilla scent was there but again not as yummy as other reviewers had found it to be . We have a Melissa & Doug 12 '' Jenna dolly and she is so much sweeter looking that this Calin doll . Everyone said to me look at Carolle for your daughters first baby as they are a wonderful but sadly this model is not . I have purchased many of their dolls clothes ( as they fit the Melissa and Dough doll beautifully ) and have been extremely happy with them in terms of quality and aesthetics .	-1
Rocks and wood achieve the same goal and are free and let 's not forget to mention you can do ALOT more with rocks and wood . Let them use their imagination .	-1
I son received this for his birthday from a grandparent . We set it up and the gears grind to a stop and just sounds horrible.We contacted uncle milton , they told me to return it to the store . I told them it was a gift and the purchaser does n't live near us . They basically told me that was my only option . After insisting they do more , they said that I could ship it to them at my expense and someone would try and fix it , but no guarantees . Yes that is right , I would pay to ship it to them and they MIGHT fix it . I figure I would never get it back.After I realize that avenue was a bust , my husband took it apart and did manage to get it working.It 's a little loud and kinda boring . You can only see the bottoms of the planets , they are n't tilted or anything , and the bottoms are the least designed -- they are kinda designed like the plastic covers you melt around easter eggs where you have the design around the sides but solid color bottom and top . The rings around saturn is cardboard.Granted my son is only 3 but he LOVES planets , solar systems , space . We read books about it constantly . This gift is up on the ceiling and forgettable . We also had to put a big enough hole in the ceiling to cringle a little .	-1
These appeared to be a great idea for the train set we bought our girls for Christmas , but they have not even been used after our first attempt . These might work for older kids who do n't take their train set apart after playing , but not much good when you have younger kids . They are hard to attach and do n't seem to hold together very well . Waste of money for us .	-1
I bought 3 boxes of these things to help keep my son 's train set together . All the good reviews had me hopeful that the product would work ... . well it does n't ! It might stay together for an extra 10 minutes but my 3 year old knows how to take it all apart and does . They slide on and off which allows the kids to figure out how to do it in no time at all ! Better to get a silicone type of glue and glue it all together . And if we want to add or change it up at some point the silicone peals right off without damaging the tracks . Not worth the money ! !	-1
The instructions are horribly written and the picture on the cover ? You need to work at this for up to three years to get a terrarium of that magnitude.If you decide to give it a shot , clear out a space in your fridge for it and be prepared to devote a good amount of time to it . Our friends actually do have things growing in theirs , so I believe it is possible . But you have to be very diligent with it .	-1
We were really excited about this item , but have been very disappointed . We followed the directions EXACTLY , even putting the planted terrarium in the refrigerator for 8 weeks ( which was frustrating AND a pain in the neck ) -- and still we have nothing growing -- after weeks and weeks of waiting ! Rotten thing to do to a kid ! The plastic dome is of decent quality , and we got living carnivorous plants from an online seller -- worked out much better . This is a TOTAL waste of time and money , unfortunately .	-1
Now this is just sad , really sad ! ! I got this for my birthday and it was the best thing ( or so it seemed ) , i opened it and looked at the information , and guess what ? ? It said that in a stinking YEAR i would say ... ... SPROUT ! ! Well , not really SPROUT just well grow ! not all the way , it looked like a baby plant , which is stupid . My parents said they would return it if it took that LONG .	-1
Growing CPs from seed is not easy ! And growing CPs in a terrarium is even harder ( they need full sun , wet soil , and a special soil mix ) . They grow native from Texas through the Carolinas and do not need the tropical environment of a terrarium where fungus will attack and kill . This terrarium set up is doomed to failure . CPs are actually very easy to grow outdoors with a little proper instruction . Obtain your plants or seeds ( takes years to get a decent plant via seeds ) from a reputable online nursery ( I have bought several excellent plants from Sarracenia Northwest ) and then search the web for proper growing instructions . Skip this item and the goofy terrarium domes at Walmart .	-1
The seeds have to chill for 8 weeks and then they wo n't grow , even if you follow the instructions exactly . I called the company and left voicemails requesting replacement seeds ( never got a real person ) and they sent some , which also did n't grow . I give up . Waste of $ 25 , and kiddo very sad .	-1
My son was so excited to get this in the mail , fortunately he 's easy enough to please but I was expecting a gold-ish colored treasure chest and what we received was SILVER WITH GREEN SPOTS ! If I had known it was going to be this ugly I would have ordered a different one . Why would a treasure chest have gold quarter sized spots on it anyways ? What is it supposed to be mold ? Not a fan of this toy being so grossly misrepresented . The colors are n't even close to what 's pictured for sale .	-1
I bought 3 of these pirate chests for presents . I was unimpressed with the quality . The chest itself is the best part and seems somewhat durable . It comes with a patch that was too small for any of the kids ( ages 3,4 , & 5 ) . None of the kids seemed interested in the flag it came with . It also comes with some plastic gold pieces . Not great since none of the kids liked it and they all love pirates . If looking for a pirate chest and your desperate then maybe give this a shot , but otherwise look for better options with more enjoyable costume pieces .	-1
Very disappointed in this toy ! One of the pegs came off soon after getting it , and now two are out and missing , making it useless . That just happened in the course of normal use , not from being thrown around or anything . I 'll be looking for a different one now -- wo n't get this one again .	-1
He is really cheap looking . I returned he was that bad . Terrible quality . Painted on face . Very , very fake . Not the usual quality of Melissa and Doug imo .	-1
thought was rubber material as other gogo truck . remains unsatisfied to see that they were hard material as my son is small and often tossing	-1
If you had a Flexible Flyer in your youth , prepare for disappointment.Sure , it looks like the original . At least until you take a closer look . The wooden slats are maybe 1/4 '' thick , or at least a lot flimsier than the one I had as a kid . Also , the wood is lousy -- lots of knots and a poor finish.Unless you have to have a classic sled , I think you 'd be better off with one of the new plastic ones .	-1
As many people posted-these are for 30 pounds and under which is not stated on the site . Very misleading and not safe if your child weighs more .	-1
i thought these water floaties would be better than the plastic floaties that are out there but these do n't seem to do the job in keeping our son afloat . maybe it 's because he 's quite small ( 18 months and 19+ lbs. ) . i guess we can try again when he 's older but from the reviews i had read , i thought these would be good for smaller kids . although they are easy to blow up and deflate , my son 's arms seem to disappear within them and we ca n't seem to get them on tight enough to stay .	-1
I purchased these for my 2 1/2 year old grand daughter for when she goes in our pool . The floaties blow up around her arms but the inside diameter and many times the diameter of her arms so her arms slip to the bottom of the opening . This means that she sinks down into the water to far for the floaties to keep her mouth above the water level . I 'm sure they would work for older children but they are useless for 2-3 year olds .	-1
I am completely unimpressed with this item ! First , it is SO hard to see the numbers . Despite the fact that the screen and squares are impossibly small , if you look at the screen in any way but directly on , all you see is 8 's in every spot ! Often I had to tip it one or another just to see what the numbers were . It is hard on the eyes and I often had to squint . Second , if there is a way to put potential numbers into empty squares , I have n't found it ! I use this feature often when trying to solve harder puzzles and was extremely disappointed to find I could n't with this item . Third , even the hardest setting puzzle was ridiculously easy . A real disappointment . Fourth , if you put in the wrong number it blinks . What is to stop someone ( a kid in my family ) from just putting in random numbers until they stop blinking and they know they guessed the right number ? It encourages cheating and means that you CA N'T make mistakes which takes all the fun out of it . Basically it 's a worthless product for someone who enjoys the game and the challenge of Sudoku .	-1
Sodoku itself is a great , educational game that anyone who enjoys puzzles will love . Unfortunately , this game is very poorly designed and manages to ruin the fun of Sodoku . The game has several problems:1 . The screen is the worst ever ! You ca n't see the numbers except at a certain angle , and the back lighting does n't really work . This game will strain your eyes and give you a massive head ache.2 . The stylus that comes with the game does n't seem to work that well . I used a pen and that worked better.3 . The game offers no way to check a certain square . The only error check offered is for the entire board , meaning if you make a mistake but do n't want to reveal all the squares , you are out of luck.4 . No way to notate squares . You can not put a note for possible remaining numbers for any square . This makes solving tougher puzzles really frustrating.Do n't buy this game . It is worthless . Save your money and get a book of puzzles . Your eyes will thank you !	-1
I was really excited to get this game and to play it ... ..there were 6 adults attempting to play it and we were all very confused ! It was so frustrating that we just stopped playing on two different occasions and I just gave this game away . We read the directions but they were not clear and the DVD is not self explanatory . There are a lot of choices that need to be made and people were confused about the game play . I was disappointed in this game and will just stick to board game clue from now on !	-1
Roxxi is my favorite Bratz doll . She is the bagirl of the lot , and a sometimes goth , sometimes punk fashion rebel . So understandably I was shocked to see this rather mild Roxxi princess look . Being punky does n't mean you ca n't be a princess , but the doll 's make-up is so `` cute '' that it 's ridiculous . Also , her hair and eye color changed from the original model . Roxxi has violet-blue eyes , with dark auburn-red hair . But here she has aqua blue eyes and simple brown hair ! It 's disappointing , to say the least . If you really want a Roxxi doll , buy the Bratz Tresures edition.Erm , that is all.CHOW ! And do n't touch the sushi.XOXOXO , Roxanne	-1
As an older Bratz lover and collector , I view the Genie Magic collection as somewhat belittling for such a fashion-forward doll . I am in high school , and my favorite Bratz were the older ones with bolder colors and gothy make-up . The newer Bratz are a bit on the cheap side , and these Genie Magic dolls are a new low . The clothes are ugly , the make-up is ghetto fabulous . Bratz have always been Ghetto Fabulous , but this make-up is over-glossy and Barbie-cheap . Maybe your typical 10-year-old will like this doll , but it really wo n't make her stand out in the playpen . Almost every girl has a `` cute '' doll . But very few have unorthodox dolls with personality , dolls that stand out and get lookovers . If you 're going to spend over $ 10 on a doll , make sure it 's different from what everyone else has ? Erm , that is all.CHOW ! And do n't touch the sushi.XOXOXO , Roxanne	-1
pros : very durable son liked it since it was introduced early on and he did n't have many other options . : - ) cons : phone cord way too short . dial pad is covered ( not sure why ) and the beads on top ca n't move cuz the stem is way too short and close together . opening the cube via the clock : no young child is going to get this . Especially for the age they recommend . You end up having to do it for them.Probably better options out there . My sister gave me a battat one that has no music or lights but has keys and shapes , going to give that one a try next .	-1
My 18-month-old daughter chucked this cube across the room ( out of frustration with its many challenging and annoying functions ) , and it did n't break ... that 's all the good I have to say about it . Like the others , my husband ( who is a born engineer who has missed his calling ) was the only one able to figure out how to open the clock door , we think the phone cord is WAY too short , the letters/numbers are too difficult for a 30-year-old mom to push through their respective slots , and overall the toy is colorful but very BLAH . We also would have spent more on an expensive activity cube that will last as well as entertain . This toy sits in the corner and is rarely used by my daughter or any of her playdates . UPDATE : this like-new toy finally made it into the fall garage sale . It sold right away , as it looked like new and I was charging $ 1 . I wanted it OUT of my house ! !	-1
This is not a good cube toy . As others have stated , the phone is too closely attached , the buttons play only one song and the bead paths are awkward at best . It also took me a LONG time to figure out how to get the letters out of the inside of the box . If it took me awhile , I ca n't imagine how long it would 've taken my daughter to figure it out . She mostly carries the thing around here and there ... WHEN she actually plays with it . This cube generally sits in the toy box . Please do n't waste your money ! !	-1
I liked the number of features incorporated into one toy , but now I regret the purchase . It 's a space hog , and the kids play with it enough that they would notice and be disappointed if it just disappeared . The paint is chipping off the letters , and they are n't a great fit into the holes anyway . The parts where the bead-like things slide on the tubes ( sorry , I ca n't describe it well ! ) are too close to one another for my son to manuveur them easily . The phone cord is too short to really use it as a phone . ( A friend who has an older version of this toy said that there is no cord attaching their phone , so I 'm thinking about just cutting it . ) Parts get stuck all the time , which is usually when my kids get bored with it.We love other toys from Parents ( whose name is on this ) and it 's a good magazine , but this one just does n't measure up . I had much higher hopes after buying ( and loving ) their blocks and their music set .	-1
My son and I agreed that this car is too screechy and annoying to be fun . Even at age 2 , he knows it is obnoxious . We gave it away .	-1
I bought this toy for my daughter for Christmas , having loved other Parents brand toys we 've bought for her . My daughter 's initial reaction was fear . It 's extremely loud , and needlessly so . I suppose the level of noise is supposed to imitate that of a real car , but it 's really just annoying if you 're a parent , and a little scary if you 're a one-year old.Once she became acclamated to the level of noise it made , it did hold her interest . At the very least she found the remote to be a good chew toy , and was pleasantly surprised that the button on it did in fact move the car about . Assuming she was close enough to the car . Someone said the range is about 15 feet . Maybe they modified our model of the car to be even crappier . Once the car got about 4-5 feet away , it was hesitant to respond and acted a bit squirrely even when it did respond . At 15 feet ( less , really ) the remote became totally useless.I figured in time my daughter would get the hang of all these nuiances and it would probably provide a few minutes of entertainment here and there . Time was not on our side . The toy broke less than two weeks after Christmas . The remote no longer works at all - and the batteries are fine . The car will turn on , and noisily sit there with its flashing lights , but that 's it . Needless to say , the small token of fun value this toy had is gone.Do n't waste your money on this toy - it 's a guaranteed disappointment .	-1
Horrible toy . It scares the crud out of my son . He can not even look at it without shreeking . We 've had to put it in the basement , in a box , so he ca n't see it . Maybe when he 's older ( he 's 17 months ) we 'll try it again . And no , he 's no whimp . This is simply a very loud toy that makes fast , random movements .	-1
This is a very durable , very easy to use car - perfect for a toddler . Good size , and easy to hold remote control . Sounds great , right ? Sure , if you can stomach the noise , which is AWFUL and can not be turned down or off . Save yourselves , run far , run fast - do n't buy this product .	-1
here 's an example of a toy with a great idea but poor product . My son received this car for his first birthday . He likes it and by 16 months learned to push the button to make it go . But after 4 months of light use it stopped rolling . New batterys do n't help . It sounds like it 's working but wo n't roll . Dad is taking it apart to try to fix it but we should n't have to resort to that in just 4 months . Aside from that , a major downside is that there is no automatic shutdown . If your toddler loses interest in the toy after a few minutes ( they all do ) , the car continues to make noise until someone gets up to shut it down ( draining the battery ) . Seems like a small thing but it gets annoying . For the price , it may be acceptable to some . Aside from its problems it 's perfect for toddlers . There is just one button to push to make it go ; push it once and it goes in forward ; push it again and it turns to the left ; push it again it goes forward again . So it 's not something you can truly `` steer '' or anything but it does give a toddler a sense of control . If they could add a auto shutdown feature and improve the reliability it could be a great little toy .	-1
The main problem with it is the wheels . They are a hollow plastic ( rubber-like ) material . It makes the wagon difficult to pull , steer , and noisy . The one I got was also uneven . One wheel did n't always touch the ground without a load . The door feature is nice so the kid can get in and out easier . The storage seat is useful but , should be on the side of the handle since the kid will most often be sitting in the back to face forward . The kid will or wo n't like it regardless of the wheels but , the parent having to pull the thing will want better wheels . Basically , you save about $ 20 compared to the basic plastic Radio Flyer which has real solid rubber wheels . I think the RF is definitely worth the extra money . As a matter of fact I returned this one and got the RF ...	-1
Can someone please tell me why this is priced at $ 89.00 ? Does that sound right to you ? Why would someone pay this much for a piece of plastic ? I 'm finding a lot of these at ridiculous prices , and I just ca n't understand it !	-1
If you plan to give this as a gift , be sure to include the required batteries and some colored pencils . You 'll also need a screwdriver to open the battery compartment . Not exactly ready to go out of the box.Unless your child is really into fashion and tracing , this will probably have limited appeal . There are only so many combos you can make.All three examples on the Ravensburger box have been colored in are Caucasian . How about a little ethnic variety , there , Ravensburger ? If you want to save about $ 10 and come a little closer to true fashion design in terms of picking out and mixing up fabrics , the American Girl Doll folks have created a craft book that my daughter *loves* and plays with time and time again : http : //www.amazon.com/Paper-Doll-Fashion-American-Girl/dp/1593696922/ref=sr_1_1 ? s=books & ie ; =UTF8 & qid ; =1343828734 & sr ; =1-1 & keywords ; =paper+doll+fashion+funBottom line , others have praised features such as portability , and it 's true that this might be half decent toy to take on a trip ( if you pack pencils ) where options are limited . In general , I do n't think the long-lasting appeal ( or really , the lack thereof ) justifies the bother of buying extra components and paying this price .	-1
Okay you need batteries to use this . It makes sense because you have to have light and shadow to trace . But Jebus on a Cracker , I am so tired of everything needing batteries and I REALLY wish more toy companies would send starter batteries with a toy . Let me know that is the case in the description and I 'll be happy to pay a bit more to cover the cost . trace the This has a bunch of different This might sound a bit whiny , but what the heck.It worked all right . I wish the flat radius to trace on was wider and longer . You know , there was more space . Not a bad toy . But I would not buy it as a gift for another kid .	-1
My grandson , who loves pirates , has nothing to do with this toy . Maybe an older kid would like it . It sits under his bed , unused and un played with .	-1
I like this dog because it 's cute , but it 's a very average toy . The dog does n't stay upright when being pulled by the string . So usually my daughter is dragging the dog around on its back . However , she still enjoys dragging it around .	-1
This is a cute toy however , my children lost interest after about a month . Also , the `` leash '' should be about 6 inches longer for comfort of your little one and it would make it easier to pull . I would not recommend this toy .	-1
The only sound this dog makes is an anemic arf while the wheels are turning . It does not bark like a dog or bark the B-I-N-G-O song like 'Sing Along Lil ' Snoopy ' . I was hoping to get another Sing Along dog so my twins would n't fight over our one , but I was disappointed .	-1
My 1-1/2 y/o just has n't seemed the least bit interested in playing with this toy from the first day she received it until now .	-1
This toy is nothing spectacular . I got it when my 14-month-old because he was just starting to walk and he loves puppies . However , he 's not too interested in this toy . When you pull it around ( or push it ) the dog makes a little squeak . It does n't sound anything like a woof , bark , or any other kind of dog noise . My son is now 16-months-old and he walks really well , but he 's still not interested in this toy . A few times I 've seen him try to play with it , but he just lifts the `` leash '' up and ends up carrying the dog around ... instead of `` walking '' the dog . It 's kinda cute , but not really `` fun '' or `` entertaining '' .	-1
My 9 month old likes this toy for the music and is able to put the pieces in . However , only 1 of the pieces talks when he puts it in . The circle is the only one that says anything . Faulty sound . Should have listened to the negative reviews . Otherwise it 's a nice simple puzzle toy .	-1
I bought these because I have older grandchildren who loved playing with the smaller version of these , but I wanted something safer for my younger grandchildren ( so they would n't choke on them ) . Unfortunately , they are n't very easy to build with and the kids get frustrated because they wo n't stay together -- even for me . I 'm disappointed because they were costly and really do n't perform as I hoped .	-1
The idea of a magnetic construction set is cool Too bad this one does n't work and , ultimately , is a total waste of money.The parts are well constructed , but heavy . The magnets are weak . Put the two together and you have a construction set you ca n't build anything with.Go beyond the simplest pyramid and everything simply falls down . Even a simple square is a challenge to keep standing . The illustrations in the company 's advertising and on its packaging are deceptive : you can not build the projects shown with the set as it is deliveredSave your money and avoid this product.Jerry	-1
So I bought these for our almost 3 year old for Christmas . Unfortunately the magnetic strength is awful . The product does come exactly like described , the seller was prompt , but none of that matters if the toy is useless . The balls are where the problem is , they slip and slide all over . Extreme frustration ... ... ..So I returned them . Great concept- but the toy needs a redo !	-1
My 18 month old really WANTS to play with this toy , but the tracks wo n't stay together long enough for him to enjoy it . I have to CONSTANTLY reattach the tracks on top and bottom . IF he does n't touch the tracks at all , it works fine . But as soon as he bumps it , or tries to move it everything falls apart . My sister , however , has this toy for her son and have never had any problems with the assembly failing . Had I known sooner , I definitely would have exchanged it for a new one . Too late now .	-1
My son has pretty much every one of these sets . They all have the same problem , great idea , poor quality . It does n't seem to bother my son , as much as it does me . This is because I think he has just as much fun saying , `` Broken Mommy '' as he shoves one of the tracks in my face for me to fix it . Most recently the red part broke off of it . Being a boy , he has found lots of uses for the parts , and does n't seem to care that it does n't hold up very well . I suppose that is the most important part.Having said that about the set , the cars that come with it are amazing , and he uses them all the time . We have just about all the packs of cars , and they go on all the different sets ( whenever we have `` fixed '' them ) . We have superglued other sets , and it just did n't help .	-1
My husband and I bought this car because it looked fun and because we thought it would last a while because of the different configurations it could be made into.Boy , we were wrong ! She did not like being in it at all , no matter which configuration we put it in . In , fact it seems that for a child her age/size the seat was too wide to be comfortable because it spread her legs so far out.Plus , like other reviewers said , when we tried to push her in it she held on to the steering wheel so that it was always turning and it made it hard to push her around . It 's an illogical design.After a few days of my daughter not liking it , we took it back to the store and bought the Step 2 Push Around Buggy . She loves that one ! It 's really comfortable for her and she can easily hold on to the fake steering wheel . I can push it more easily because she does n't control the steering . The Step 2 version does not have several configurations , but it 's more durable and sturdy and my daughter loves it so much I think she 'll get a lot of use out of it for a long time .	-1
This ride on car was a gift for my daughter to give her something fun to play with outdoors . I was hoping for something that I could take her on long walks with and that she could learn to steer and drive one day . Unfortunately , this was n't the case and I was glad to see from the other reviews , that it was n't just me having these issues . First , our car did not come with a seatbelt or strap . As my child was 9 months old at the time , I worried about her falling out of it even though she had good balance and control . When she tried to climb out of it , it could easily tip over . Once she grew and could steer this thing , she would turn in circles . The adult handle on the back does n't help you steer ! Instead , I had to hunch over and constantly turn the wheel to actually get us to go somewhere . I always end up with a backache after using this . My daughter does like playing with the music buttons and thinks it is fun to drive . I am looking for an alternative to this . Will be getting rid of this toy in the next garage sale !	-1
This ride-on was a gift when my son was 12 months old . It is VERY unstable and not durable . The only feature my son was interested in was the removable dashboard which plays music and makes different sounds . If you 're willing to spend extra money , I highly recommend the Radio Flyer sport coupe . You wo n't be disappointed .	-1
Just received this kit and it is only 15 pieces . No dog bowl , vitamin can , can of food , nor bone . The bone and bowl were two of the reasons I chose this set over others . It gives total care of the pet dog , not just the medical tools , which my son would like ! Will probably send it back now and look locally for a different set since this one does n't have it all like it states and displays in the photo . Disappointing !	-1
I ordered this monkey because I discovered that plush toys are difficult to find during the summer - evidently this is a seasonal item.The picture depicted a child hugging the monkey , so I thought this would be a perfect item for my very young grandson . When it arrived , it was much smaller than it appeared in the photos and reviews . I was very disappointed . I ended up getting a larger monkey from a friend ( who collects monkeys , as it turns out ) and sending THAT to my grandson.It is well-made , and Ty is a great brand , it 's just that it was too small . . . even for my one-year-old .	-1
In the first day my boys ( ages 5 and 7 ) had tied 4 strings in multiple knots that became so tight that they could not be untied - had broken the string in several places - and it become so dirty it could not be washed clean - not to mention they still wanted to chew on it . . ..	-1
the first one that we got the handle to the large broom was broken in half upon delivery . when we received the replacement and gave it to our son it took him about an hour of playing with it for the handle on the large broom to almost break ( handle is dented almost all the way ) . not very good quality at all . the small broom with the dust pan works fine but the large broom is junk .	-1
Booo ... . cost was reasonable.Then it came with a COD for $ 30.They only paid $ 6 for shipping , and I think I paid $ 15 for it.Total bait and switch on the price .	-1
I have 2 daughters . One is 2 y/o and the other is 5 y/o . They are totally different in personality and ... ..they both do not play with this bath toy . I waited a while to post a review because I wanted to see if they would warm up to their new bath-toy . Well , guess what ? Both of my girls have not played with this toy once , except the first day . It 's now over a month . There are a few problems with this dress up/playtime pals toy . The company that makes these toys ( Alex ) have changed their design . We have owned previous Alex bath-toys that stick on bathtub walls and they were more compact , thinner and lighter . This new design is thick and too heavy . They do not stay on the bathtub walls , just slide right off . Another issue , is that the size of the doll/clothes/accessories are too tall . If you want to dress up the doll with an entire outfit , you must have only a few inches of water in the tub , because the pieces are so large , there is no way to dress the doll from head-to-toe , when have a full tub of water . Do n't buy .	-1
This is a great ball especially to learn how to throw and catch . My only problem is it 's really small , better for an infant than a toddler . Super expensive for the size .	-1
I purchased this based on rave reviews from others . Unfortunately my baby was not at all interested in this toy . She otherwise likes balls , rattles and other items . I gave away to a friend .	-1
The colors are fantastic , but it is supposed to rattle . I 'm not sure if mine is defective , but the rattle constantly gets stuck and I have to forcefully bang it against something to try to free the tiny little bead ( which barely rattles when unstuck ! ) . This is one of those purchases I wish I did n't purchase . My son also has no interest in this .	-1
I bought this for my almost 4-month old , mostly based on its favorable reviews . However , I was disappointed when it arrived without a working rattle . There must be one tiny little pen-sized ball in there , and it makes noise only if I vigorously shake it - ca n't really justify this as a & # 34 ; rattle. & # 34 ; Also , while it is easy for little hands to graps , my baby holds it for about 5 seconds before losing interest . I 've been retrying for a month now , and she still hates it . Waste of money for me .	-1
This toy does not really make much noise or the texture is interesting enough for our little one to bite on . He just passes it by for other toys .	-1
I thought my baby would like this to chew on , but I do n't think he ever did . He would hold it once in awhile but not enough to be worth it . He had no interest in it .	-1
Didint love these and my 20 month old could have cared less about them . They look cheap and well ... . not very attactive .	-1
These simple , geometric Colorforms are such a great IDEA for a toy . They are open-ended , encouraging children to imagine their own stories and scenarios rather than regurgitate what they 've seen on television . They teach numbers , shapes , colors , counting , sorting . They foster creativity.It 's for all these reasons that I ordered a set for my kids . These reasons , and nostalgia.In fact , I have such fond memories of this toy from my own childhood that it pains me to say this : but these Colorforms are just plain GROSS . As soon as I opened the box I regretted ordering them , overwhelmed as I was with a noxiously potent , plastic smell of polyvinyl chloride ( PVC ) . The smell was bad enough that I returned them for the smell alone , but even so there were other problems . The Colorforms were discolored . Quite a few were peeling off their boards , leaving an oily residue in places . Ew . And yet the box itself was sealed and did not look tampered with in any way . Maybe they 'd been sitting in a hot warehouse for awhile , outgassing their nasty stuff , and that explains the smell and the discoloration and the oily residue , but jeez . I 'd rather find out that they degrade like this NOW , before I give them to my young children , then LATER , after my kids have been playing with them for awhile.Now , supposedly the manufacturer of Colorforms does n't use phthalates in its PVC ; but judging by what I smelled and saw , whatever it 's using in place of phthalates ca n't be good for little lungs and little fingers . And really , with or without phthalates , PVC is bad enough ( for human health as well as for the environment ) that its use in children 's toys ought to be questioned . PVC degrades into dioxins . Some of its additives include endocrine disruptors , heavy metals , and suspected carcinogens . Yeah.I knew all this about PVC when I ordered the box , so what on earth was I thinking ? ? Those nostalgic thoughts , I suppose . Well , so much for nostalgia . I 'll stick with eco-friendly , child-safe wool felt boards or magnetic boards from now on .	-1
It is a cute idea , and it worked the first time we used it , but ever since that i 've hated this book toy because it is so messy ( for a toddler ) . he does seem to enjoy it but i dislike cleaning it up . i threw it out yesterday , after only having it a few weeks , and barely using it . and fyi i dont often leave bad reviews or 'hate ' products . this one was maybe for an older , more careful child . and he did enjoy it himself just fine . he even put them into library books-which was creative and non-destructive . had he of used regular adhesive stickers i 'd of been in trouble . too many small parts for little children tho .	-1
My son got this for his birthday . His Uncle bought it for him and I thought it looked like a great concept . It took me a good 30 minutes to open the battery compartment which was frustrating since all the boys at the party wanted to try out the toy . There has been alot of tv ads on and my son was the first kid to get this . The boys played with it the afternoon of the party . the next day my son was just playing toss with it with his 3 year old sister and it started to just shut off . I tried opening the battery compartment , which again took at least 30 minutes and even putting new batteries it still keep shutting off . By day 2 The toy would not even turn on . Of course with all the birthday party clean up the box was thrown out so we could not even return it.I like the idea of the toy , any toy that gets kids outside inside of in front of the video games but this toy just is n't quality . I suggest if you do decide to purchase this open the plastic and put the batteries in for your child before you wrap it .	-1
I am 33 and am a total 80 's freak . I think 80 's and I think trends in music , movies , television , clothing , fads , toys & entertainment.I do n't remember anything about politics or the news or newspaper headlines or what was going on in Bosnia at the time . I was a KID ! This game is geared towards adults in the 80 's . My parents will love it . They are in their 50's.The 3 questions I got right in the whole game had easy answers , too easy . Nothing fun.Oh , and the tv and movie questions are always asking who the actor/actress name is , not their character , who we all remember . I do n't know Angela 's mom 's real name , from Whose The Boss , but it took a minute for me to remember her name on the show is Mona . THAT should have been the question . Not her real name . Who knows that ? ? ? probably my dad !	-1
I ordered a bunch of Mario characters for my son for his birthday , many of them came from China and the quality of each toy varied . This one , I must say , is by far the worst ! It 's about the quality of the toys that come out of crane machines , at best . The light brown part of toy is made with a cheap felt , NOT PLUSH . The dark brown is a very thin possibly plush material . The stitching is done poorly , there is green in part of the eye that is supposed to be white , and his mouth looks terrible ! Although , he is bigger than the 8 inch toy I was expecting ( more like 10-11 inches ) , I would have been far happier with a smaller , better quality , actual plush toy . Oh , and it took FOREVER to get here ... about a month . Will not recommend to others ! : (	-1
Do NOT buy this if you 're expecting any type of quality of the item you see in the photo - BAIT AND SWITCH . This is NOT the toy in the photo , not by a long shot . We looked all over for the specific one that is actual plush and good quality , like the plush one would purchase in the department stores . This is cheaply made , like those carnival toys - BUYER BEWARE . Do n't waste your money ! My son was so disappointed , as was I. Amazon , your quality and trustworthiness has REALLY gone downhill since you started contracting to outside sellers . I am amazed at how many claims I 've had to file since this has happened - and here is yet another one.I will say that amazon 's customer service was good - if they do in fact process my refund and make good on the $ 10 credit toward my next order . But what I 'd really rather see is a better screening process , and one that makes sure you 're getting what you 're paying for , because this is all a huge waste of my time and money - and Amazon 's , too , I am sure .	-1
I would NOT purchase from this company again . The price was great , but took so long to get and you only get ONE truck . I mean , the title says : Giggling Troublesome Trucks . plural . You 'd think it was 2 ! I brought this up to the company and hopefully they have changed the description.AND the one they sent was stripped and corroded ! Completely useless . I tried to get another truck and got a very confusing email several weeks ago so I 'm assuming I will not be getting another one .	-1
One of the batteries one of them died three days after Christmas ! ! I was a little upset by that . The other one is fine and is loud and sturdy .	-1
This was hyped huge but it was underwhelming for my uber creative 11 yr old . Easter is a non sugar holiday here so that part was good but the art part was , well , lacking ...	-1
We got this for our son for Christmas but it was so small that he would n't be able to put his journal in it which is why he wanted a box .	-1
This is an 'older ' system version from Leapfrog.You may want to check the Leapster Explorer or the Leapster-2 . The L-Max is a what older system now . We owned one a while back . Had a bad experience with it . Had to get a replacment . You can check my review on it Leapster L-Max Learning Game System . But check out theLeapFrog Leapster 2 Learning Game System - Greenor theLeapFrog Leapster Explorer Learning Game System ( Green ) , before you decide . These are both much more recent systems from Leapfrog , at MUCH better prices then the price of the L-max here . The Explorer is the most recent system from Leapfrog . Do some research before you decide .	-1
MY PACK WAS MISSING PARTS.HOPEFULLY I CAN GET THIS RESOLVED.BIG DISSAPPOINTMENT FOR MY CHILD .	-1
I am so disappointed in Leapfrog ! We purchased the pink leapster for my daughter for her birthday and it does n't even work . I do n't know how on earth this product made it past Leapfrog 's quality assurance team ... or should I say what quality assurance ? Leapfrog can not even warranty their product because they do n't carry the pink ones . All they can do is send a replacement one in a different color . That did n't work with my 4 year old that wanted pink and got one for her birthday . So , we are having to pay double the shipping to return the defective product and pay the shipping for the new one.The most frustrating thing is that this is n't the first Leapfrog product we have had to return that was defective . We also had to return the letter magnets because they would n't recognize the correct letter . NOW THAT 'S EDUCATIONAL.We wo n't be purchasing any more Leapfrog products because their quality assurance is sub-par .	-1
this product arrived defective . This is the second leapster i have purchased for my grand children and both they and the parents love them . Educational , fun and reliable with good battery life.Amazon took the defective unit back , no hassle and shipped a new unit immediately . You have got to love that kind of combination . I have also found the customer reviews immensely valuable when buying for kids that grow so quickly and ones you do n't see very often .	-1
I thought this would be a great toy for my 6-yr-old . Boy was I wrong . It was played with for about 20 minutes , then never touched again . I tried a couple different cartridges in hopes that the new themes would help spur interest , but to this day , instead , the leapster lays on a shelf collecting dust . Neither of my children found it very interesting . The 3-yr-old found it too difficult to understand . The now 7-yr-old never had much interest in it ever . I liked it- and played with it for several minutes to try and get the kids interested in it . No luck .	-1
We bought the pink Leapster this year for our 4 1/2 year-old daughter and a green Leapster for our 3 1/2 year-old son for Christmas to replace their original blue and silver Leapsters which had been `` loved '' and `` dropped '' to the point of exhaustion . Having had the `` original '' Leapsters for over a year , my children acquired quite a few Leapster accessories ... multiple game titles , rechargeable Leapster battery packs and charging docks to name just a few.Not wanting to start from scratch , but wanting to purchase their new Leapsters in different colors , I contacted LeapFrog Industries directly ( the manufacturer of the ever-popular Leapster and Leappad products ) to determine if their existing accessories and game titles would be compatible with the newly colored Leapsters . I spoke to a representative in technical support who assured me that our existing accessories would all be compatible with the new Leapster . He claimed that all of the game cartridges and accessories for the Leapster and Leapster L-Max were completely interchangeable , and we would not have any problem.After speaking with the representative , I ordered the new colored Leapsters online . My children opened their new Leapsters with delight on Christmas morning ... that delight quickly turned into tears as we fruitlessly tried to install the Leapster battery into the new Leapsters . The old battery itself is actually bigger than the new Leapster ... not even close to being the correct size , shape or dimensions.After frantically racing to a local store yesterday to purchase two new charging systems ( at a cost of $ 80 ) , I contacted LeapFrog again . While they do admit to seeing notes from my prior call in the system , they claim that there is nothing they can do to assist us . The only advice offered was to return the two new Leapsters to the store , or to purchase the required L-Max accessories for this product.When our children did finally have the opportunity to play with their new Leapsters , our disappointment in this new product deepened . It seems that two of the internal games that our children loved from the original Leapster have been `` deleted '' from this new version and replaced by a built-in Leapster software commercial.The Leapster is a well-loved toy in our home , rich with benefits for both of our preschool-aged children . Do n't let our bad experience sway your decision to purchase this product , just learn from our unfortunate experience and choose your accessories carefully . I would also recommend making your purchase through a retailer with a liberal and understanding return policy , such as Amazon .	-1
This is an 'older ' system version from Leapfrog.Why buy these , ... when you can getLeapFrog Leapster Explorer Learning Game System ( Green ) or theLeapFrog Leapster 2 Learning Game System - Green . The Leapster 2 is a more recent version of the system displayed here . While the Leapster Explorer is the MOST recent system from LeapFrog . The Leapster and the Explorer use diferent type cartridges . Check them out before you decide .	-1
The company suggests using alkaline batteries ( not longer lasting lithium ) . The downside to that is that this device will run for a couple days ( so mere hours of play time ) on alkaline batteries and then die . We 've had ours for about 18-20 mos. , and it does n't work at all with batteries despite trying to `` clean '' the battery area . Lest you think we treat the thing poorly , that could n't be further from the truth . My daughter is not snacking and drinking while using the Leapster . She 's not dropping it on concrete floors . When she 's done , it promptly goes back into a zipped up backback , along with the games , so it 's kept dust free . The Leapster is in pristine condition . But does it work ? Only with the AC Adapter , which means we ca n't take it anywhere with us . Leap Frog has managed to hood wink me into purchasing a Leapster and an L-Max , BOTH of which have the same problem ( both of our devices LOOK in great condition and were taken excellent care of - way beyond what any company would expect from a consumer , so the problem is n't with us , but with the low longevity of the Leapster product . ) The company does not stand behind this product and probably knows it 's flaws ( thus the 90 day warranty ) . If I could do it all over again , I 'd buy a Nintendo DS or something that might actually turn on and stand up to some play time . Ugh . I 'll never buy Leap Frog products again .	-1
My son loves Thomas and I must say that I love buying all the neat pieces to go with it . I love going through all the bridges and stuff finding the ones `` they '' might like . So when I saw this I knew he 'd like it . When we opened it up though and attempted to collapse the bridge , we realized that it took 2 hands to make it come down . I had hoped that it would take one and he could be pushing the train as it collapsed . Also , it takes quite a bit of pressure to make it collapse and the buttons and bottom supports are made of cheap plastic . It has n't yet , but I worry about it breaking . Getting it to come back up from the collapsed position is also kind of difficult and then you have to make sure the tracks are aligned.The other complaint-it has 2 female ends . It does n't show that part in the picture but now you 're stuck not being able to make the tracks that you want unless you have a bunch of their specialty pieces . It does n't show in the `` Items that were also bought with this '' the super expensive male/male and female/female pieces.The kids still like using it because it 's a big bridge , but I probably would n't buy it for anyone else.EDITED : Thomas had been put away for a while and has since made a reappearance . We have n't been using the train table ( I recommend not buying one ) so our track layout has been HUGE . We made one and it used 4 loops , the original figure 8 bridge , the coal bridge and this collapsing bridge . Since we 've never had the chance to loop under this bridge ( space constraints of the table , I never noticed we WERE N'T ABLE TO HAVE TRAINS GO UNDER THE BRIDGE ! What ? What good is a bridge if you ca n't have more track go under it ? We propped it up the 1/4 '' with some cardboard pieces but that 's not the point . I feel this was more than a let down , if the kids did n't like this , I 'd have change the rating from 3 stars to 1 instead of just 2 stars . Quality control is less than lacking in this . For the money it is a huge disappointment .	-1
My 7 year daughter was so excited until she did about 5 of the experiments . Not exciting . The funnest part was using the dropper and measuring spoon to measure the ingredients but on the instructions it says things like after adding the ingredients , now you have 2 cups of purple water . Get ready to blow your mind . Add one medium scoop of baking soda to one of the cups and stir it in . It changed color ! I just was n't that impressed and neither was my daughter , I would go with a different kind next time .	-1
Ok not the greatest purchase would ot buy again wish it did more would not buy again not worth it	-1
Manual : Is just a cheap white xerox copy looking print out folded and stapled . With NO pictures . Very few experiments and they are all pretty much the same experiments . All just ways to view the interaction of acids and basics.Hardware supplies : 3 little plastic dixie cups . 3 plastic test tubes with rounded bottoms and no rack to hold them . They want you to put them in a cup to hold them for viewing . They could have at least made the bottoms flat or included a cheap rack to go with the cheap test tubes . 2 straws , a pippet , and 2 measuring spoons that do not have the measurement amounts printed on them , but instead are referred to as the medium and small spoon . No clay or anything to mold a basic volcano . Instead they include a recipe for using flour to make a really bad paste for the volcano.Chemicals : pretty much everything you already have in your kitchen except for the Citric Acid , which you could buy somewhere else or use Vinegar which works better in many of the acid/basic experiments.While I knew when I bought this that the supplies would likely be over priced for this kit . I was expecting that the cost was justified for what I was expecting the manual to be . The manual should have been a nice color experiment book with pictures . And should have been a good collection of experiments that were more than just make colors change and watch the bubbles . Worthless kit . Just google for some simple experiments yourself . You likely have everything in your kitchen already and you will likely find more exciting things to show and teach your kids . I would return this kit if I had a choice .	-1
I only ordered this as my search criteria in Amazon showed that it was `` made in the USA '' and it is not . I will be returning it .	-1
Saw this on Amazon & wish-listed it , went to store because it was cheaper by $ 6 , opened it up before I left store , THANK GOODNESS . Household junk I know is in my kitchen somewhere . Put it back on shelf immediately . Do n't be fooled by cute box .	-1
This is a fun and convenient kit containing some gelatin , sugar , yeast , a balloon , four petri dishes , a magnifying glass , and some red and green food coloring . Also a few pages , perhaps 6 , of projects/instructions.The kids and I are having fun with this , but then I am in education and was a bio major . So that helps.For this to be really worth it , it would be nice if it came with a few more projects , or perhaps an actual book for the kids to read .	-1
My 6 year old got this for his birthday . The petri dishes were ok in concept , but it took so long to a ) put them together and b ) get stuff to grow on them , he lost interest . The experiments do seem a little shabby and boring , not real science at all . Most of the kit is still in the bag in the closet . My son loves `` science '' and is always putting together his own little experiments ( most with no purpose , but hey , he 's 6 ! This was just kindof lame . Meh .	-1
I totally thought my grandsons would adore this as a thing farting and snot are the funniest things on the planet at their age . It did n't take however . I had think that has something to do with the fact that their mother will not allow them to make a mess in the house . I just know they have not mess with it at all since I got it . It was a waste of money	-1
The concept of this kit is great , but the chemicals used to create the volatility of the scents is absolutely hideous and we experienced it as TOXIC . I am not exaggerating . This stuff gave me a terrible headache and I could not be in the same room with it for more than 10 minutes . It is also a very penetrating smell and if any is spilled ( it will be ) it will linger in your rug or furniture for weeks . I honestly believe it is very unhealthy for growing brains to be around these chemicals . Also , the kit does not reveal all the chemicals used , so I do n't know what they were . The scents themselves are not that bad , so it 's unfortunate that the company cheaped out on the volatility base . The kids loved the idea , and wanted to keep all the perfumes and put them on everything , which only made it worse that the two adults in the house reacted badly to these and we had to get rid of all of them .	-1
All the perfumes except for the peppermint smell the same . They need to add some variety to the scents you can create .	-1
I bought this for my 11 year old daughter based on all the excellent reviews , but it 's not that great , in her opinion . Some of the recipes/mixes do not even make a firm enough slime to pick up , just a bowl of gooey glop.And after making two types of slime , she ran out of ingredients . So that 's not too much fun for $ 17+ .	-1
This doll is very poor attempt to bring the movie character to life.It is just your very plain and basic doll . The body is skinny andmade of poor quality plastic , hard to pose , once you pose it looses thebalance and the hands fall down and with time the head will also go into unstopped rotation when touched.The dress is very poor and just so so average.This is one of those dolls that appears much more attractive on the picture then in real life.It is okay for a child as a first doll , starter doll but I would not buy it for someone who knows the difference or wants to hold to the doll for a long while or as a memories or play a lot with it becuase this doll just does not do the job.Once upon a time Disney released limited amount of those dolls in Deluxe version and they are very characteristic and easy to recognise , the Mulan doll in Deluxe version came with accessories - the Mushu dragon , the Dog and the brush for the hair.That doll is out of this world gorgeous . It is sized pretty much like a Barbie doll , more less 12 inches in height or bit more , very solidly build to last doll . We have it and it is just amazing how great it performs over the time it is with us . The posability is amazing , the outfit is layered of many many many different parts it is so much joy to dress that doll , It starts with some sort of kimono with HUGE sleeves and generous amount of fabric all over the place , you put it on first , then you add some sort of another garment that velcroes on the back over the kimono and then you ad yet another belt like thingy on the top of it.. and it is not even haf.. there is another piece that you have to play with and add a fabric of some sort and then you got finally a long and huge wrap ! Just the dress part is like amazing ! The face comes in gorgoeous painted on make up wiht amazing eye shadows.Face expression is just like the doll from the movie.Now for the accessories , it comes with cute figures made of plastic and perfectly sized . they are not cheap ones they are fancy gorgeous figures.The only hard part is to find that Deluxe doll as they made so few of them and Disney sold them out so fast . I see them from time to time but mostly there are those blah dolls that have very plain dresses and they are puffed in very non-traditional style that has nothing to do with character , and if you want original movie character go and find that Deluxe doll : ) that is sucha gem of my chlid 's collection and she plays with it all the time , and when it is on display it looks like million bucks .	-1
Game itself arrived in good condition however , when I tried to determine how to play , the directions were too vague .	-1
The tracks certainly work with all the standard sets ( Thomas , Melissa & Doug etc ) but the clearance for the two tunnels is not high enough for the engines on most if these sets . Which makes it useless for all but the smallest cars/engines . It does work with our ikea set however	-1
This piece may be fine if you have very little track already or have the world 's biggest train table . Otherwise , it is so cumbersome with very little going on . Not worth the space on our table as we have plenty of cooler things to build with . I was hoping it would be more versatile , but it is not . There is a back slope that takes up tons of space and has no track/opening that can be used . I returned it .	-1
This doll is not as good as it looks in the picture.First of all , It was my best friends toy . My best friend was very exited to get this toy and I happended to be at her house when it came in . we where very exited to play with it . after about an hour or two a part in the dress riped . this plush was for some reason `` over stuffed '' her mom took out a little stuffing as we played on . Her mom fixed it but then it ripped again ! ! this time ( I ca n't remember where ) It ripped in a unfixabble spot ! so she had to throw it out she was upset but understood.thent it was three weeks befor her birthday so I got her the sanie one she liked much better.Realy recomend the sanie on better than this one . ( I even went back and bought the sanie one myself )	-1
My grandchildren ( ages 8 & 4 ) just were not interested in this game , and never opened it , even with urging from me . They like lots of other card games & board games , so I do n't know what to think .	-1
My kid loves the animals , but alongside with our brio trains they are incredibly flimsy . Also , there are 3 animals but only 2 slots for them to ride .	-1
this is so tiny it is dangerous for any aged child , and being made inChina , who knows what is in the paint ? they dont regulate and we dont check	-1
I would n't recommend it if you wanted to have good replicas of the animals . The workmanship on these pieces leaves a lot to be desired but guess its a good deal for the price .	-1
Small plastic animals , as a genre , are an excellent toy . My daughter spends a lot of time playing with hers . I ordered these thinking we could do with a few more . But they seem very cheaply made . I sent them back . I recommend you get a couple of Toobs instead -- or , better by far , invest in some Playmobil .	-1
ITS NOT a set of 60 . Its 12 animal 5 times each . There is no way you can make the Ostrich stand . that takes one of . DO NOT BUY THIS ! ! !	-1
My husband and I spent a long time putting this together since it came in about a million pieces and they all had to be cut out and then assembled . And , the quality is pretty bad . The baby bed just snaps together so it comes apart pretty quickly . My daughters love it but I feel like I wasted my money .	-1
Although my girls love this toy , I think it 's cheaply made and has already broke in several places . The concept and idea would be great if it was n't made out of cheap plastic . I 'd even pay more to have it better quality .	-1
I got half way through assembling and the bits started to snap , this is a cheap toy that breaks easily I am contacting the supplier to complain- TOTAL JUNK	-1
We loved this toy for the first day , and then my preschool age kids broke it in the next 24 hours . It does n't hold up to simple dropping and handling . Also , the button did n't seem to work correctly for us . Wish it were more sturdy or we 'd buy more , as it is super fun .	-1
-- Initial Review -- We added this to our Thomas the Train set that was passed down to us . It was our first battery powered train . Our 2 year old son loves it . Batteries went out within a couple of days but that is because he played with it 24/7 . Now batteries last a lot longer since he plays with a few others toys during the day now. -- 2 months after purchase -- This model broke on within the first two months . This train is made by Learning Curve who is no longer in business . Fisher Price now owns these trains and who sells them . I recommend buying the Fisher Price model because if it does happen to break they will replace no questions asked .	-1
I thought this would be perfect for my toddler . The first few times it was great - easy to push and rolled on the carpet . After the first day , it stopped working . If you pushed it down , it made a clicking noise and did n't work . I returned it .	-1
I ca n't believe I spent what I did on this just to have it break after a day : ( Soooo very disappointed . Like another reviewer , mine just makes a succession of clicks after pushing it down , going back to its original position , and does n't & # 34 ; go & # 34 ; anywhere . Even if it *did* work , I really do n't think it 's worth almost twenty dollars . It 's more like a ten buck type of toy in my opinion .	-1
Actual product is only 8 buckets inside of the shape sorter bucket , instead of the 10 , plus holder described in product description . Numbers are 1-8 , not 1-10 . It only stacks to 2 feet , not 3 feet as stated.The box had the right information , but this page does not . I can only assume the company cut back to save money . I would rather teach my toddlers to count to 10 , not stop at 8.Also , on the box it says great bath toy and great for sprinkle activities . Then it says , `` Do not immerse in water . `` My 17 month old twins ( who have no trouble taking the tops off their sippy cups ) needed help getting the top of the shape sorter.Also , the biggest bucket is no bigger than my hand . I thought it would at least be the size of a regular sand pail.There are many other stacking products that you can immerse in water , that you actually get 10 of , and that are cheaper than this one . I plan to return this and notify Amazon of the incorrect description .	-1
We got these because my son 's preschool teacher recommended them , but then someone else bought him Magformers , which are waaay better . These tend to fall apart more easily and the big problem with them is hard to explain , but here goes : they are straight-edged with 90-degree corners , which ( with the tendency to fall apart ) makes it difficult to build more complex shapes , like regular polyhedrons . The other day , my son and I made a regular icosohedron out of magformers and it even withstood a little tossing around , and that would never happen with these . Because of the shape , they fit together best at right angles to each other . I would skip these and get magformers instead .	-1
I purchased this 8 '' rainmaker for my 1 year old for christmas after some pretty great reviews . I am pretty disappointed overall . Because of the size the small beads inside do n't have very far to fall therefore making little noise . You actually have to shake the toy to get the rest to fall and it does n't sound much like rain when you shake it . I also purchased the 16 '' for my little sister and I would definitely recommend that you purchase the larger one as they were only a couple dollars more .	-1
this does NOT live up to reviews . It is what it is . a toy with little balls inside . My daughter does n't play with it besides a quick shake here and there and neither do my other kids . I would much rather have picked out something else for her . sorry , did n't work for us . One of those `` bad buys '' that the kid will never play with .	-1
takes forever to fill up with air , then even though it was fully inflated the kids would compress it enough by sitting on it that they would n't really slide at all ( the whole point ) . Also the picture on the outside of the box is a grotesque misrepresentation of its size .	-1
When I bought this new through Amazon I thought it would come with more than one character . It came with one little person - the driver . But what really disappointed me was that the wheels do not turn . It 's as if the wheels are too light to turn . It 's weird . Very disappointed ! Usually little people toys are good quality for the money . I would not recommend this bus .	-1
We LOVE Melissa and Doug , but these paints were terrible . The first day we used them , they were great -- vibrant , pretty colors . After that , they turned into a thick , gummy mess . I 've never had watercolors do this before ( and we go through a LOT of them at my house ) . We had to throw them away because my son could n't paint with the thick mess . These were terrible !	-1
My 2.5 Year Old daughter got this last xmas . we figured that punching the buttons would entertain her on a LONG car trip for Christmas . She could still care less . She is obsessed with our laptop , but does n't like this one . The mouse is very annoying , its too easy to switch games and modes so when she does play with it , its just annoying . We are going to try getting her the leap frog one this year . I even tried putting it away for 6 months , and still she could care less . But she 's not really into electronic toys in general .	-1
My son plays with my Acer tablet all the time and I have apps for him . We received this toy as a present recently . It does not compare to the tablet graphics/ease of use/and versatility.Tablets are much more pricey . But I wanted one for myself and as a huge bonus he loves it as well.If you want to invest in a tablet for yourself I suggest getting some apps for you toddler and skip type of purchase.Preschool monkey lunchbox app is awesome .	-1
I got this over a year ago I think & the kids really do not play with it at all . The screen is to small . You can not turn the sound off . The same song plays over and over and over . They tried it a couple times and did not like it at all Waste of money .	-1
Although this computer takes a beating - it is not appropriate for a child . The screen is black and small and nearly everything must be done using the mouse - not something a two year old finds easy.On top of getting frustrated by the mouse on this computer - the music and noise are equally annoying .	-1
I have posted elsewhere , but feel I should post this again : I just received a response from the company that to me is subpar given that these toys are in the mouths and hands of babies and children and contain BPA and PVC . I 've read the research on both materials and conclude that I do n't want my child to be exposed to either , especially on a daily basis . As these items are made in China and not rigorously tested , I am afraid to know what goes under the radar . I also feel this glut of cheap , plastic material is not good for the earth .	-1
This laptop is a big disappointment for me . As a parent of a 4 year old I find this a poor choice at any age . The keyboard has the letters ordered across in alphabetical order , not as real keyboards are . This I strongly feel is going to confuse children of 3 years or up for their future use of computers . This perhaps is okay for children 18 months to no older than 36 months . Mouse also is not accurate but works . The graphics are very poor as others stated and difficult to see since not lit at all . Even the audio is poor . It is garbled enough that we can not determine if the man said c , e , b or d because you it all sounds the same just something eeee . Can not tell if it is bah eee , da eee , sss eee etc.Not something I would recommend for child of any age .	-1
Bought this for my 3 1/2 year-old son for Christmas . My kids always get to open one present on Christmas Eve , and since a marshmallow gun is what he specifically asked for this year , we let him open it . Straight out of the box , it did not hold air pressure . My ( very handy ) boyfriend was able to fix the issue more or less , but unless they 're the perfect size and shape , the large marshmallows get stuck in the barrel . I even took the advice of some other reviewers and let the marshmallows sit out so they were n't so squishy , and we also refrigerated some as well . We were all very disappointed with this toy , and it 's getting returned . Guess we 'll just stick to Nerf guns from now on .	-1
There are so many matching games out there , but I always loved the duck game at the fare and so do my kids . That is why I chose this one , but I found some issues right away . This game is simple and easy enough for little ones to play . It teaches matching and also shape recognition . The flaws are that you will never get this back in the box after opening it because of the way it is packed at the factory . You have to store the little ducks somewhere else . This toy is also really loud and incessant . It annoys even my 4-year-old .	-1
This game is simple and easy for a preschooler to play but it keeps quacking the entire game . And if you stack another game on top of it it can also start quacking in the box . I played this a few times with my preschooler but decided to get rid of it because it is so annoying . Plus , my younger child takes the ducks and carries them around the house . Hard to play when you are missing a duck . If you are looking for a game that works on colors and shapes I 'd go for Cranium Hullabaloo instead . It makes noise to for some reason is MUCH less annoying . And has an off button .	-1
For whatever reason ( broken , I guess ) ours never quacked . From reading the other reviews , I guess my version was actually enhanced : ) The motor is still really loud , though.I bought this because my 3yo son loves Pick Up Ducks at the carnivals . This game should be called `` Knock Over Ducks '' . The first duck that gets knocked over , usually jams up the game , causing the other ducks to pile up and fall over behind it . It quickly turns into a free-for-all grabfest , with any notion of turns dropped.Definitely not my favorite game- Noisy- Ducks fall over and ruin the gameplay- Box is disposable , so you 'll need to store the ducks somewhere ... or lose them in the tub , sandbox , yard etc.Not the worst game ( that goes to the Pizza tipping game we got ) , but definitely nowhere near the best .	-1
Why must so many childrens ' games be so loud and annoying ? Great game sans the quacking of the ducks ... quacking of the ducks ... . quacking of the ducks .	-1
I had a circus theme b-day party & used these as & # 34 ; pick the ducky from the pond for a prize & # 34 ; game . Pitiful - they did n't even float !	-1
We got 3 dozens different rubber ducks from Amazon and this group is the worst dozen . The paint feels like it is not completely dried and it rubbed off on the bodies of the ducks . Also , these ducks do not quack/squeak because the blow hole is not on the bottom , it is where the mouth is ; these ducks are more like water squirters .	-1
I did not like this product , it is just one and for the purpose that I bought it as an instrument for my daughters to sing along , it is not even worthy . It seems cheap .	-1
Adorable maraca , but sold individually , and who sells maracas individually ? I ended up paying $ 20.00 for a pair ! Cute , but the Melissa & Doug product is a better deal , and they are bigger too .	-1
My daughter and I loved the look but these are are made of such soft wood that they got badly dented withing 5 minutes of play .	-1
This cat has really bizarre eyes that scare the grandchildren . They will not play with it let alone take it to bed with them to cuddle . They look almost evil .	-1
I thought mini would be smaller than a regular beach ball or small ball ... . but these are micro-mini and will fit in the palm of your hand . Not sure about the 5 & # 34 ; measurement as described because these are super small and not close to 5 & # 34 ; .	-1
Units are in inches does not identify the exact size bought.Fortunately , my kids like 18 months.This ball joints without the dapper , packaging and the ball is in the black dirt and dust.The slight smell.Is proportional to the product price and quality .	-1
We have gone through ( operative words `` gone through '' ) tons of remote control vehicles over the years . This one was mediocre at best . The main thing is that it was n't that well made , so it did n't last long , even for a remote control vehicle . Circles are fine , I suppose , but we could n't get this to go straight after the first few uses . The battery issue was a non-issue for us , as we use rechargeables for everything . AND we 're not talking about rough use , certainly not even what it was advertised to do . But it just did n't want to hang in there for very long , and even after being given a fix-up by Grandpa , it was not very cooperative.As a side note , if you 're going to give it a try ( and many people got ones that operated fine ) , then make sure it 's for a younger child , no older than 5 or 6 at the most . Does n't last that long , and does n't do that much . Would have delighted a 3 or 4 year old , though . ( with an adult `` helping '' to operate it , and assuming you get one that works for longer than ours did ) .	-1
I was worried from the beginning when I received a banged up brown cardboard box with the car and remote thrown in plastic bags inside . No packaging . No instructions . Nothing . I removed the car and it was covered in dust . My first thought was that it was used , but after inspecting the wheels , I do n't think it was because they were perfect.I put batteries in the remote and let my son play with it . At first it was fun . He ran it around the house and then outside , but within about an hour , the remote stopped working . Changing batteries did no good at all . Save your money .	-1
While this toy has n't broken for me yet , I can tell that it is very cheaply made , and it 's probably just a matter of time ... As for it 's capabilities , it does what it says it does . My 7-year old enjoyed racing it around , and we , too , ran it in the bathtub , which was a bit more bother than it was worth , but still , it was pretty neat to have an r/c vehicle in the bathtub water ! I agree with other reviewers who say to get this for a young kid who will either break it on his/her own , or lose interest , as young children tend to do . It is not durable enough to become a favorite toy of an older child , nor does its performance rise to the level of that bar .	-1
Poorly made . There are unacceptable gaps and rough edges between the pieces . Mine came with scratches , stray paint marks , and greasy finger prints . The on/off switch keeps falling off.I am sure this is not properly waterproofed for an electrical toy and draining the water out of the hull is difficult . The drain holes mentioned in the instructions do not exist.The communication with the transmitter even at close distances is poor resulting in erratic behavior.The car moves the same way a tank does ; the right side wheels move forward or backward together . The same is true for the left . They are not proportional speed . They are either in forward , reverse , or off . Surprisingly , you ca n't spin in place ( right side forward and left side backward , or vice versa ) . When you set the controls to this , it only moves the side going forward.When not stuttering along , it moves fairly well on carpet , hard floors , and grass . In sand , it digs four holes for each wheel and wont move . It does transition from shore to water well , but in the water it does't steer well and is easily swept away by even a gentle current . The erratic connection with the transmitter is especially frustrating in water .	-1
When I pulled the Morphibian from the box , I was initially impressed with what seemed to be it 's hardy appearance . However , when I inspected the hand held remote , I was a bit dismayed by it 's bent antannae and very skimpy feel . The batteries are easily installed - typical removal of a philipps screw and typical AA & AAA battery installation . Yes , you need both types for this toy to work : 3 AAs for the vehicle , and 2 AAAs for the remote . A bit inconvenient right from the go . I actually read the `` manual '' which was only a piece of paper about 4.25 x 11 folded in half , printed on both sides . Most of the instructions were common sense warnings not pertaining to the actual operation of the Morphibian . The remote must be held in both hands and has dual controls , Left & Right . Moving both forward makes the vehicle go forward , both backwards brings it into reverse . Turning is a difficult attempt of moving one forward or backward or each control in opposite directions . The turning of the vehicle was difficult for my kids ( aged between 7-12 ) - even I had difficulty until I got the hang of it . The power of the Morphibian was impressive for such a little vehicle . On our hardwood floors it zipped across the floor quite quickly . It was fun to spin it around and maneuver it around obstacles . On semi-shag carpeting it slowed as would be expected . There was an immediate hesitation that was consistent through the operation of the Morphibian . It appears that there is not good contact in the handheld remote . We would push the controls forward and it seemed to be hesitant and than it would run for a while . I think over time this will only get worse and is pretty typical of other reviews that I 've read . Probably the coolest part of the toy is it 's ability to go through water . I placed it in the bathtub and slowly raised the water to right over the tire level . While the tub was filling to that point , the Morphibian would easily maneuver through the water . Once it floated free of contact with the tub , however , it became difficult to control . I found as long as I kept the wheels in contact with the tub surface , the vehicle would push through the water with no problem . I then put the Morphibian through one more test : snow . I live in the Midwest and we are experiencing a blizzard currently , so I took the toy outside to see how it would handle the elements . There was about 2 '' of snow on the driveway and the Morphibian just could n't get good enough traction to move . It is good to be reminded that it made no such claims either.So , overall - knowing now what I do about the toy , I probably would n't purchase one for my own use or for my kids use . It just does n't perform well consistently . It is fun when it did perform , but just not enough to rank more than 2 stars .	-1
The idea of a remote control vehicle that can drive on land and float on water is great . However , this product is not worth the purchase price . One , packaging , vehicle , and remote control all feel cheap and the flimsy . Two , batteries were NOT included . Three , the remote control is not intuitive , and is buggy . Four , it does n't work well in water . Five , similar to other review , the remote control flakes out after less than 2 weeks .	-1
This is a cool-looking toy and , based on the description of what it is does and cool look , my son was super-excited to try it out . While he 's below the age-range this is aimed at , he was using it with his dad , and is a remote-control pro , having successfully used a large variety of remote-control toys , including things like helicopters that are also rated well above his age range.That being said , this was tricky for him to maneuver , as the control unit is non-intuitive . Even my husband had trouble getting a feel for it and , once they did , were disappointed in the slow speed and lack of maneuverability this supposedly `` amphibious '' unit possessed . Trying to use it outdoors was basically a no-go , as less than an inch of snow stymied it . Inside , on flat ( uncarpeted ) surfaces , it still could gain little speed and lost `` sight '' of its remote control unit in as little as 10-15 feet away from the user . A much shorter distance than other remote control toys we 've used.Still , it was only mildly disappointing until day three when , like others I see here , our control unit stopped working on one side only . Just would n't function at all , despite no damage or mis-use of the product . That , combined with the fact that this is a battery hog even for a remote control toy , means I ca n't recommend this one , at all .	-1
I bought this puzzle for my 17-month-old son because he loves to play with an earlier version of it at our local library . Although the one at the library is a bit worn from many little hands playing with it , it 's a beautiful puzzle . Each piece is painted all the way around with bright colors , and the edges around each piece are smooth.The puzzle we just received seems like a cheap knock off . The puzzle background and pieces are not painted , but decorated with stick-on designs . The stick-on only covers the front of each puzzle piece , so the edges and back are just plain plywood ( not nice quality wood like the puzzle at the library ) . I absolutely do not believe that it is handmade.All this being said , my son does love the puzzle . He 's too little to notice the huge difference in quality and he 's totally obsessed with vehicles . For that reason alone I wo n't be returning it - but I also wo n't be buying another new Melissa & Doug puzzle.As a helpful hint to parents out there looking for puzzles , I did manage to find a very high quality Melissa & Doug dinosaur puzzle at our local thrift shop . That 's probably the only way to get a good quality puzzle from this company , by finding an older version of a puzzle that has been sold to a thrift store.// Edit : 7.28.11 After finding a hand-painted Melissa & Doug puzzle at a local kid 's store I decided to call Melissa & Doug to see what the story is . Turns out they have changed the way their puzzles are made . All of them are the plain-backed plywood variety now . So the only way to find a good-quality puzzle like they used to make is to search the thrift stores or find one on a fluke at your local store/online . The one I found at our kids store was probably from an older inventory . It 's too bad because the older puzzles with pieces that are painted all the way around serve as both puzzles and stand-alone play pieces .	-1
Do NOT buy any more Melissa and Doug products ! They used to be of high quality , but now are cheaply made in China . This puzzle is not real wood , and is simply wood over MDF or particle board , which is known to contain formaldehyde . Within seconds of unwrapping this item , the paint was chipping off and the `` wood '' inside starting coming out , and sawdust was everywhere . These products have been linked to toxic levels of lead-we must stand up for our children and demand that children 's toys be made with higher standards . The USA has lower standards than Europe and even Canada-this company is only concerned with their bottom line . Buy toys from natural , trustworthy companies like Haba , Under the Nile , Green Toys , Hape , and many others . The prices are not that different , and your child 's health is worth it . After emailing this company , they are very careful of their wording and do not actually state that their products do n't contain toxic chemicals . They simply say that their standards meet the USA toy standards-not enough of a reassurance to me . Also , this puzzle states that it is for 3 years and up , which is crazy . It 's because their products are toxic and they know that younger babies will put things in their mouths ... I do n't want my kids playing with things that are n't safe to chew on . Do some research of your own and you 'll be shocked , as I was .	-1
This toy is fun . The farm animals are super cute . It 's a great concept for a 'first ' puzzle , with it 's bright fun animals and easy-match puzzle board . It is certainly educational , and when I bought it I felt pretty good about my kids playing with it.I bought this puzzle expecting it to be precisely what was advertised : A wooden puzzle . Naive to the world of children 's toys , I took that description at face value . When I think wooden , I think solid wood , which is what these pieces appear to be . They have a nice heavy feel to them , and when thoroughly coated in paint , considering the false advertising , you 'd really have no reason to expect otherwise.Enter time and a little rough tossing around of the puzzle pieces , and as the paint begins to chip away , another story is revealed . These puzzle pieces are nothing but pressed paper-like sawdust material . When revealed beneath the chipped-off paint , this dry , dusty substance easily flakes off where it can get into little mouths and become part of the general household dust.Okay , so Melissa and Doug fudged a little on their description . What might have been wood once upon a time is now thinly pressed layers of sawdust and resin , but it was wood in a previous life , and that still counts , right ? It 's intentionally deceptive marketing , but does any of that really matter in the practical sense ? I think it does.Medium density fiberboard ( MDF ) is nasty stuff . Containing a higher resin-to-wood ration than any other pressed wood product , MDF emits VOCs for at least a few months after manufacture and emits urea formaldehyde for the duration of its life . I doubt there have been any studies on using pressed wood for a child 's toy that may be mouthed and is nonetheless handled frequently and in close proximity to their faces during day-to-day play . There have been studies suggesting urea formaldehyde is a suspected carcinogen ; others show that incidences of leukemia and lymphoma increase through prolonged exposure of VOCs in the indoor environment.Bottom line , most MDF is not something you want in your home in any form , and it 's probably not the best thing to make a child 's toy out of . There are ways to manufacture MDF which use resins that do not contain formaldehyde which are supposed to be environmentally friendly . I contacted Melissa and Doug to find out if they use these formaldehyde-free resins in their MDF . They 've got really friendly customer service , but no one available could provide me with that information . I was told they 'd get back to me . I 'm still waiting.In the meantime , I think I 'll just stick with the old adage : You get what you pay for.I think the important part is knowing what you 're getting when you decide to purchase it and not being led falsely into believing you 're paying for superior materials when you 're really just buying a few adorable cubes or formaldehyde-imbued garbage coated thickly in conveniently concealing paint . Had this been disclosed in the description , I 'd have no gripe with this puzzle . I also would not have purchased it to begin with.There are solid wood ( and plywood ) puzzles out there . They cost anywhere from 2 to 3 times as much as a Melissa and Doug 'wooden ' puzzle ( sometimes more ) , but most have the added bonus of not being made in China ; a small detail of Melissa and Doug 's toys that has always sent a red flag of sorts up for me .	-1
I was so excited to get this puzzle for my little ones . Unfortunately , the item description is misleading . The puzzle looks nice ( before the kids get to it ) and the chunky pieces were a perfect size ! However , this puzzle is NOT hand painted . The puzzle pieces are just faced with a sticker , that easily comes off ( in pieces ! ) . That is not the quality I was expecting , especially from Melissa and Doug . I 've had the puzzle for 2 months now , and 2 or 3 of the pieces have the stickers mostly peeled off .	-1
This puzzle is by no means wood . Nor is it hand painted . It is mdf board and really cheaply made . I was surprised by all the positive reviews here as this puzzle literally started falling apart within minutes of my son playing with it . The paper like stickers on the puzzle pieces started deteriorating right away . I am not exaggerating when I say within minutes of opening and playing with this puzzle . This puzzle is junk .	-1
This puzzle would be great if it were made well . It 's not . It 's made very poorly actually . The picture on the board is not wooden , but painted on a piece of paper , which started peeling off immediately . The paint on the animals is low quality , as it started chipping off after about a week . Not something you want in a child toy . Pretty disappointed .	-1
This looks nice and I was exited when it arrived . However , the pieces look like particle board and the animal stickers come off too easily . It 's almost like the picture just melts off . Compared to other toys , this puzzle just does n't hold up to regular use by a toddler . My daughter is not overly hard on her toys . All my Plan Toys still look great , sadly , not Melissa and Doug . Save your money .	-1
I got this puzzle free with diaper points so I suppose I should n't complain , but I will . From the sound of it , I got the `` better '' version of this puzzle - the pieces are painted , but the board is not . It 's printed paper glued to layers of wood laminate , but it seems only the perimeter was glued . In the center you can lift the paper right off ( and tear it , which we did within minutes . ) I tried to fix it with Elmer 's glue but I could n't get it into all the little curves and I 'm not sure I 'm helping . Very poor construction for a toddler toy . I have one other Melissa & Doug product , the `` talking '' animal puzzle , which I do n't like because the sounds are not linked to the pictures ( wave the horse over the bird photo and you 'll hear it chirp - how confusing . ) This mom is not a Melissa & Doug fan .	-1
If you 're looking for more zombies for Zombies , sure , buy it . But if you 're looking for generic zombie miniatures , these zombies are on the small 25mm side . I have n't tried painting these , but the lack of detail and soft plastic does n't look encouraging . Zombicide has much better urban zombies , and Reaper Miniatures has its zombies from its plastic Bones miniature line . Both are higher priced , but much better quality .	-1
This was a Christmas gift for my daughter . Within just weeks , the mobile has broke , the ribbons have broke and the base broke . Even had these things not broken , it 's really low quality . I wish I could send it back .	-1
I bought this crib for my 2 year old daughter . When I tried to assemble it I realized that it 's defective . The holes where the screws were supposed to be inserted were drilled way too wide . And it was n't just one corner of the crib , it was all four corners therefore it was completely unfixable . I called the company , but they were closed . They are only open Monday-Thursday and this was Friday . Needless to say my daughter was disappointed , and I had to return the item to the store . I wonder how many defective cribs they shipped this holiday season ! Interestingly enough , they include a flyer that if a product is defective to please call them and not contact the seller . After seeing the poor quality of this product I would not risk buying from this company again . I had just bought the Melissa and Doug high chair , which was a breeze to set up . The reason I went with this crib vs. the Melissa and Doug is that this one has storage underneath . I guess now I might reconsider .	-1
This game is SO long ! It 's my least favorite to play , my son , almost 7 , does really like it though.. but it 's my least favorite to play . We change the rules a lot during the game , which is annoying , we do n't do that with any other game . Maybe if we play with 2 players it would be better , but with 4 players , it 's takes so long to play ...	-1
Nothing is less fun than a headless Woody doll . Wish it had lasted a bit longer , but after a few weeks , the head came off with casual play , too . Will have to inspect products like this instore before buying .	-1
Thought it would be more interactive yet the hat barely stays on and looks like a cheap version of what it should be . My husband was even disappointed and he rarely cares about toys . Would not buy this again . You can barely hear the doll even speak when you pull the string and the color of his skin is so yellow I wonder if it 's even the real one or a cheap version being passed off as the real thing .	-1
I gave the doll to my son for his birthday . he pulled the string and it can out . a few days later he droped it and one of the fingers snap off . and almost a week later . he drop it and the boot snapped off . got money back .	-1
I am teaching all of my children to play something as part of their musical education . I let each kid choose what they want to learn to play . I was getting these for my 12yr old daughter who wanted to learn to play spoons . Bad idea . We ended up not using them because they are so bad . These things are VERY cheaply made . The metal is very thin & weak and bends way too easily . They also sound tinny , weak and pathetic . If you are looking for a kid 's toy , these might be fun for a toddler or something , but probably not.After seeing how bad these are , I searched Youtube for `` Spoons '' and found some great tutorials on how to use regular old kitchen spoons . Regular kitchen spoons are solidly made , sound great , are very easy to hold , easy to learn to play and cost nothing . If you do n't want to beat up your good stuff , go to the store and buy 2 spoons for $ 1 . The difference in sound is very noticable . These Trophy things sound horrible , are hard to play , and really are n't worth buying . We have found that playing real spoons is enjoyable for kids/adults of any age . Trying to play these is not fun at all , and can be downright frustrating trying to get them to work like real spoons , they just do n't compare.The point is , if you want to use these as a rhythm instrument , or for elementary education , and not just as a toy , do n't use these . Put in the extra 2minutes for a youtube search and see the difference real spoons make and then just use those .	-1
Do n't bother if you wants these spoons to actually play music . They are n't balanced correctly and do n't make the right sound .	-1
The product is great because we are lego fans . The packaging is great but when my son open the item the corner of the one plate was damage .	-1
I gave this to our 2 year old daughter for Christmas and it overtook her 'lovey bear ' , which now sits neglected on her dresser lol . She absolutely LOVES this `` doggy '' and its everything I can do to just give him a bath . In spite of all the loves , however , its hair has matted most spectacularly , and we already have a hole wearing in it 's front left armpit , and we only gave it to her not six months ago . It starts off adorable , and in spite of being machine washable , I would n't recommend it if you like it 's hair the way it is . I heard someone put theirs in a pillowcase before washing it , and maybe that makes the difference . My experience is it will be much loved , no matter what , but if you like your kid carrying around a fluffy border collie , and not one that looks like it 's in a constant state of a bad hair day , I 'd go for the meadow border collie or one of the other shorter haired plushes .	-1
I bought it for my daughter for Christmas one year . We were trying to help her talk more , and she did n't really like it . My son ended up playing with it more than her . All in all it broke pretty quickly , so not really a great toy for children under 10 . Could see it being nice as a novelty for adults though .	-1
We received this as a gift when my son was 9 months old . At that age , he could easily remove the pieces by grabbing the knobs , but he still constantly chewed on his toys and this puzzle does NOT stand up to any sort of moisture . The colored design easily peels off if a baby chews it or if you attempt to wash it . Even after trying to wash it , there 's also still sawdust on the unfinished edges of this puzzle which gets everywhere despite frequently wiping it down . Finally , the pieces are cut unevenly -- some of the pieces that should be symmetrical are not ( e.g . in our puzzle , the square can not be inserted in any direction , which I imagine would be frustrating for a toddler ! ) . My son is now 14 months old and loves the toy -- he loves to carry the pieces around , bang them together like cymbals , and has figured out how to insert the circle piece ( which is cut evenly enough to insert in any direction ) . We just have to watch him to make sure he does n't chew on it . This would be a wonderful toy if the manufacturers could address some of these quality issues !	-1
I purchased this and a couple other M & D ; knob puzzles because after receiving one as a gift , my son was hooked . Initially they seemed great : Made of wood , large pieces with large knobs to hold on to , seemed fairly heavy-weight ( and durable ) .Over time , though , they just have n't continued to impress me . Yes , the puzzles are thick and the pieces seem sturdy -- but if my son got overly enthusiastic and banged a puzzle piece down ( hitting the base with an edge ) , a dent would form . If he chewed on the pieces , the paper the image is printed on would start to peel/degrade . And every time he removed a puzzle piece , the friction would cause some of the edges of the puzzle to & # 34 ; shed , & # 34 ; leaving a sawdusty residue . Why ? Because this puzzle is NOT solid wood . The parts that look solid on the surface are a paper veneer , the backing is MDF , and the layers the puzzle pieces are made of also seem to be some sort of MDF or wood composite.So yes , these are fairly inexpensive , widely available , and pleasing for young kids . But I do n't think they 're worth it in the long run . I 've had much better experiences with Hape 's peg puzzles , and I would recommend them highly .	-1
I got this today . My Toddler loved it and immediately started playing . After 2 hours only , the sticker on the triangle was coming off at corners . Literally disintegrating . That is cheap craftsmanship ! I was all set to buy more but not now . Go with another brand .	-1
This is my fourth chunky puzzle . One used , one as a gift a year ago , and two recent acquisitions including this one . On the older ones , the pieces are painted all around and the quality is wonderful . The used one is years old and still looks great . On the newer ones , as other reviewers said ... just some cheap stick-on on the front , it is not painted on the sides or back . My son chews on them occasionally and it actually starts to come off . And what 's worse , two pieces on this transportation puzzle are cut inaccurately and have to be practically crammed into the puzzle.Melissa and Doug should be ashamed of themselves ... trading on their good name and reputation and slowly cheaping down their product , expecting us not to notice .	-1
Although Amazon shipped this much quicker than I expected , it is not what was pictured nor what Melissa & Doug used to sale . I have a number of Melissa & Doug puzzles that are painted on ALL sides . The older puzzles are made of real wood and feel much nicer than this pressed board crap . They are also cut to the image where the newer puzzles are mere outlines , haphazardly thrown together . I would have promptly returned this puzzle , but my 19 month old son really loves puzzles and saw this and the other 2 puzzles as they were coming out of the box . I can not believe that these cost the same amount or more than the other puzzles we own , yet they are of such an inferior quality that I can not believe the are trying to pawn it off as the same thing they used to sale . Shame on you Melissa & Doug .	-1
This toy is strange because when you press a button on her leg , her skirt spins around and lights up . The skirt gets hung up easily . I think this is gimmicky . My daughter ( 6 ) loves the 12 Dancing Princesses movie but prefers to play with regular Barbie 's and never chooses this one .	-1
The cage was broken by the 4yr old pretty soon after it arrived . The song is very short too . That 's a shame , it 's expensive . I ca n't fix the cage , so we just have the bottom without the top on now . It 's not a good toy for a child , the song is too short for an adult to be interested , it 's not beautifully made enough to hold an adults interest either .	-1
The pictures are too busy and confusing . I gave up trying to use them with the children . The oldest is four , so perhaps these will be more useful when she is older . I did try using just a few sets at a time and teaching her what to look for in each picture .	-1
We have had ours less than a week and my son ( who is 3 ) dropped it on our carpet floor and it looks like it was rolled over by a truck ... Disappointed .	-1
We have this toy in a `` boy '' version . The main problem : it has a lot of small pieces ( arms , legs ) with VERY sharp corners . The manufacturer made no effort at all to round corners . I have never seen a puzzle with such sharp , dangerous elements . Some of them are like long thin wooden knives . I would not want to live an active child with this thing alone . Notice that the `` recommended age '' is 4 . Perhaps a 4 y/o would have no problem with dangerous pieces , but s/he would also have no interest in such a simple toy . The realistic age of a kid 's interest is 2.5 to 3.5 y/o . For that age , the toy is simply dangerous . Also , `` educational '' part is silly . A kid old enough to understand what it means to have muscles on top of organs will have no interest in playing this toy . The `` educational '' value of seeing a skeleton and then lungs is mostly lost on a 2.5 y/o .	-1
Do n't waste your money . All this toy will do is frustrate your child because it constantly falls apart . The seller I used was just as bad too , this item was damaged during shipping and seller told me `` If they think it 's damaged , only then would I be refunded ! '' In addition to that , I was to pay for return and re-ship if no refund was given ... HUH ? ? ? ? ... too much of a risk in my opinion . Anyway ... ..the wheels do not stay on , the door falls off , I could go on but you get the idea . Look for a better product and save yourself the aggrivation .	-1
There are much better games available . Go to BoardGameGeek.com to see the best rated games.I owned Battle of the Sexes : Simpsons edition and it was complete garbage . As far as I can tell the other games in the series are very similar . The questions are stupid and not fun . The game mechanics are terrible . The game takes FOREVER and does n't play fair at all . Forever meaning it took 2 hours and we were only barely halfway through . We did n't even finish the game .	-1
In my neighborhood , we get together 2 - 3 times monthly for a game night . We play with people ranging from 12 - 45 years old . The kinds of games we love are Scattergories , Taboo , Guesstures , Smart A** , Sort It Out , Catch 22 , Uno , card games , etc . I am usually the supplier of all the board games , since I am kind of obsessed with them and have probably well over 100 games . My husband and I decided to try this game out ahead of the game night because it 's difficult to figure out how to play a new game with a house full of people and kids ( chaos ) . Good thing ! Within 5 minutes we decided that we really hated this game . The answers to probably 80 % of the questions are incredibly obscure ( almost no one , man or woman , would be able to answer them ) or either really , really easy . ( BTW , both my husband and I are college-educated and not dumb people . ) Our reaction after playing for only a few minutes was that we disliked this game intensely , so intensely , in fact , that we both agreed immediately to put this game into the Goodwill pile so as not to subject our friends to a game that we know could n't possibly provide any fun or entertainment to any of them on our cherished game nights . BTW , I got this game on clearance for less than ten smackers and it was perhaps the worst ten smackers I have ever spent . There are TONS of better games out there . If I were you , I would only give this a try if it was free . Maybe not even then .	-1
I was debating getting this doll for my daughter . I definitely wanted an interacting doll and this seemed to be the one I was leaning on . She is on the low side moneywise compared to Amanda and seems a lot cuter . Her voice is very cute , better then Amanda and Baby Alive . I needed to get her myself to check her out . After playing with the doll , I decided to return it . These are the reasons : The doll has fabric legs that in my opinion will get dirty after awhile . I prefer movable plastic legs that you can clean if needed.Because of the the fabric legs you can not dress this doll in any other clothes . No fun at all which leads to kid getting bored of it quicker.Also because of the fabric legs , this doll does not sit up on its own . It needs to be propped into a corner or in a highchair to actually sit up on its own . That would be fine if it was an infant but this is a toddler who requests to `` eat '' and `` play '' and it would be nice if it could sit up and play . She seems more like a talking stuffed animal.The doll moves her arms too much . It seems like everytime the doll says a phrase the arms are moving up and down . Cute at first , annoying after awhile.Personally I thought this doll was way too small for my child 's age ( 5yrs old ) I just wanted something a little bigger . I think this doll is much better for the preschool age girls - age 2-4yrs old . Girls that can not really dress a baby doll yet but would like the doll to talk . I think for girls 5yrs and up , Baby Alive is the better pick . She is a little bigger , says more things and has more facial movements , you can dress her , feed her and change her diapers . Personally , I can see my daughter using Baby Alive much more . Amanda seemed to costly for me and too many bad reviews . So Baby Alive got my pick . After Christmas , I will see how my daughter feels .	-1
This toy came down to just $ 10 in the post Christmas sales last year ... for that it is worth it , but I paid almost full price when this first came out and oh , what a waste ! My little one liked it ... but the quality was simply awful ! It 's cheap plastic that has the tendancy to pop apart frequently ! The slide falls off , the doors stopped worked at once and would not remain shut ! The high chair falls to pieces regularly and is very difficult to get a toy in and out of . The little deocrative pieces also refuse to stay on.Its cute for a little girl to play with and imagine they are a mommy ... but once you have used the slide , fed baby and put baby on a potty -there is little room for additional activity . Thank goodness for the power of imagination as my little girl used this as a fort and hideaway more than the actual intended use ! She struggled to use this without help as all the pieces would fall off mid play requiring an adult or older sibling to jump in and reassemble ! This could have been a lot better quality - but it is this aspect that lets this down the most !	-1
Everyone else did a nice job recapping all the functions and accessories that come with the machine , so I 'll skip that . My one complaint about the microwave is that the door is hard to open and close . I 'm an adult and have to hold the microwave with both hands and really put some `` oomph '' into it . I 'm surprised that a toy for young children is n't made to open and the shut the door easily . Now , unless I have a defective unit , this toy requires too much dexterity and fine motor skills for my 18 month old to manuever alone . She like to push the button and watch the microwave turn on ... that is REALLY cool . But she ca n't play with it by herself . Booo . = (	-1
I got this originally for my 5 year old who is now 12 . He played with about 20 minutes then its over and forgotten about . Then we had two more kids , a boy and a girl . Girl is 6 now and boy 5 . Same deal they pretty much think awesome ... .for 20 minutes then forgotten about . It does n't keep kids attention very long . To me it seems like a such a cool toy but the proof is in the pudding as they say and I have now tried it on all three kids and its a no-go , now headed for yard sale or sale online . Very disappointed in , considering the price . Keep your money and keep looking . All three of my kids have loved legos and the little lego action figures . We would have done much better getting legos instead of this . Same for the Robosapien , we tried it too and for our kids neither one was a hit . If you do decide to try it and your kids do n't play with it much , do n't keep it like I did thinking maybe 'later ' they will play with it more because mine never did .	-1
My kids received this as a Christmas present . It did n't work straight out of the box . My husband tested the electronics , too technical for me , but basically the fan would n't turn on because something electrical was screwed up . I shipped it back to Hasbro ( we 're APO , I ca n't return it to a store ) and after reading all the other reviews I hope they send me a new toy instead of replacing this one.At least Hasbro seems to be good about replacing their items that are defective . I 've had to return items before because they were broken out of the box and it 's always been a hassle free experience .	-1
Purchased from EToys for Christmas 2006 . After less than 6 uses , air compressor stops working . Swapped batteries , tripled checked ( DH is an engineer ) . CAlled Hasbro . They kindly send us a prepaid postage sticker , we send it back.NEw one arrives in late January . Deader than a doornail . Swap for new batteries . Call customer service again . They kindly send us a prepaid postage sticker , we send it back.New one shows up 2 weeks later ( CS provided expedited replacement ) . Unit # 3 had `` dead spots '' where air compressor is not pushing out enough pressure to push puck.By now , DH has had it and refuses to disassemble and send back Unit # 3 ( its a huge effort , they design it so it does not disassemble without a man 's full strength ) so we throw it away.Great toy but do n't buy it - you might get lucky but looking at the reviews , you have a 50 % chance of receiving something that does not work or works for less than 2 weeks , in my experience .	-1
I was so excited to find this toy . I had been searching for it forever . Finally found it in the store and payed way too much on-line for one set of figures . It is made so poor I am so MAD ! ! ! As the other 's said , the funnist part the slide does not stay on at all or the yellow door . How could any company make a toy and clearly did n't test it or even touch it once it was made to see those part 's fall apart , or just did n't care ! Just wanted the money . Their is no way anyone could of autually looked at this product and thought those pieces were going to stay attached . My daughter who is almost 3 was so dissapointed this morning on Christmas morning to have one of her big gift 's be a piece of crap ! The intructions are n't very good for the assembly either . It has a chair and table and scotter which are pointless because the characters do n't bend and ca n't sit . The ear 's ( which I by the way thought the sticker for those went inside ) is a cute little hinding place but most of the characters do n't fit inside , it say 's Pluto 's hiding space but why not make it just a 1/2 inch bigger so all of the characters could fit ? ? ? The song is not like the song on the show and get 's annoying very fast and the characters do n't say very much either and just keep repeating the same thing . I am really upset because I thought this would be a great toy . They should of taken some cues from the little peoples toy 's . They work much better . This is going back to the store.Our daisy is also barking sometimes . I have looked all over on where to complain and ca n't find info anywhere . Only an address on the paper that came with it . Has anyone found anything ? I even tried Better Business Bureau . This is going back to the store for sure but the figures I bought on-line .	-1
My son loves the Mickey Mouse clubhouse show , so he received this for Christmas . He plays with it very seldom and I think it 's just a piece of junk . I 'm sorry to be so harsh , but nothing stays together on this thing . You have to push the character 's down so hard to get them to talk in their own voices that my 2 and a half year old son has a hard time with it . The characters do n't really move much at all and I was just really disappointed with this thing . I would buy something made by one of the more reputable toy companies if I had it to do over again .	-1
My daughter was so excited to open this for her birthday . I was lucky enough to pay the regular store price for the clubhouse , had to pay extra for the figures on ebay . Considering my daughter had been pretending an old carebear house was mickey 's clubhouse , this was a step up in appearance.I do n't see why this toy was so expensive . My daughter who was 3 kept asking why does n't the kutchen pop up and why is n't there a telescope out of the ears ? They cretianly could have made more features . Plus as others have noted the slide and yellow door do n't stay on at all.I had to give this 2 stars because my daughter loves it but it is a frustrating toy for a parent and totally overpriced .	-1
For the 2006 holiday season , this toy is sold out everywhere ! ! My inlaws paid $ 100 for a new one on ebay because my nephew really wanted it for hannukah . In the picture you will see the two parts that stick out from the sides - the blue slide and the yellow thing on the other side . There is a slot to connect them but they neither slide in nor click in . You have to shove them in and they snap back out as soon as you touch them . We solved the slide problem with the crazy glue but the other side did not stay even with crazy glue because the surfaces are not level . Also , the direcs are terrible - does not address the assembly or how to use the figures to make all the talking figures happen . There are decal stickers to affix to different areas and they do n't even give a map of where to put them . You have to look at the pic on the box to figure it out ( and there is one sticker we still have n't figured out yet ) . For the $ 40 retail price , it should be made better and should not need crazy glue , especially since it is designed mainly for preschoolers ( the $ 100 my inlaws paid was a huge waste ) . All in all , once you get it together and figure out how to use the pieces , it 's pretty fun . They are out of this item everywhere , hopefull when they produce more , they will fix the assembly issue !	-1
I would give it 0 stars if my kids did n't love it . I got it for my 2 year old for x-mas and my 4 year old plays with it just as much as he does , which is every day so far . Like most people , I could n't find it anywhere except on EBAY , so I paid more then retail . Normally I do n't mind , but the club house is so poorly made/put together that it is n't worth the retail cost , no less what I paid . It 's bascically a peice of junk in my opinion , and like previous reviewers , I excpected much more from Disney . The characters only say one phrase unless you keep them on `` their own base '' , the club house it 's self does n't do anything that interesting . Over all I 'd say it stinks , but again the kids love it . So at least I 'm getting my money 's worth that way .	-1
My son got this christmas morning and the slide does not stay on , as well as the shoe on the other side ! ! ! Very disappointed . We are trying to talk our son into taking this back and getting some Diego things . It really is a piece of junk ! ! ! ! If only I could talk my son into letting us take this think back . We are going to keep trying ! ! ! ! ! ! !	-1
I am not suprised at all ... Almost every disney toy i have purchased ( and i have many ) does not stay together as it should . For once i would like a disney toy to stay together without crazy clue or some doctoring . The slide and the boot needed to be gorilla glued to stay on . The house does n't do much kind of boring definatly not a favorite . Waist of money .	-1
I ordered this puzzle with two other puzzles during a special on Melissa and Doug puzzles . When I received all three , I wiped them down with a damp cloth before allowing my 20 month old to play with them . Almost immediately the Insects puzzle began to bubble up . It became clear at this point that the pieces an the puzzle are NOT hand painted , but covered in very cheap sticker paper . After allowing the puzzle to dry , I put it down for my child to play with . She picked off pieces of the sticker cover almost immediately . It 's like it disintegrated after contact with water ! Luckily , Amazon has a great return policy for defective goods , so I sent it back thinking it was an anomaly . The second puzzle we received is exactly the same . I have kept it and only let my daughter use it when I 'm around to supervise so she ca n't put any pieces in her mouth or get them wet . How crazy is that ! I think other reviewers are correct in that M & D ; products are no longer held up to high quality standards . They are all made in China and clearly are not tested before being mass produced and put into young children 's hands . I 'm writing M & D ; off of my list of reliable , good toys for my child .	-1
I was so excited to get this puzzle for my little ones . Unfortunately , the item description is misleading . The puzzle looks nice ( before the kids get to it ) and the chunky pieces were a perfect size ! However , this puzzle is NOT hand painted . The puzzle pieces are just faced with a sticker , that easily comes off ( in pieces ! ) . That is not the quality I was expecting , especially from Melissa and Doug . I 've had the puzzle for 2 months now , and 2 or 3 of the pieces have the stickers mostly peeled off . Very disappointed .	-1
I love the concept behind Melissa and Doug toys . Non-toxic paints . Wood products . A little more natural and a little better for the environment . We have the fish bowl that my 16 month old son absolutely loves . The fish bowl has been great and holds up well to his 16 month actions . This puzzle was a real disappointment . The pieces are covered in stickers , not painted and I keep pulling wet sticker paper from his mouth . It 's really colorful and I love the concept behind teaching him about sea creatures but this puzzle is just too poor of quality .	-1
My daughter loves this puzzle when we 're at the library . I wanted to get one for home , but was so disappointed to see that they 're no longer solid paint , but stickers . Children chew on puzzle pieces . It 's going to happen , and when it does , the sticker comes off . Such a shame ...	-1
The premise of the game is great ... spatial reasoning , balance , etc . But the clown does n't balance well on the floor , so you need to play the game on a table , which leads to the inevitable loud banging when all the wood pieces eventually fall down onto the table .	-1
This product does not hold my toddler 's attention in the least . She would rather play with her toy piano , riding car , blocks , stuffed animals , and look at her books than even bat an eye at this thing . The concept of this baby learning station is excellent , however the graphics and content are rather crude and ineffective . Either V.Smile needs to can this product altogether , or they need to improve the graphics and content .	-1
My toddler refuses to play with this toy . I bought this for her when she was nine months old and she showed no interest . The quality of this product was much poorer than I expected . The Leapfrog system looks much cuter . My daughter is now almost two and since we bought it I have tried it about once a month . Even though she loves the toddler computer games , she still shows no interest in this . To be fair , the toy does have alot of educational value if you can get your child to play it . I 'll keep trying , but I 'm beginning to think that this toy just is n't for us .	-1
What a rip-off ! The cords barely connected to either of our TVs and we constantly had to get up and fix them . They were constantly sliding around and making the screen blurry and making buzzing noises . If we could actually get it working that day , the resolution and graphics were HORRIBLE . I seriously thought it was a joke . My son never played with it even though we tried multiple times . Really a waste of money .	-1
My daughter got the vsmile learning system which is great graphics kinda suck but for a first system its ok. My son got this for Chistmas . Graphics are worse then even poor . It 's so bad it drives you crazy . My real issue though was the AV cord . There is something wrong with mine . I 'm not upset that there is something wrong with it cause every company spits out a few buggy systems . I call to have it replaced and thats where I get really pissed . Now I get a lady on the phone . She spoke pretty good English but she was on drugs or something . She would say three words or so of a sentence then just stop talking . She made no sence and randomly stop talking for long periods until i would say `` hello are you there ? '' Then she would say yes and again stop talking . I believe I asked if she was there around 25 times . I got fed up and asked for a supervisor she argued and I ended up asking for a suprevisor around 3 or 4 times . Finally got a supervisor , The supervisor wasnt much better but atleast I knew what was going on with her and she made some sence . Horrible service though . She told me that I would have to send the system to her and eat the cost for shipping . I told her that made no sence when it was their problem not mine and now I have to pay shipping because they screwed up and she said that was their company policy . I told her I will never buy one of their items again and that I will be reporting my service on the internet to help others realize this company is a mistake . I Wish I had gone with the leapfrog/leapstart items but I guess we all make mistakes . I do not plan on paying the shipping for this item I actually plan to return it to the store and have it exchanged for a new one . I would exchange it for one that is not vtech but my son is very attached to the toy part of this system.PLEASE DONT WASTE YOUR TIME ON THIS COMPANY . THIS COMPANY IS THE WORST COMPANY I HAVE EVER DELT WITH ! ! !	-1
My parents bought this desk for my almost 2 year old daughter for Chanukah . We were very excited about this gift and we thought that our daughter would love it . When my dad put it together , I was disappointed that it did not come with a little chair or stool , but I figured I could look past that . However , I quickly learned that this desk has a major flaw . The desk is designed to lift to reveal a piano . When the plastic top is down to cover the piano , it can easily be lifted . It does n't lock into place . My daughter accidentally slammed the plastic desk onto her fingers . We also have a baby and I immediately became afraid that the baby would try to pull up on the desk to reach for the piano and end up getting her little fingers hurt.Believe it or not , this serious design flaw was not the only problem with the desk . Not one hour after it was assembled , it stopped working . We tried using different batteries - even though the batteries we put in the first time were brand new - and it still did n't work.Normally Fisher Price toys are great , but this one should have been better designed .	-1
My 3 yo son got this for Christmas . He 'd been asking for it for a long time , and we were so excited to see him finally get to play with it . The excitement soon wore off , for us and for him . Like others here have said , it falls apart very easily . The zip line does n't stay attached at all , the legs come out with very little effort , the elevator is difficult to work , etc . My son loved the toy but got frustrated a lot when it kept coming apart . Right now all the pieces are in a heap in a corner of his room . He told me the other day to give it to his little brother because he does n't like it anymore . We are going to try to superglue it together and see if that helps . It 's not like he could play with it any less ! I do like how many accessories it comes with . The animals and jeep are fun to play with on their own or with other Diego toys that we have . If you do n't mind putting the set back together several times a day , you and your child might like this toy . Otherwise , look for something sturdier .	-1
This was our second most disappointing toy of the holidays ! Cute animals and sturdy product , but the sounds only work if you open doors , and two of our sounds actually do n't work . Then the product has a random `` slide '' that you can push the chicken on the front of the farm to the left and it pushed down whatever character is there onto the roof slide ? Totally random and really not that much fun . The silo can store the animals but it is very narrow and a bit hard even for my two year old to stick her hand in to get our the animals . There are absolutely no other pieces that come with this farm and really nothing for the animals to do except stand in the barn so it really has n't inspired any creativity or play . Instead the animals have wondered off this farm and have ended up in the Little People house and castle where they have a lot more fun . I would pass on this particular model , not worth the money and not a lot of fun .	-1
I was so excited to receive the new version ( touch & feel farm ) for my son 's 1st birthday . We actually bought the older version , but took it back when we found out ( a week later ) that there was a newer version available . It was a huge disappointment . My son removes the silo faster than I can connect it back on . The animals have `` fur , '' which I thought was a really great idea until my son started biting the hair off of the sheep . The rooster slides across the front of the barn to send the other animals down the slide , and is not removable . By opening three different barn doors you can hear a `` moo '' , `` oink '' , or `` neigh '' and place those animals inside the barn . There is a location for the sheep , and in order to hear the `` baa , '' you push on its hay inside the stall . The only pro I can come up with is that the barn is much lighter in weight than the original . I am sorry I did not keep the original because now I can not find it anywhere .	-1
Ok , first of all the sounds on this brand new toy are n't working . yes I can exchange it but that is not something I have time for and it seems other people had the same issue . But even if the sounds were working , they are in the barn when you open barn doors and not the animals so my 16 month old is not going to hear animal sounds and associate them w/ the animal . The sounds are muffled and not very loud . There are these tiny little STICKERS showing where the animal is supposed to go . My next complaint is that the silo keeps falling off . I am however giving it 2 stars ( instead of 1 ) because my son does like opening and closing the doors and sliding the chicken around .	-1
My 2yo is only mildly interested in this toy . She would rather carry around the animals than mess with the whole thing . The silo pops off daily . I do n't really know why bc it 's really hard for me to pop it back into place . The sounds only sound if you push a button or close a door . So , I do n't really know how it teaches correct sounds for specific animals . My daughter only messes with it for 5 min at a time , then picks it up and throws it into the toybox . I would not buy again .	-1
Fisher-Price toys are junk these days . My son does like it so I am glad I bought it , but this toy is definately not worth the money . The barn doors did n't make noises when they were opened . I did n't want to have the hassle of sending it back and getting a new one so I took the bottom off to see if I could fix it myself . The circuit board in it looked AWFUL . I do n't know how those soldered connections passed quality control ( if there is any quality control ) . I managed to super glue a bit of cardboard so the the switch would work . The only reason I am not fuming is because I got it off Toys r Us when they had buy one get one free on FP toys..and I had a $ 5 gift card.Not impressed at all .	-1
We got this for my son 's 3rd birthday ... ... ... it makes no sense and is so boring , he hates it . The chicken slides back and forth ( non-removeable ) , and all that this does is make sounds when you open barn doors and then you have a bunch of plastic farm animals . Do n't buy it . The toys in the 70 's by fisher price were way cooler .	-1
My 19 month old received this as a Christmas gift this year . From the looks of it I thought it would be a great toy , but it 's pretty lame . First off , that silo thing comes off way too easily and it 's really hard to put back on . It came off literally within minutes of taking it out of the packaging . My daughter will sit and play with the toy , but only for a few minutes because it does n't do anything exciting . There is sliding thing in the front that will push the plastic figure out through the side and it tumbles down the sloping barn . Whoop dee do . There are some sounds , but since ours did n't come with batteries I have n't heard them yet . There are also two little sliding windows on the side ... .not too exciting . Overall for the price of this set , I think it could use a little more pizazz .	-1
Well , we used to love this toy , but after multiple recalls ( both safety from pieces and toxic chemicals ) we decided it just was not worth the risk . Try Playmobil or ELC Happyland Goosefeather Farm instead !	-1
OK , I admit I do n't own this model of the farm and I never will . Not as long as touch and feel animals are with it ! We do own another version of the farm and love the farm itself.What is Fisher Price thinking with the stupid touch and feel little people ! ? ! ? Do n't they know babies and toddlers put these figures in their mouths ! How on earth are you supposed to sanitize/clean one with fur on it ? ! I 've heard of many parents putting the little people figures through the dishwasher to clean them and they hold up great . Well Fisher Price is putting an end to that with all the glorious new textures/materials they are adding to a toy kids suck on.We own just about every little people toy put out in the past 6-7years and I wo n't be buying anymore if they keep changing them to the touch and feel . They are taking the great as it was little people line in a bad new direction.I recommend looking around for an previous version of the farm . Or at last resort , getting this one and chucking the touch and feels and acquiring the regular animals where and when you can .	-1
I bought this for my 19 month old daughter . She loves animals so I thought she 'd really like it . She played with it for about 30 minutes and then completely lost interest . Every now and again she 'll play with it for 5 minutes here or there , but overall it seems pretty boring to her . Yes , the doors make the animal sounds which is fun to hear at first . But , for the price of it , I just do n't think it offers very much .	-1
My son received this toy for his third birthday . I was excited because while he can count , he does n't yet connect quantities with a numeral.However , this toy takes up a lot of space but he does n't ever play with it . Occasionally my one year old will pull out all of the pieces ( playground equipment , easel and ten little people ) and leave them all over the living room . The problem with the toy is that all of the feature are very one dimensional . You can do one thing with each of the four pieces , so there is no room for imagination.But neither child enjoys playing with it , so the chances of it having educational value are low.Big points for not having annoying flashing lights and keeping the annoying noises to a minimum , though !	-1
For some reason I thought that the train was motorized and would travel around the track but unfortunately , that is not the case . The child needs to push it by hand . While doing this , music will start to play and then some of the ABC buttons on the track will go off arbitrarily . It 's rather confusing and not very rewarding . The track is not well designed as the child needs to lean over or sit on the track to reach the buttons . I bought this hoping to reinforce alphabet learning but this toy does not deliver . The only way to hear the letters is to press the buttons on the track but the stickers are not very interesting and so get ignored . It seems the most functional part of the toy is identifying the animals yet the animals are rather abstract looking . This toy is very disappointing and not very educational .	-1
I let my toddlers play with it in their high chairs . Neither of my twins enjoyed it much . And now both trays have sticky residue . Play-Doh is much better .	-1
Honestly , I HATE this product . It does not mold well , does not hold together and after opening two colors , they were all over my house , - the little foamy balls just fell apart and my toddler managed to spread them everywhere . Of course he did show some interest to the foamy substances as to anything new , but he could not do anything with the foam , and neither could I . Then , you need to compress them into some shape to store because obviously , they do n't fit the original box they came in . I am sending mine to a trash bin !	-1
