What a fun story . I love the tension between the hero and the heroine . I ca n't wait until she find out he was the one she kissed playing 'Truth or Dare ' .	1
I really liked Blake and Jennifer they were very down to earth and I loved the push and pull between them . I 'm just starting that man 3 so hoping they work out . Great writing style and kept me interested	1
Complimentary copy provided by author in exchange for an honest review.This is my first time reading Ms. L'Amour 's work and I 'm so glad I got a chance to read this . It 's not an easy thing to write dual POV and be able to accurately capture the voice of the opposite sex and make it sound realistic , but Ms. L'Amour definitely has that style hands down when it comes to Blake 's telling of the story . I 've had several laugh out loud moments throughout this book , but nothing was more funny than the Shabbat dinner debacle.There is more to Blake than what you expect , and Jennifer is one lucky woman . I love the operation name Blake has come up with in order to get rid of the competition , and the first attack volley he launched ! The serious drama does n't occur until the last 4 pages of the book and that ends on a cliffhanger , so be sure you have the next part ready to go so you can know what happens.I would definitely recommend this series !	1
What Blake can do to me . The chemistry that Blake and Jennifer share makes your heart beat fast but your panties get wetter . It only gets better .	1
Loved this book ! Clever writing , keeps you hooked in the story . Character development great . Hot and sexy too ! Highly recommend .	1
Read in just a few hours ! Could n't put it down . I love a good girl catches the bad boy story .	1
This may be my new favorite series ! Blake Burns is my current new book boyfriend . Nelle hooked me in from page one . I love the witty humor . I just loved it all . I love Blake . He is the perfect cocky lead male . Jennifer is the girl who just got the kiss of her life and she was blindfolded . I love that ! I want to fan girl gush here , but I do n't want to give to much away . This is a must read ! One that all should read . Jennifer is the girl we all can relate to and Blake is the man we all love to want ! But oh the cliff hanger .	1
This book sucked me in from page one . The warning at the beginning only severs to entice the reader in my opinion , but then maybe I 'm just insane.I loved every moment of this story despite ... or maybe because of the dark themes . I do n't want to give anything away because this is defiantly worth the read . I highly , highly recommend it to fans of the genre , and even newbies looking to step into the world of dark fantasy .	1
This book is much shorter than the first series , but believe it or not , it 's even better ! I could n't put it down , it 's nonstop action . Without giving away too much , I think many Venir fans will be pleased with the outcome . The Trinos and Scorch storyline takes an unexpected yet wonderful twist . It 's nice to see the author spend a little more time on some of the more intriguing characters in the first series . Well done Halloran !	1
Another great book buy Craig Halloran ! I was a little skeptical at first after the way the last book went but I can say that I 'm happy the way things seem to be headed the true Darkslayer has returned !	1
The Wilde brothers fall fast - and hard - but unlike Riley and Cooper in their book , The Wilde Riders , see my review of it here , Gracie and Tucker have a slow build towards intimacy . They have reasons to go slow , they 've both been hurt , both bear scars , neither think they are worthy , but they are both desperately in need of someone to love them.Tucker and Gracie 's romance is lovely , the way they care for each other , accept each other and the grand gesture ... I was rooting for them every step of the way . Tucker is our wounded warrior . He can be scary and intimidating but he 's also gentle , protective and respectful and treats Gracie like she 's special , someone to be cherished . Gracie is tiny but her strength is immense . Her life has been everything from bad to horrific but she does n't give in . With a little kindness , a bit of help and someone who cares about her she begins to gain confidence and start to take some control over her life.The other brothers ? We get to see Riley and Cooper and get a little more insight into the dysfunctional relationship between Harley and Jake ( I ca n't wait for their book ! ) . Up next is Hunter and I 'm eagerly awaiting his story.Disclosure : ebook provided in exchange for an honest review	1
This is book two in the Old Town Country Romance series.Each book can be read as a standalone.I gave this book 5 stars.I do suggest you read them all as you wo n't want to miss out on any of these hot men ! ! This is Tuckers story.He 's back from Iraq and he 's injured physically and mentally.He has his eyes on Grace and feels a pull towards her . Can these two damaged souls find peace in each other ? I really enjoyed reading this story about Tucker . Gracie finds something in this man that she has been always searching for . Even though they are drawn to each other they still have so many obstacles to over come . Like her ex . This is from both POV so you get to see what each of them are feeling . Tucker saved her , but she saved him too . It is a very emotional and beautiful story.Thank you Savannah for your wonderful story ! I can not wait to read the next book in this series .	1
I must admit , I 'd been waiting for Tucker 's story since learning about him and the other Wilde brothers in Cooper and RIley 's story Wilde Riders . I 'm glad I did n't have to wait too long . Tucker , an Operation Iraqi Freedom veteran , falls head-over-heels for Gracie , who 's caught in an abusive relationship . Young takes us through the healing of two broken people as only an apt writer can , with memorable characters , sweet dialogue , tense situations , and episodes of steamy sex thrown in to boot.I wish one of Gracie 's relationships had had more time to develop ( do n't want to give away her relationship with whom -- it is a familial one ) , but that did n't deter me from the rest of the novel.Bring on Hunter 's story !	1
I was given this book in exchange for an honest review.This was a short , but captivating read . I found myself unable to put it down until the end . This is part of a series ( which I will be buying the others in the series ) but it can be read as a stand alone . The characters are relatable and the storyline flows well . Ca n't wait to read the rest of the series !	1
First , realize the cover photo of the guy does not match Tucker & # 8217 ; s description . I mean he is supposed to be a bad-ass , ex-military with 15+ tattoos and a single look makes most men flee in fear . Granted , I can get past it , but it took a bit to change the image with what I was reading ( took me out of the story for a bit to change the sweet cowboy imagine ) The story starts with Gracie at an especially low point of a negative self-worth , even for most story plots , which made it difficult to read . Glad to see the character growth took a gradual recovery , because otherwise it would have felt fake . However , it started soooo low that Gracie still wasn & # 8217 ; t too healthy even at the end.Also , glad the plot didn & # 8217 ; t have Tucker making too many mistakes with Gracie because again any regress on Gracie & # 8217 ; s part would have made for slow book.I dropped a star , because the ending was too rushed and Dex ( the bad guy ) reactions and motivations really seemed out in left field & # 8211 ; almost idiotic . Also the brothers & # 8217 ; hostile reactions towards Gracie didn & # 8217 ; t make much sense and it never really was explained well.That said , I would read others in the series and recommend this read ( provided recovering from an abusive relationship isn & # 8217 ; t an emotional trigger for you & # 8211 ; it does have some intense situations ) . As a matter of full disclosure , I received my Kindle version for free from StoryCartel [ dot ] com in exchange for a balanced and honest review .	1
This is a love story about two broken people . Tucker survived a horrible bombing while serving in Iraq & # 8212 ; many of his friends were killed while he came home with a badly mangled leg . Gracie grew up with an addict mother who traded her to a biker in exchange for drugs.But when Gracie enters the bar owned by Tucker and his brothers , he & # 8217 ; s immediately drawn to her . He rescues her from the mean biker dude and invites her to his home , so he can watch out for her . She agrees , as she has no one else to turn to . But what begins as necessity soon turns to love.Besides their traumatic pasts , Tucker and Gracie have something else in common : they both see themselves as damaged and believe no one could love them . The thing is , in Tucker & # 8217 ; s eyes , Gracie is perfect . And she feels exactly the same way about him.I really enjoyed this story . Both characters have been terribly hurt , but they are brave and loving . Tucker & # 8217 ; s tough exterior hides a gentle heart . Gracie & # 8217 ; s shy self-consciousness doesn & # 8217 ; t take away from her determination to put Tucker first . Their lovemaking is touching . It & # 8217 ; s much more than just sex for them.The story is told in first person , Tucker & # 8217 ; s point of view alternating with Gracie & # 8217 ; s. The only problem with this was I felt that Tucker , a former soldier who & # 8217 ; s been though a lot , would have a & # 8220 ; rougher & # 8221 ; sounding voice.Everything not perfect with Tucker and Gracie . Tucker & # 8217 ; s overprotective brothers mistrust her . The couple is also threatened by the biker & # 8217 ; s insistence that Gracie belongs to him . Tucker makes an amazing sacrifice that I didn & # 8217 ; t see coming , but made him all the more lovable.This book is second in a series about the four brothers , and I & # 8217 ; m looking forward to reading more about them . I highly recommend The Wilde One if you & # 8217 ; re looking for a story that & # 8217 ; s both sexy and heartwarming.I received this book in exchange for an honest review , without further remuneration . This review originally appeared at The Divas of Desire blog .	1
I just finished The Wilde One and I liked it . This is apart of a series so you do have to read the first one if you want a back story but it could be read as a stand alone . First one is the Wilde Riders so keep that in mind . This is one about Tucker Wilde , one of the Wilde brothers . He was in the army and had gotten hurt so he is dealing with alot of physical and mental problems . He is basically broken and going through alot . Gracie stumbles in with Dex at Tuckers family bar . He can tell she is not happy and is scared . Dex is not a very nice man and you can tell that by his demeanor . Tucker not meaning to cause problems tries to talk to Gracie but there are some ramifications . Dex beats her and leaves her in the dirt and that is where Tucker finds her . He wants to save her . They both have insecurities and they are both scared so will they be able to let their guard down ? You will have to read and see ... I liked the story . It was very quick yet cute . It was really easy to follow and it was an enjoyable read . Tucker is a wounded man and to me those are the best ones to fall for . Gracie , I felt bad for her . No one should ever be hurt like that . I like that they were set together to heal each other . They were broken and healed each other.I liked the secondary characters and can not wait to see what happens in the series . I believe this is something that you will enjoy ! ! Story 4Sex 3Overall 4Reviewed by Beggin from Mommys a Book Whore	1
This is book 2 in the Old Town Country Romance but each can be read as a stand alone because this one involves around Tucker Wilde . This is an emotional novel , so get ready for some possible tears . I have to say my heart hurt for him especially with the way he was treated and felt like you could feel it through the book ( even though this is stand alone you some of how he is in the first book ) . He is an Army Veteran and much like many others came back with a physical injury which caused a spiral negativity on how he is looked at . In my opinion I loved this character the most because you see how he grows and learns to overcome the obstacle . When Gracie comes into the story you learn that not only has she been through a lot but there are also emotional bindings to her too . Each of these two have emotion problems , will they both learn to overcome them together and possible have a future together . This story is one that has everyday life problems we face and makes you understand that under that line there is still something sweet and love can still bloom from & # 8220 ; damaged & # 8221 ; people . This author knows how to pull you into her novels because her writing will fall in love with each of the characters that much more . I will definitely be following her and trying to see what else she will be coming up with on Hunter and Jake .	1
This is a very good book . It is the second in the Wilde brother series . This is Tucker 's story . Savannah Young does a good job making you understand how an injured Iraq Veteran like Tucker feels . It is heartwarming to see the relationship that builds between Tucker and Grace . I look forward to the other books in this series . *** I received this book as a gift in exchange for my honest review . ***Reviewed by Laura	1
Happy and Skip are two lovely little dogs . My children aged 6 and 8 , enjoyed the story . It is written well and the pictures are warm and expressive . If this is the first in the series , we certainly look forward to more .	1
As my daughter is now 7 years old and she liked this book very much , I can say that it is a great storybook for young children . I am glad to see an author making dogs look as friendly and cooperative as I know they can be . The story will also be an easy read for older children who are still just learning to read .	1
Loved it from beginning to end , Kardale needs some counseling too , ca n't wait to see what happens in part 2	1
this author writes the best stories this book is so good I ca n't wait for pt.2 excellent job on this book	1
this story as good from the begining to end i only got two words COP THIS you 'll love it thumb up to this author	1
Well written , Mr. Jason Hooper.. The characters are awesome..Kardale & Grace were two of a kind . Kardale ' s friendship with Randy was just too tense . Strange friendship .	1
Ok the stuff that goes on in this book are some of the things that go on in everyday . People can be so trifling it ai n't funny . Too many secrets to count . No honesty anywhere . The author did an awesome job of telling this story .	1
Wow Grace is a nut case . Matter of fact I think all of them are crazy . Ca n't wait for all secrets to be revealed .	1
The blurb interested me from the start and pulled me in which is great because that 's what a blurb is supposed to do . But a lot of people can write a decent blurb . Having a story there to back it up is what makes this book worth a read . I like novellas because , when they are well done , they are the perfect length between a quick short story and a novel that I find myself involved with for days . Sometimes that 's not a bad thing . But often I find myself going to a novella because if I want a quiet afternoon of reading they are usually the perfect choice.This one did n't disappoint in that regard either . April is an easy character to sympathize with and understand . She , like all of the main characters in this series , have a history that makes sense and fuels their actions . Ever get that kind of feeling where a character does something out of no where and you 're sort of left wondering what the hell was that ? Yeah , I think a lot of us have been there . And thankfully this author never puts us through that sort of ordeal . April makes sense in the way a person should which is refreshing and what 's also really nice is that none of this story was predictable . It checked off all of my boxes of things I love about a romance novella and I was glad to have picked it up .	1
I really enjoyed April and the Single Heart . If you 're into fun , easy-to-read romance novels that are n't too ridiculously over-the-top , you 'll really dig this . The dialogue between the characters is natural and humorous . I always like to say , the test of a good romance novel is - would I like to read these people 's conversations if there was n't some sex in this book ? And I definitely would . There 's a tinge of Sex and the City-style interaction that adds a great , entertaining level to this book . Plus , the steamy scenes are nice and HOT ! Five stars !	1
A Novella of fascinating proportions that sure to become instant classic ! Main Characters April McKenzie and Gail embark on a journey that is far from home on an epic journey to find a their place in the world . Both of the characters have different personalities : April is loose and vivacious while Gail is more a more centered lifestyle . Both are best friends venturing out of Seattle for the first time . April , because of her free spirited personality goes through multiple men with the hopes of finding love.In short this is a novella that touches the heart of self-discovery . It & # 8217 ; s adventurous , emotional and even thrilling at times . The storyline and plot theme develops lovely . I also found it to be extremely well written in a descriptive fashion that will immerse inside the story . The characters have depth and feeling providing them with multi-dimensional personalities that are easy to understand and relate to.Total read time for me was just a few hours . The ending left me wanting more from the series that I cant wait to get me hands on.5 stars !	1
I thought this was quite an entertaining sci-fi read . It had everything I hoped for , action , adventure , twists and turns . Something unexpected happened everytime I turned around . Enjoyed it !	1
Sometimes we seem to be living in a virtual world of our own destiny . But we do have a say about what we do because we have `` free will '' given to us by God . This story gave me pause to think what it would be like if we did n't have that blessing of `` free will '' to make our own destiny ... to live our lives as we want ... to pursue happiness .	1
How I Lost 80 LBS in 5 Months By Just Drinking More WaterThe title of this book immediately had my attention . This was such an enlightening book about something very simple . Tiffany Young shares her story of being obese , having diabetes , and being depressed . Her weight had a devastating effect on her body and at this point , she knew she had to do something . After her Mother discovers the H2O diet , Tiffany does a little research and decides to give it a try . She takes us along with her on the five month journey , month by month . Tiffany shares with us how she incorporates water into her daily activities and the results she achieves each month . I recommend this book to anyone who has tried every diet out there , with no results . Who would have thought that just drinking more water could make such an extreme , positive , difference ?	1
I picked this book up on the & # 8220 ; free books list & # 8221 ; today , and read it while doing my exercise . It is a short book , but a book with a lot of impact . It is well written , and well structured , but most important is the information she supplies about how she lost all that weight by drinking more water . ( By the way , this book is well worth paying for ! ) She doesn & # 8217 ; t say what she ate while losing all that weight , but I gather she ate pretty much the Standard American Diet , but & # 8220 ; watered down & # 8221 ; ( literally ) with all that water . She plainly wouldn & # 8217 ; t be able to eat as much , but I do know from years past that drinking a lot of water in order to eat less ( of the Standard American Diet ) left me feeling a lot of hunger . For me , any & # 8216 ; diet & # 8217 ; I have ever used - whether it is vegan or Paleo - requires I eat plenty of vegetables in order to restrain my hunger - even with water . But , then I never have drank the level of water she is speaking of , at least not around mealtimes or with meals.I grew up with the belief that a person should n't drink fluids during a meal because it diluted the digestive juices . But , one of Dr. Oz shows encouraged drinking fluids with meals because otherwise the stomach has a hard time getting the nutrients out of such a thick mass of food . So , Dr. Oz is confirming just what this author spoke of.From now on I will be drinking a lot more water with and around meal-times . Up to this time I have been trying to limit my water consumption during meals to & # 8217 ; no more than 8 ounces & # 8217 ; .I have noticed before that at times when I am into drinking a lot of water , that the weight seems to fall off even if I 'm not really behaving myself perfectly with food . And , even when I am eating well , that oftentimes the weight does n't come off so well when I & # 8216 ; m not drinking much water . I was aware of this , but it never really sunk in until I read this book . From here on out I will be making sure to drink my water ! I am going to type out the water schedule and amounts she used , and use it as a guideline to get me drinking more water all through the day . Hopefully it will work the magic of removing my excess weight as it did for her .	1
I was gifted a copy of this book for an honest review*This book broke my heart.It has some very difficult topics and is not for the faint of heart.Liam broke my heart andI wanted to reach though and steal him out of the situations that he has to go through.Justin is Liam 's friend that lives across the hall . It is safe to say that Justin has had a crushon Liam for quite some time , but because he was with Cord , Justin has never acted on it . This book a mustread . I do n't do spoilers . So please read .	1
I was really into this story and finished it in one sitting . I loved Liam and Justin and really wanted them to find the whole hearts and flowers , sunshine and roses kind of happy ending . I guess that would n't have fit considering the circumstances of Liam 's life though . While I did enjoy the story and seeing how it all took place there was just way too much of the other characters and not enough of Justin and Liam . I wanted to get to them , I wanted them to make it work . Yes eventually we kinda got there but not quite where I had hoped they would be.Liam has had an aweful life . He was on the streets at barely sixteen and used by the man that took him off the streets as nothing more than a sex slave . Cord fed Liam lies that nothing is free including a bed to lie his head on at night . Liam felt he owed Cord and has basically lived a life of sexual servitude for over two years . Justin is Liam 's friend that lives across the hall . It is safe to say that Justin has had a crush on Liam for quite some time , but because he was with Cord , Justin has never acted on it.We get to see different sides of the characters and for a bit I was unsure exactly which way this book was headed . For awhile I thought Justin was just going to help Liam and I did n't think they were going to get a happy ending , at least not together . In the end we finally get to see Justin and Liam making progress as a couple and in their way they are happy .	1
she never fails . the books are well written the stories keep you oing wanting more needing more ... LOL ... dam.. beck is so hot . and i really love how the other characters are still involved ... loved this one .	1
A wonderful addition to this series . I enjoyed Beck and Emilie 's story . I am looking forward to the next book . With more of Austin and Amy story .	1
This is one series that can only get better . It is truly a path to realize Tue love in this world 's reality . We need more .	1
This definitely was n't my favorite of the series , but I did like it for the most part . The characters were enjoyable , the sex was insanely hot , and the pace was n't too slow ... however , I feel like the story kind of lacked depth and there was n't enough history given about the characters . While likeable , it was hard to get a sense of who they are and where they come from . The ending was cute and slightly funny , but entirely too easy ... all of that aside , I do recommend the book . It was enjoyable , just lacking a little ... Oooh and I definitely want to read about Tax and Melissa ! ! I think that 'd be a potentially awesome story .	1
Yep the Triple M fever really is contagious ! This time Beck gets bit by the love bug ... ..This is Romeo and Juliet m.c . style with a much happier ending ! Start at the beginning and read this series in order and fall in love right along with the members of the Triple M Motorcycle Club .	1
LOVE this series . They keep getting better and better . Looking forward to the next one which is coming out in May .	1
I have loved Beck since he first walked onto the page in Losing Me , Finding You and I have been waiting with bated breath for his story . I always knew there was a lot more to him than was immediately obvious and boy , was I right ! He is one heck of a guy with some deep-seated issues , but he 's also charming and funny as hell . But above all else , he 's loyal and he believes in and will fight to the death to protect those he loves - and he loves deeply . Once you become a part of Beck 's heart , you 're there for life and he will do anything for you - and I mean ANYTHING . This guy would move mountains for those he loves if he has to and he almost does in this book . This one is by far my favorite of the series .	1
Motorcycle , blood baths , living for the moment . Great series as always ca n't wait for the next book . Kept putting off finishing it because I did n't want it to end though I was dying to find out what next ...	1
Where to start ? I was soo excited for Beck 's story . It has felt like a long time coming ! I was a tiny bit disappointed with the story . I just felt it lacked what the other books have had . Not a whole bunch goes on and I LOVE Beck , he is hilarious , but sometimes he got on my nerves and he is majorly weird , in a good way of course , just sometimes I felt it was a bit much , but again , I get that is his character , and I just felt his and Tease 's relationship was weird , happens too fast and it was just awkward . I for sure think they were meant to be and I felt a connection , I just think it happens way too fast and is a little messed up and would of liked to see some more relationship building there . And I wanted more period ! ! ! ! ! ! ! I want to see if she gets pregnant and I just want more . I always want more with CM 's books . But I imagine they will be in the next book , so it 's all good . Very excited for that . I loved seeing more Austin and Gaine and the whole crew . I missed this guys . All in all it was a good read and very hot and I love this series . I was just a tiny bit let down and expected a whole lot more that what we were given . But still a great read : - ) can not wait for more Austin and Amy and to see where their new lives go and what all happens : - ) I would like to read about Tax and Melissa also ! how in the f*** does that happen ! ? I would LOVE to read about the time they had her a hostage. & # 34 ; You 've got ta approach with cheese before you can pet . Catch my drift ? & # 34 ; & # 34 ; Sometimes you do n't get to choose your partner . Live chooses it for you. & # 34 ; & # 34 ; Boy meets girl and magic happens , lady love . Get over yourself .

I pretty much love everything C.M . puts out . This series has been no exception for me . I loved reading about Austin and Amy , Gaine and Mireya , and now Beck and Tease ! Great book , great read !	1
Remember when you were a kid and you rode your bike down hill , full speed , and let go of the handlebars ? That 's what it 's like to read CM Stunich . A wild ride that you have to just let go of control and enjoy every moment of it . Love this series , a must read for biker junkies .	1
Oh man . I ca n't even count the ways I loved this book . May be my favorite one so far . Come on may . Momma needs book 4 .	1
This is a great book for introverts like me . Like it says in the book us introverts get a bad rap , that we are anti-social and such.GREAT BOOK I recommend ! !	1
A very interesting read as I have been an introvert for all my life but never even considered it being an advantage so this was an eye opener , I now feel more comfortable in my own skin , must buy .	1
& # 34 ; Gold is a metal that is yellow , shiny and always in demand . It has real monetary worth due to the & # 34 ; value & # 34 ; that people place on ownership of it . Do you think your goals and beliefs should have an intrinsic & # 34 ; value & # 34 ; ? A great quote from the book and for sure the book has great value too . You will really get to know the true meaning of life and its value when you read this book . easy to read and understand . The book has significant information as far as our daily lives are concerned.I would recommend it to all .	1
I read book and brushed up on some techniques I was somewhat familiar with and learned some new ones as well . I had a few takeaways from the book .	1
Very , very cool : ) I am a Marie F Crow fan & # 8230 ; I support her works in every way & # 8230 ; from her Risen series to Abigail here ! I absolutely love this dynamic duo , lol ! Every page I am looking for her pet zombie and his unique lingo , RAAA RAA RAAAA ? There is something about that guy that makes me laugh every time.With humor and INCREDIBLE artwork & # 8230 ; the book teaches very important lessons to the kids that otherwise might not have a way to understand them so well.Its another smashing hit from the mind of author Marie F Crow & # 8230 ; cK	1
This is the third book in the Abiligal series . My kids and I read the first one , and skipped to number three because it was spring themed . As far as I can tell the order you read them in does n't matter much , they are kids early readers so there are no long story arcs or anything.As with the other Abigal and her pet Zombie books , my 4 year old daughter , and 8 year old son just get a kick out of it . She just loves when she sees the dog run away with the zombie 's leg.The illustrations are wonderfully done and really engage the kids . They are cute and drawn in a very tasteful manner so nothing is gross or gory . There is between 1 and three short sentences per page , so it 's very easy for your early readers to follow along . My kids were raised in the south and do n't really have any experience with snow , so it was exciting for them to see Abigail waiting for spring to come after all the snow.I 'm always glad to find books that my two younger kids love and want to keep reading . The bad part for me ( just like the other Abigail book ) is they want me to read it over and over and over , and over ... and over.The message for the kids in this book is keep trying and do n't ever give up . And sometimes you have to rely on friends for help , even if it 's a little scary .I love when the kids learn life lessons and do n't even realize it .	1
I received a free copy of this book to read and review for Wicked Reads Review Team.This book was really hard for me to get into at first . The beginning seemed like a monotone monologue and I wasn & # 8217 ; t sure if I was going to make it through the book . SO glad I stuck it out . The book seemed to change directions and once it did it held my attention and I was left waiting more at the end of the book . Tasha marries her best friend Felix . Felix is every woman & # 8217 ; s dream man & # 8230 ; .until he changes . Luca and Kammie are Tasha and Felix & # 8217 ; s best friends and you can feel the great friendship they have in this book . Once Felix starts to change Luca and Kammie become even more a part of their lives and so does Caleb . Who is Caleb ? Just some random stranger that believes in fate and becomes more than a stranger.Characters : I felt I was right there in Tasha & # 8217 ; s shoes and Caleb touched my heart . Kammie and Luca are great supporting characters and then Felix well ; Felix just goes to show you that things aren & # 8217 ; t always what they seem.Sex : the scenes are intenseReligious : noWould I recommend to others : yesMore than one book in the series : yesGenre : not sure what I would classify this asWould I read more by this author : yes	1
I love this story ! When I started reading this book I had know idea how it would go . It starts at Natasha and Felix 's wedding and at first I though he was great , perfect really , but it really did n't take to long before I started to hate him . My Heart broke for Natasha , she 's a newlywed and this was supposed to be such a happy time in her life and she was stuck in a nightmare . I was an emotional mess . I felt her pain . I love Caleb , I 'm Team Caleb . He 's perfect , smart and smoking hot and my new BBF . I love the chemistry between Caleb and Tasha and their instant connection . The night that Tasha meets Caleb she finds a dear friend in him and also finds out the monster Felix can be . I hope to also see more of Luca and Kammie I think there 's a great story to be told there . Krissy V is amazing she makes you feel every emotion . I ca n't wait to see what happens next .	1
Tasha got married to Felix . Felix became very possessive after they got married . Tasha was out and spilled her drink on a guy . Felix got extremely jealous .	1
Definitely not the book I was expecting . I tend to stick to romance book with happily ever after and some drama just not to the extent of this book . it was a very gripping story that kind of reminded me of the movie enough . The ending hit me like a brick wall . Felix was the prince charming that Tasha has always wanted until they say their I do & # 8217 ; s than everything changes and not for the better but for the worst . Even though this book is not in the list of books I usually read I am curious to find out what will happen in book two	1
Natasha meets Felix . Natasha loves Felix . Natasha marries Felix . Natasha begins to realize she did n't really know Felix . After they marry , Natasha slowly begins to discover she never truly knew the man she loved . As the truth comes to the surface Natasha ` Tasha ' is adamant that she will do what she can to make her marriage work . She married Felix and she wants to stick with him , even though their relationship goes above and beyond being a `` rocky marriage . '' With an ever present fear of her own husband and the budding friendship between her and mystery man Caleb , Tasha finds herself wondering what happened to the man she loved and how could this happen to her.I started this book , and felt myself not liking it , at all . I felt the writing was choppy ; there was no depth or detail to any of it . Everything is from Natasha 's POV and I felt I was just reading a timeline starting from when she and Felix got married . Initially , there was just too much of Natasha 's thoughts and descriptions of moments from the past and not enough dialogue between the characters . I felt myself unable to connect with Tasha , which to me is really important seeing as she is the heroine and the reader is ultimately in her head . I wanted to stop reading quite a few times and just did n't know if I could finish it.However , I did n't stop reading . I forged on like the addicted reader that I am , because frankly I needed to see what happened next . I am extremely happy that I did , and this my friends is why I finish what I start . A book that started out seemingly crappy , turned out really good.This book is not a romance . The main theme is domestic violence and abuse . There are extremely graphic , disturbing and heartbreaking scenes that build the anticipation and angst of what Tasha 's next move will be . With the introduction of Caleb into the story there is a very small element of romance or flirtation . When it came to Caleb and Tasha I found myself moving around a lot , I could n't sit still . I eventually did connect with Tasha and I was in her corner , waving my pom poms yelling `` come on girl you got this . '' Yet , the reader does n't find out in this installment what happens . Nope , because of course , a book that I did n't think I was going to like has a killer cliffhanger and now I have to wait for the next one . I REALLY want the next one.When you read this book , be patient because it does start out slow and dull , but damn it turns around and will completely toss you around like a rag doll , piss you off , break your heart and sometimes make you smile ! The anticipation for the sequel is killing me and I ca n't wait to see what happens next with this story ! *I received a copy of this book in exchange for an honest review*	1
I just finished reading For Better Or For Worse . It is written by Krissy V. It 's about a woman who marries the man of her dreams . After getting married , he turns out to be a different man then she thought he was . She becomes scared and confused . She does n't know who to turn to and she feels alone.Before I talk about how I felt about this book , I want to give Krissy V. a salute for being able to write this book . It must have taken her a lot of courage . I respect and admire that about her . I really enjoyed this book . It through me through some loops , but it kept me on edge through the whole thing . It was dramatic and suspenseful , and it was also sweet and seductive in some points.The only thing I really did n't like about this book was that I felt that the main character was portrayed as a little childish . I get that a lot of abused women start to take on this quality , so I 'm not saying this as a bad thing or an insult against the author . I just feel it kind of contradicts here trying to get the jobs she 's going for interviews for.I fully recommend many women read this story . I especially recommend it to women who are or have been abused in their life , or those who know somebody who is or might be abused . This was a powerfully intense story . It 's well worth the read !	1
This book is so short and interesting , not boring at all ! There are so many things about World War II that could have been hidden from us and it 's so great to learn about . The book tells how the war got started and some conspiracy theories about it . Some of the theories involve religion and have n't been proven nor disproven . It gives a lot of facts so you can make your own decisions without bias . There 's even a theory that says the Pearl Harbor bombing was known about beforehand and could have been stopped . It 's such a great piece of history and great things came from it like Anne Frank 's Diary . It was a terrible war , but being able to learn about all of the secrets that may have been kept from us is so interesting . We always need to learn from our mistakes to prevent other wars !	1
Definitely an interesting read . I just love world war II , and am fascinated by it , that is why I bought this book . The secret weapons , conspiracies and experiments were extremely intriguing ! Gave me a lot of food for thought . Would highly recommend this book for others to read , especially those who love world war II as much as I do !	1
The history and facts surrounding World War II hold the attention of the majority of mankind regardless of age or even interest in history . There is such a deep horror of all the tragedy involved that I think we are especially interested in details because we want to make sure it never happens again & # 8211 ; especially the Holocaust . But I & # 8217 ; ve not really looked into the many conspiracy theories around about WWII , but the title of this book drew my attention . I love how it presents the reasons why the various theories exist and the details that might make them credible & # 8211 ; or not . This author offers a short and understandable explanation of many theories but leaves it up to the reader to decide whether each theory is plausible or not . It was also really intriguing to learn about some of the & # 8220 ; secret weapons & # 8221 ; used . I had no idea that dogs were used as & # 8220 ; suicide bombers & # 8221 ; & # 8211 ; horrific ! I enjoyed expanding my knowledge about World War II and the conspiracy theories that surround it and pray to God that we never have such an awful event on a global scale ever again !	1
While laughing uncontrollably in Part One , you get to know the characters better and root for Shannon and Dec in spite of and despite the varying opinions of the other females in her laugh giving their point of view ... and of course the semi-stalking ex who clearly has a jealous streak.A fun , enjoyable , laugh out loud , relatable , and wonderful novel ... .Part three ca n't come soon enough . : )	1
When you start reading this , be in a place where you can finish it . This series is hilarious . Shannon is a girl that we should all have as a friend . The outside characters including her mother , sister and friends just make the story even better . I laughed out loud throughout the entire shortt book . You will not regret . It . Funny , engaging and quirky .	1
Loved the aggressively honest and literally laugh-out-loud humor in this book . Probably seemed insane reading it , I laughed so much . Real-sized Shannon hooks up with exceedingly rich Declan . Or tries to . Her family and the outrageously comedic situations that come up as she tries to date Declan are really a joy to read . My only reservation is that the romance takes a back seat to her family and the hilarity ... I wanted more of Declan and Shannon . Nice conflict with her jerk of an ex Steve pursuing her via text message and other means . Really fun , and enough story that you 're rooting for them and want more .	1
This is a fantastic series ! Hot , sexy , and funny as all get out . More power to you Julia Kent . You are rocking it ! !	1
I read one and two back to back . I will devour book three as soon as it is out . These books are laugh out loud funny , sweet , romantic and just plan amazing . Everything Julia 's writes is ...	1
I am enjoying this book . I find myself laughing and moaning while reading this book . I am anticipating what happens next . The characters are very realistic . The plot is believable . I definitely will be looking for the next segment .	1
I was gifted a complimentary copy of this book in exchange for an honest review.This is the 2nd part to the Shopping for a Billionaire Series . The first installment was released in the A Sweet Life Boxed Set.Just like the first part installment of this series , part 2 had me laughing throughout its entirety . Julia Kent has a way of taking every day things and circumstances that could happen to anyone and put them together to make an entertaining story that not only engages the reader but connects you to the characters as well.In this one we have Shannon dealing with her seemingly out of control attraction to Declan . Throw in an ex-boyfriend that does n't understand what the word no means , a well intentioned over-bearing mother who dreams of a Farmington wedding , and a cat with PTSD and you can see how any situation would get out of hand.I really admired Declan for his calm and steadfast attitude . No matter what mess was thrown at him he seems to be a rock . I 'm really looking forward to seeing how this romance goes from here and what Shannon 's family and friends will do next !	1
Dive back into Ms. Kent 's new characters . True to her style this series has plenty of witty banter and internal dialogue that will have you laughing out loud . The 'Kentisms ' are on point and timely . If reading in public be ready to explain why you are laughing so hard tears are rolling down your cheeks . Warning there is a feline character that has a huge attitude and at times seems human ! His present to his mistress is timely and is a gift that kept giving ! Shannon is an ordinary girl with some of the strangest luck , especially where men are concerned . As a mystery shopper her job sounds like fun and has some funny perks.Declan is one of those men who seem to look beyond the exterior , since he and Shannon met in a men 's restroom . He is an intriguing character that you will look forward to getting to know over the course of this series.On top of everything crazy going on with Shannon 's work , Declan and her persistent ex ... she has a hilarious family . From her pushy mother wanting a country club wedding to her trying to please everyone father , zingers abound . Her sister almost seems normal , then she gets sucked into their mothers discussions ( yep the sisters have to endure hearing about their parents sex life ) .I ca n't wait to see what happens next !	1
I loved how the author of this book describe the advantages of being a supreme introvert . The skills stated in this book will surely be a good weapon to beat competition and become more successful in life . Recommended .	1
I am an introvert by choice and there is nothing shy or timid about me . The author explains what a true introvert is and shows how to use the characteristics of an introvert to get ahead . I believe this book will be especially good for the truly shy and timid introverts . A good read with many tips !	1
All of my life I have been an introvert . I had always thought of it as a disadvantage , but this book really helped me to see the benefits . I have learned a lot from this book and would definitely recommend it for anyone else having trouble with this .	1
Paleo diet is one of my favorite diet of all time so I love to read paleo recipes and the recipes in this book looks very delicious , unique and healthy . I will check the ingredients and will surely try it one by one .	1

The food tastes good and is easy to prepare . The instructions are clear and there are many nice and clear pictures .	1
The book has much information as far as narcissistic personality is concerned . A very easy to read book . I can now handle people with this condition in a better and professional way , thanks to this book.You should have this book as it is the best I 've read in this category .	1
This was a short but , but succinct in it & # 8217 ; s information . I was pleased with the amount of information given . You could find this information on the web , but the information is here in one easy resource for you to read . The book is well written and contains a lot of information for the newbie to this subject matter.I do think the book is slightly over priced due to it & # 8217 ; s short length though , as you can buy a full length book , written by a professional , on these subjects for often just a little bit more money , and obtain a whole lot more information .	1
After reading this book I learned more about the disorder of anorexia and bulimia . It is a disorder that a person faces when they are trying to keep their weight down . They will consume so much food and afterwards will try to take the food out of their system by vomiting or over exercising . This is a severe health issue because its damaging the body by being malnutrition , or deteriorate . I work with teenagers and this book says that most teenagers are at risk and are highest percentage of anorexia . I would like to learn more so that I can recognize the signs , to be able to help in some way .	1

Have you ever wanted to see what the bad boy hero was like before he met his perfect match ? A lot of books make mention of his wild ways , but in Forever Steel , MJ Fields gives readers the tattooed brothers in all of their manwhore glory . In this prequel of sorts , we are invited into Cyrus & # 8217 ; housewarming and Xavier & # 8217 ; s birthday party extravaganza with all of the booze , women , and illicit acts you care to find and experience . We get the no holds barred versions of Jase , Cyrus , Zander , and Xavier ; they may be brothers , but they definitely have their own personalities and sexual appetites , and MJ does a great job of illustrating who they are individually as well as the bond that they share . Their view on women in this prequel is quite different from what they feel as they connect with the love interest in the series full texts . Women seem to be only the brothers & # 8217 ; playthings ; they use them for what they want and send them on their way . There & # 8217 ; s no overnighters , no feelings & # 8230 ; just the experience and that & # 8217 ; s it.Forever Steel provides a quick and sexy introduction to the Steel brothers and their friends . It provides a bit of their backstory in terms of their bachelor ways and helps readers to see how far they truly have come when their current story is told . If you love the Men of Steel , you don & # 8217 ; t want to miss seeing who they used to be.A complimentary copy of the text was provided by the author in exchange for an honest review.4 poison apples ( The Fairest of All Book Reviews )	1

This is just an insight to what the brothers are like . It 's a teaser and luckily I already read the other books .	1
I love the 4 brothers and the humor that goes on in this book ! They are all hot , steamy men ! The tattoos and piercings that they have make you want to find a guy just like them ! ! HOT does n't describe this book enough ! ! Thanks MJ Fields for giving another incredible read !	1
I have to say I am so in love with this series , let me just say that author M.J. Fields left me speechless once again , when I started reading this book I could n't put the book , this is the perfect pre-quel to the series , and if you have n't read the series get to it , you gone end up loving it , I am gone keep this short and sweet since I do n't want to give anything away.The story begging with the brothers , Cyrus , Jase , Zandor , and Xavier , Cyrus just bough a house on the beach , and they are getting everything ready for Xavier birthday party , while they waiting for Xavier , Cyrus is writing down the house Rules No shoes , No sleepovers , and no staying in late , once they have that out o the way the fun start , during the night you get to read about what each brother is doing , during the party and into the next day.I love it how each brother still have their own attitude , and that they do n't care what anyone else think , and love the way they talk it remind me of when I used to leave in NJ.I really love and enjoy reading this book . Author M.J. Fields THANK YOU for this awesome amazing series and this great awesome characters love it . This is the one series that you really need to read .	1
I agree w Jennifer Hines , the quote of the book is defiantly what the book is about . It tries to have character and a plot but misses . ok read	1
this book was awesome . it gave me the in sight to Jade and Pam 's so called relationship before Carly ... .Also with those hot Steel men who could go wrong	1
Love this series ! I even like Elijah . He has been through a lot and it sounds like his father is some kind of crazy tyrant or despot . I 'm thinking along the lines of Saddom Hussein . He really sounds evil . I like Elijah and Natalie together and really hope she can turn him around . I do think there is a chance for them . I just got the 4 th book and now I have to decide if I can wait til the box set comes out . Great Book , and it is hot . He is a little finish and takes over Natalie 's life and is very controlling . But as their relationship sort of grows , you get little glimps s of something deeper and better for them . You should read this book . It is really good .	1
CLAIMEDFirst off I have to say I have never read a erotica book . I was always hesitant cause the one time I tried it was the absolute worse book I could n't even finish it . Sex is fabulous in a book if written correctly . There must be a plot that includes sex not sex filled in with boring story . I was initially drawn in to getting this book by the cover . It was intriguing . The author told a fabulous story one so it left me screaming at EJ wanting to strangle him then at Natalie for allowing that pompous jerk treat her that way . The story was very well written with a seamless plot and great character development across the board . This was such a fantastic read I could not wait to read the second book . I . Highly recommend this book if you are looking for a sexy , thrilling , and refreshing adult book . Do n't let the butterflies fool you EJ is no innocent man.TAINTED.I did not think the author was going to be able to follow such a intense and exciting book like Claimed . But this author did not disappoint me . You start to feel more for the characters still wanting to throttle main character EJ . The book flows seamlessly into this second installment of the serial series like there was never a break between books . Natalie is growing as a character you can see the progression as the scenes develop . I am exited but scared for book three knowing it is called & # 34 ; Crushed & # 34 ; . I truly love the different designs on the cover . These books are hot but they are strongly backed up with a fantastic and intense storyline . I highly recommend this series to you my opinion better than 50 shades of grey . Great job to the author on a fabulously well written bookCRUSHED.The story picks up right at end of Tainted without missing a beat . This author does n't know what a fabulous and addicting story that they have created . This story is intense and full of emotions . I now have come to love the character EJ now that we are beginning to know his story behind the reason he is a JERK . Oh yes I said that . Yes there is fabulous sex scenes in this book but the story is such a amazing read it balances everything out . I so ca n't wait for the next book it 's like a drug and called & # 34 ; 101 Nights CRACK & # 34 ; . I wish I was able to reach through time and space to pull book 4 out so I 'm not left with this tremendous book hangover . I highly recommend this story to anyone that enjoys a spicy hot and intense storyline . I received a complementary copy in exchange for a honest and unbiased review	1
I was given a & # 34 ; Complimentary copy provided by the author for an honest review & # 8221 ; .All I have to say is WOW , If you are a 50 Shades of Grey Fan , then you will totally enjoy these books and the books to follow.I 'm not a spoiler kind of reviewer , No regrets reading this Series ! ! ! ! ! SE Reign has blown my mind out the water ! ! ! It 's hot sexy , erotic , and it has a great story behind it , yes it has a plot . I just ca n't wait to see how it all pan 's out for Elijah and Natalie.Claimed , I must add that you will love to hate Elijah , and just love Natalie.Her characters were so down to earth , and they are total opposite 's , easy flow read , keeps you turning those pages.Tainted , After their unconventional encounter , and arrangement set in play . The games begin , with little trust between the two.Natilie is a woman of value , and good natured in everyway , while Elijah is a spoiled billionaire accustomed to getting what he wants . Elijah starts to show more interest in Natalie than he would like to admit , her raw beauty and innocence has captivated him , but he is still a jerk . As Natalie finds herself falling for this arrogant man , she see 's the potential in him , she see 's the soft side of him , although he always manages to ruin it with just a set of words.Crushed , The tempurature rises even more so in Crushed , The chemistry behind Natalie and Elijah is so strong , they are both torn between their feelings , and the secrets that are being held between them.Elijah has become more attached to Natalie , that his original agreement has changed , this is where the plot really thickens.Awesome twist , secrets that are being held , undeniably incredible sex , an attraction that will not be contained , and a cliffhanger that will make you want stalk the author for more.Too much going on that I truly hope the next book in this series comes out soon.It 's hot , well written , great story behind it all , anxiuosly awaiting the next ! ! ! !	1
I really like this serial . Each part sucks me in and I 'm speed reading to the end only to be bummed to have the story end once again . I love Natalie and EJ . I wish Natalie would find the courage to be completely honest with EJ and th as t AN would see there is finally a good sole who is 100 % down for him and not what he has . I ca n't wait for the next one to cone out .	1
I was gifted a copy for an honest review . While I typically do not read short books , I have to say this series changed my mind . These are well written , the story drags you in and before you know it , the book ends . That is very sad . I have a dislike/love relationship with Elijah , but then so does Natalie . I want his shell to crack open ! I hope SE Reigns hurry ups I need to know the rest of the story , the mystery is driving me crazy .	1
I received a copy of this book in exchange for an honest review.This series is amazing ! I love each volume more than the last . Excellent mix of hot and steamy , a touch of romance , and a little drama , with a touch of intrigue . Highly recommending !	1
wow Nat , finally ends up telling El . about the text . he keeps going hot and cold on her . now she is in a trunk with his sister and carrying his kid . what is to come of them now	1
I loved the first two parts in this series so this was n't a book I would miss.I loved the development of the story and it was definitely great seeing a soft side of EJ . There were still the steamy scenes but Natalie and EJ also really started to care for each other . It was also interesting to take a peak into EJ 's tortured past which explains a lot of his attitude and character.The end was definitely unexpected and I can not wait to see how the story will continue in the next part . I hope it comes out soon : ) If you are a fan of FSoG and the Crossfire Series than , you would definitely like this one : )	1
This book was just as good as part 1 . It clear up some of the questions that was left at the end of part 1 . I ca n't wait to read part 2 to have the other questions clear up .	1
Charmanie you did the damn thing ! PTM2 picked up right where it left off in part one..the plot continued to flow effortlessly..Kaiah and the gang kept me at the edge of my seat the entire time..the ending ? ! Omg ! Ca n't wait for part 3 !	1
What is n't with the women in this book ? I mean enough is enough . They always running off and not finding out the truth . They just come up with their own conclusions . Kaiah , I mean she needs to step back and look at what she do and grow up . It 's okay to be hot headed but not 24/7 . Deontae , I like him he is good for Kaiah . What is Carlos problem ? My boy Deontae can not go out like this . And why is Sharae even there ? That ending , I mean really if that happen why ole boy ai n't on the tape . All in all it was a good read . Just want these women to grow up and stop letting nonsense come in between them and their men . Kinda hoping for Orlando to stay in the picture .	1
LOVED this Charm . Side eye Carlos for bringing Sherae around . But Kaiah got him back with Orlando . I like Uncle Kasey , he get things done . So glad Sammy got what he deserved . Glad things are better between Kaiah and Dolly . Carlos kinda made me mad with what he told Kaiah , but I get where he was coming from . I shed a lil tear when Kalise told Angel about her having cancer and wanting her to adopt Keymani . Okay , so I cried with Kaison too . This book really brought out the crybaby in me ( I 'm a Cancer do n't judge me lol ) BTW Deonte really pissed me off . Like really Deonte ? You have more to lose than Carlos . & Oh . Em . Gee . The bxtch is back ... Ca n't wait til PTM3 is released .	1
Too much craziness ! I ca n't believe the relationship Kay Kay had with her mother . That was just too much . This book was just too good . The things in it made you really look at life and realize the things you could go through our what someone else may have went through !	1
This book was so good . I actually read it in one day and was disappointed when I got to the last page . The ending was a total shocker and I can not wait how everything plays out in part 3 .	1
Great read as always coming from Charmanielots of drama but good and the end wow ... I hope part 3 comes as fast as part 2 didKeep them coming : - ) : - ) : - ) : - )	1
I NEED PART 3 LIKE NOW ! ! How the hell is home girl still living ? ? I know LOYALTY is everything , but goddam Carlos ! ! I hope Tae beat this ish ! ! I do n't understand WHY Sherae 's in the picture ! ! Girl Bye .	1
I have not read the first series , but this did not make like this book any less . I admit I have read a short summary of The Legend of the Blue Eye series to complete my understanding & # 8211 ; but even without that , the book , the characters were well built and described by the author . A romantic story , created in a fantasy world & # 8211 ; really proved to be the perfect setting for a very nice reading . Devin & # 8217 ; s story , struggles kind of made me & # 8220 ; fall for the character & # 8221 ; , and this really kept me turning the pages on and on . Although I am doing it in a reverse order , after reading this book I think I will go back and read the previous series as well .	1
Right from the start this brilliantly imaginative book grips your attention and refuses to let go until the very last page has been read . We follow Devin who & # 8217 ; s just had his heart broken . Fate leaves him little time to nurse his emotional wounds before he is forced to go on a journey with a night human to who he is magically bound . Devin wants nothing more than for the bond to be broken and he hopes the trip will provide the answers he needs to be set free . Their collective journey is fraught with danger and emotions that ensure the reader is always kept completely compelled.I really liked the writing style the author used , it allowed me to vividly imagine each entertaining event as they unfolded at a confident pace . The characters were well developed and their emotions and motives were believable . The complex relationship between Nessa and Devin really added a fascinating extra element to the book that elevated it above your typical action fantasy pieces of work.Overall I found the entire book to be hugely entertaining . Lovers of adventure and good fiction in general will really appreciate this piece of literature .	1
Bought this book because I wanted a comprehensive yet concise introduction to yoga , not an overwhelming amount of information . This book does what I want it to . It tells you what you need to know and does n't waste your time with useless info . The book provides exercises that are geared toward making you more flexible , healthy , and fit . The book is written for the true beginner ( even if you 've never set foot in the gym ) . I found it easy to get started and stick with it . The exercises are n't so brutal you want to quit . The exercises provided are also varied so you wo n't get bored . If you have even a remote interest in yoga , pick up this book .	1
This was a quick , fun , and light read . It 's easily doable in one sitting . The premise behind the story and the idea of two brothers and one girl was extremely intriguing to me . I just had to see where the story line would take us - because quite honestly , I was trying to play out all the scenarios in my head . The story was n't overly dramatic or full of angst , but I think it had the perfect amount for what the author was going for.I really did feel like there were several twists and turns in this book that I did n't see coming . I loved each and every character and found myself invested in them and their futures . Ginny was a jilted bride who would then have trouble trusting men . She decided to take her honeymoon trip so the money would n't be wasted and I was pleasantly surprised to see her let go while she was in Vegas . Somehow , these men made her feel comfortable enough to just let her hair down for a single night . You ca n't help but feel bad for Dane . He always felt second best , even though it was due to his own faults . I really appreciated that he never turned into the jerk though , which could have easily been done in several scenarios . I 'd love to see more of him and his past in subsequent novels . Furthermore , I absolutely adored Graham ... he was just that sweet , light-hearted , romantic guy . I often times found myself wanting to roll both brothers into one guy because they were such opposites , but equally desirable . One was this creature of habit out to seek his prey , while the other knew what he wanted and was soft and romantic - but still not without his doubts and faults.The sex scenes were seriously freaking hot ! That menage scene in the beginning had me burning up ! On the one hand , I wish there were a couple more , but I can also respect not having the book be completely based around them so that there was actual content . I was incredibly grateful that the author wrote from all three characters ' points of views . It was so useful to be inside each of their heads so that we , as readers , always understood where their head was and feelings were . I also love a good happily ever after ! There was no cliffhanger , but I definitely wish I could see more into all of these characters ' futures ! I 'm hoping for more books in this series -- hint , hint ! This was my first book by Terry Towers , but I look forward to reading more by her !	1
While this might start out looking to be a m & eacute ; nage story it is actually a story of two people who have been wounded in love and are not sure if they are actually being chosen for the right reason , complete with jealous twins and sword swallowing cousins what more could you want in a romance tale.I really felt for Genevieve or Ginny from the start she refuses to let the situation get on top of her , going on a honeymoon without a groom is such a courageous act , but she does go a little crazy in Vegas , brothers but you know the saying what happens in Vegas stays inVegas , well that would be great except what happens when you need a cop in New York and guess who turns up , yes that would be the brothers , what 's a girl to do.Dane is a bit more of a player , but Ginny has him thinking serious thoughts for the first time , and Graham is recovering from his divorce because his ex was in love with his brother . Ok you confused yet , but do n't worry it all makes perfect sense of course you have got the cousin who puts drills up his nose but that is only a side issue.The characters all have a wonderful depth to them and I hope that there is more in the series as I would like to see them all in settled relationships , there is a HEA for Ginny but I 'm not going to say with who but just simply say that it was a perfect ending to a very well written story.I received a free copy for an honest review .	1
This story is great . Genevieve is left at the later by the guy she had been with for eight years . She really does n't know what it 's like be alone . So since she is unable to get their honeymoon refunded , she decides to go . It begins her discovery of who she is , what she likes and if the reason for the breakup was her . Her first night she comes across Dane Porter and the sparks fly . She learns a lot that night . But the next morning , she meets Graham Porter his twin brother . Both incredibly sexy and hot cops from New York . The rest I will not tell . But it 's does n't stay in Vegas . This is a great story about a women and two brothers all hurt by a relationship trying to work out the issues and deal with the present . But it also has some hot and steaming scenes that will make your heart race . I am absolutely psyched for the next book in this series . This author knows how to draw you in and keep you interested.You definitely do n't want to miss this one.I received this as a gift for my honest review .	1
This was such a fun book to read , loved every page of it ! ! ! ! ! ! !	1
I guess whatever happens in Vegas does n't always stay there . Dane was just ready for a quick lay with Ginny . But I really like Graham , he 's more compassionate than his brother Dane . I hope Dane is able to find love . He deserves it .	1
this story was unexpected- I thought for sure she was going to end up with the first brother she met since they had the connection first-hand but that goes to show you the heart has a mind of its owntotally unexpected but great ending..and cEnt wait until the other brothers story- finding his true love .	1
This is a really good book . I enjoyed it very much , the sex scenes did not leave you wanting ! I really hope Dane gets his story told . I recommend this book for anyone looking for something different . I will definitely be recommending it to my book friends .	1
Wow all desire www ants to do is escape from her captures and be free to live a normal life , after trying desperately to escape do she finally get what she want and if so at what cause ... . you will have to read to find out	1
Poor Desire her life changed in the blink of an eye . She had done and seen some horrible things in her short life . This book is a great read . Your emotions will run wild as you read at rapid pace just to know ... .what 's next ! ! ! ! ! I was not disappointed and I look forward to a sequel !	1
Jane Porter knows how to write great stories . I love the idea of a good girl with a & # 34 ; bad & # 34 ; boy , but in this case it 's hard not to fall for a guy who could have anyone he wanted but who instead wants a book girl . I also love how Taylor accepts herself as is and the potential she sees in just about everything.Knowing that Jane is a master storyteller , I should n't have been so surprised regarding the details and big reveal that will hopefully show up in the other Sheenan brother 's stories . I ca n't tell you how excited and eager I am for the next book and to get more glimpses of Taylor , Troy , and Marietta , Montana .	1
I know when I pick up a Jane Porter story I wo n't be disappointed . Beauty 's Kiss hit the mark in multiple ways . I loved the reading about Troy and Taylor . These characters were so well matched and had me finishing their story in one sitting . I 've enjoyed the Montana Born books and it was wonderful to revisit Marietta . Ca n't wait to read about more of these families .	1
Another great book in the Taming of the Sheenanas series . Troy buys the Graff Hotel to save it from being demolished . To celebrate its grand reopen one , the town throws a gala . Taylor is the new librarian , and is Troys set-up date for the evening . She does n't want to go , he is used to women throwing themselves at him , and he is intrigued . A wonderful , heartwarming story .	1
I 've always enjoyed Jane Porter 's books and this one was just as good as all the others . Ca n't wait to read the rest of the series .	1
This was a fabulous story . Being a `` book girl '' myself I really loved Taylor . Troy was a great character as well . And the two of them together was magical.Taylor 's friend , Jane , sets her up with Troy for the big Valentine Ball at the Graff Hotel , but Taylor does n't want to go with Troy . Considering the throngs of women constantly trying to land Troy , he is very intrigued by the fact that Taylor does n't want to be his date.This was a wonderful fairy-tale romance novel and I enjoyed every minute of it . I highly recommend this book to anyone who wants a feel good book to read .	1
It 's about time someone wrote a story about a librarian as the main character . Funny and witty is what I would call both the main characters - Taylor and Troy . It 's always nice to read about a character who does n't jump into bed with the hot guy on the first meeting . Refreshing and enjoyable .	1
Back to Marietta , MT for another fun story . It was so much fun to read and find out what the people from other books in the series are doing . Troy and Taylor were both great . Keep pulling for them to get together . I wanted to keep reading and not put the book down . Looking forward to the next book .	1
Jane Porter takes us back to Marietta , Montana for a sexy , fun , small town romance that 's impossible to put down . Troy and Taylor 's story shines and makes it well worth the trip . You 'll love this addition to the Montana Born Copper Mountain , series .	1
Sort of a modern day Cinderella . Librarian ditches her glasses and gets the hot billionaire hometown hunk . G rated . Sweet .	1
Loved the characters and of course the story was fun and romantic	1
What a quick , sweet read this book was ! I just loved Troy and Taylor , and loved watching their love story unfold . I & # 8217 ; m a big fan of small town romances , and the residents of Marietta did not disappoint with all of their small town color . I love when author takes the time to develop not just the main characters , but the secondary characters as well , and Jane Porter does not disappoint on this front . From the book club gossips , to the bartenders , to the local judge , you get a good feel for the characters and can just picture life in the small town of Marietta.Taylor is a woman who has had to grow up quickly , taking care of her brother who has an emotional disorder and has had a hard time staying out of trouble . She & # 8217 ; s happy with her books and keeping to herself , always being responsible and in control . I couldn & # 8217 ; t wait for her to finally let go a little and have some fun & # 8211 ; especially with Troy ! Troy has made a life for himself outside of Marietta , but still considers Marietta his home , even though his business and some bad memories keep him in San Francisco most of the time . When he meets Taylor he is immediately intrigued & # 8211 ; he & # 8217 ; s always had a thing for smart , book girls . It was fun to watch him take his time with Taylor and gain her trust , never pushing too hard , but always challenging her for more . He was also a total flirt , and I loved how he saw past her conservative front to the woman underneath & # 8211 ; and couldn & # 8217 ; t wait to get to know her better ! & # 8220 ; He wondered if she & # 8217 ; d ever spent a high school afternoon making out in the library . Somehow from her starchy expression , he suspected not . She struck him as the kind of girl who believed libraries were about books . Silly girl . He & # 8217 ; d love to teach her what dark shadowy corners in libraries were really for. & # 8221 ; I really enjoyed this story and look forward to more in this series !	1
I really enjoy Jane Porter books and this story was another home run ! I love the quiet librarian Taylor pushed into a dance with wealthy technology playboy Troy to benefit the town . This is a continued series in the town of Marietta Montana . Complex characters you cant help but fall in love with ! !	1
This is my first book about the Sheenans and I am hooked ! Not only are Taylor and Troy a great match , but their characters are complex and wonderful to follow . It 's good to see a librarian with a passionate side but keeping it classy . All of the other characters in Marietta are so great that they obviously can not be contained in one book . I look forward to reading more from Taming of the Sheenans .	1
I love everything about this series . Only thing that could 've made this book better was if it were longer ( it 's a novella ) . Ca n't wait for the next Sheenan book . Jane Porter is masterful at multidimensional characters who are in the middle of their lives and suddenly find themselves in a ROMANCE . The reader is never lost in details , but the characters are meaty . It 's real . I 'm especially loving these Sheenan brothers . JP also has a long story arc that threads through the series .	1
I love Jane Porter 's writing and have read several of her books . This book is wonderfully written . The chemistry between Taylor and Troy is fun and refreshing . I am looking forward to reading the next book in this series .	1
Absolutely amazing . This book brought me in from the very beginning . I loved it . I can not wait to read book two . The author did an amazing job .	1
I received this for a honest review and loved it ! This book was funny , sweet and had me smiling.Hannah moved to Nashville fresh out of High School to find herself . I liked Hannah a lot . She was sweet , funny , artistic , and witty . She was different , but yet vulnerable too . She would make comments and then realize & # 34 ; Oh shoot did I just say that & # 34 ; ... lolJason is the son of a famous songwriter trying to make it himself . He is good looking , confident , rich and always gets what he wants . And what he wants is Hannah . He is intrigued by her because she is different than anyone he has ever met.There relationship starts out fast . I was sucked into the things he does for her . God , he did all those things for her to win her and all he wants his her too be his.This book was a fast read and I was hooked . I ca n't wait too see where the next book goes in the series , but I want more of Hannah and Jason .	1
3.5 startsDisclaimer : I received this book in exchange for an honest review.Hanna Garrison has just finished High School and decides to leave her parents ' home and go to Nashville to get a job and be independent.This was a fun , quick , romantic , and light read . I liked that the story was different , nowadays we read a lot about someone finishing High School and then go to college , but in this case she did n't plan on going to College and I found that refreshing . The characters are likable , but at times I did think that Hanna was a bit too perfect , because everyone seemed to love her and everything that she did . It also seemed that everything happened very quickly since she arrived in Nashville - she was able to make friends , get a cool job , and also meet a hot , sweet and famous guy , all of this in a very short period of time . Speaking of a very short period of time , that 's also what happened with Hanna and Jason 's relationship , it felt like they did n't have time to get to know one another before they started getting very serious.I liked the comic strips element of this book , it was fun when she imagined what things would look like in a comic strip.This book made me smile , laugh , melt ( with Jason ) , and want to read the next one .	1
Glenn Malone & # 8217 ; s ( Author ) no nonsense ' here is what you do and here is why ' is refreshing . A complete how to guide to get great results without feeling like a fat kid trying to run . I now walk every day and find it has a positive impact on all aspects of my life from eating and sleeping better to looking and feeling better . Of all the weight loss guides I & # 8217 ; ve read this is the only one that I do permanently . If you just want a good exercise program or if you want to loose weight and have a good exercise program this book is perfect . You will have your program and you will know the research behind your program . A great buy ! !	1
( Honest review in exchange for book ) Dakota 's writing always evokes so many emotions ! I have loved everything she has written . Dakota 's snark and honesty come through in everything she writes and this story is no different . Max ... ..poor Max or should I say Fluffy ! Max is by far one of my favorite leading men from Dakota . He 's rough around the edges with a heart of gold . I do n't want to post spoilers so let me just say if you have n't read Dakota you should ! And this book would be a great start !	1
4-4 1/2 stars . Super funny . Had a different spin on the werewolf/shifter/mate romance . I liked the characters . Good alpha H , sweet h. I enjoyed the writing style -- easy to follow with entertaining dialogue . Good secondary characters . I will definitely read more from this author .	1
I have read all of the Accidental series and loved them . I love the humor and witty banter Cassidy puts in her books . This one did not disappoint .	1
I am a fan of this authors humor but I hate when I have to explain to someone about why I laughed out loud , I just tell them to read the book . Can not wait for more in this series . Love the characters and the town , want to see more . I highly recommend to fans of PNR , especially if you like humor with your romance .	1
You just have to read this book ! . The story line is fantastic . It hilarious , sweet , with just the right touch of suspense . Max is such a super hot hunk.He is sexy , sweet and funny . He is every girls dream . JC is funny and she loves animals she makes the perfect mate . Only one draw back she is human and he is a werewolf can she deal with this in time to save max from a curse ? . This story had me holding my breath in parts of it . I truly can not wait for book # 2 . I have not read any of Dakota Cassidy 's books before , but after reading this one I know I will be looking for more works by her ! . This book is money well worth spent ! .	1
So , let me start by saying that I am a huge fan of Dakota 's work . The BEST part of her books is the dialogue : sharp , witty , and full of attitude.In this story , JC Jenson decides that she needs to adopt a pet . A safe , cuddly one - like , maybe a kitten . Instead , she 's drawn to the back of the animal shelter towards a massive , menacing dog . A dog that is scheduled to be eliminated . This pulls at her heartstrings , so ( of course ) she adopts the giant dog/wolf mix . What JC does n't know is that Fluffy ( ha ! ) is actually a werewolf.Max Adams ( aka Fluffy ) can not believe he allowed himself to be captured by animal control . He 's on a search for his mate , thanks to a fateful bowl of chicken soup . After he lets himself be adopted , pampered , and fed premium dog food ( yuck ! ) , Max devises a plan that allows him to & # 34 ; meet & # 34 ; JC while in his human form.These two have immediate chemistry . There is no lack of entertainment , and I was cracking up throughout the entire story . I ca n't wait to read about the rest of Max 's ragtag crew and to find out what other paranormals are out there !	1
It was a quick read , but I enjoyed every minute of it . I laughed a lot and enjoyed the characters .	1
I never realized this really happens to girls.I felt her despair and hopelessness . To think there are evil men like that truly horrifies me . This book was well written and intense . I was happy with the ending and will read more of her books	1
Loved the book . I picked it up and I could n't put it down till I got to the last page	1
This is a dark and dirty , a gritty and very twisted tale of what most believe about MC 's . Tainted Rose actually portrays two very different sides of motorcycle clubs , there is the brotherhood where the club is the family and they all stand for one and one for all , this was the life that Rose had been born into and had grown up with until it was destroyed , she looks back with Rose coloroured glasses but it helps to keep her going , they may have done illegal things but they lived by a code , a moral code that they would n't break . On the other hand the DRMC The Dark Rebels Motorcycle Club was run by fear there was no brotherhood and their moral code did n't exist , and this had become her existence since she had been kidnapped two years before.I can not imagine what Rose went through in those two years we are given bits and pieces and we see what is happening now and I have to admit there were times when I just wanted to put the book down because of what was happening , how some body can go through that and come out the other side is amazing , but Rose although she is a strong character is just about had it when somebody comes into her life.We do n't meet Josh until well into the book but although no angel he is the sole surviving member of the MC that Rose had grown up in and he has a mission in life , he lives by that strong moral code and although the last member he strives to uphold the flag even if he can not wear the colours because to do so would mean instant death.When the two of them meet there is instant attraction , memories of better times and hope for the future . This ends on a happily for now , but there feels that there is definitely more to be told and that Rose and Josh 's story has not finished unfolding.This is a well written but dark tale be prepared for disturbing scenes and actions that cause humiliation and pain to some but others enjoy , but in many ways it is very realistic to things that are occurring in reality , life is n't always nice and sweet and it 's very easy to see how this could happen.I received a free copy for an honest review .	1
Tainted Rose is one of my first MC books ( I 've only read two others ) and I enjoyed it immensely . It 's well written , and we really get an idea of what is going on inside the head of Rose , who has her life turned upside down when she is taken by a frighteningly intense MC club and forced to work at a bar.There are many hot scenes in this book that teeter on the line , and that just makes them hotter.Definitely recommended .	1
I read this entire series in one evening . I could n't imagine putting it down and wondering what would happen as I fell asleep and I 'm glad I did . Now I can see how even a harsh beginning can have a beautiful ending . Two people alone in the world with only eachother ... and it 's more than enough for both of them . And to read in the epilogue that it 's based on some if the authors own personal experiences drove the story even deeper into my heart .	1
2nd book in the Darkness Trilogy . You have to love Rose , she has been through way more than most of us could take .	1
Powerful and creative , dark and sad , deep , disturbing , sweet and passionate those are a few of the words you can think of for this serie and especially & # 34 ; tainted rose & # 34 ; which is the sequel ! Rose 's story continues ! Her situation allows you a glimpse of the sex slaves trade and the underground mafia businesses that goes with it ! Fairly well written , you live every minute as if i was there ! Not for the sensitive souls because at times it can be very disturbing ! The scene can be a little raw ! But unfortunately it brings you to the reality of the subject ! ! ! Being a positive and a romantic i was thankful for the ending but just to go back on being even more frantic to know what happens next ! ! ! ! Addictive this book is a real tainted but oh so great read ! ! ! ! Two thumbs up	1
I received this book in exchange for an honest review.I am a huge fan of books featuring motorcycle club culture , and almost anything featuring a dancer of any kind is sure to snag my attention . I prefer my biker themed reads to be gritty and unforgivably & # 8220 ; real & # 8221 ; . This is that and much , much more . Warning , this is an extremely dark read . This storyline deals with a lot of explicit abuse , and rape , so please be aware that this book might be a trigger landmine for some readers . I personally love pushing my reading boundaries , so that was not an issue for me . If you are a fan of books like [ bookcover : Captive in the Dark|12513614 ] , or other non-consensual themed books , you might want this added to your to-read list.The blurb for this book says this is the love story of Rose , a stripper in an extremely bad situation , and Josh the last member of the Sioux Rangers bike club , out for revenge . I felt that was a little bit of misnomer because this book primarily deals with Rose and her mistreatment by the villainous Dark Rebel MC , and in particular Serge their Vice President . The majority of Josh 's part of this tale is important , but it is n't the force moving this crazy train along . Rose goes through so much at times , tears actually came to my eyes . This pushes past eroticism , and more in the realm of sexual torture . There isn & # 8217 ; t anything to & # 8220 ; pretty up & # 8221 ; what is happening to the heroine throughout.This is a great beginning of a new series , but I did have one small issue . I personally felt this book should have ended at about the 90 % mark , and the rest of Rose and Josh & # 8217 ; s story should have been picked up in the next installment . It made the wrap up feel a little rushed , in my opinion . That being said , this made for an extremely gripping biker read . I & # 8217 ; m really curious to see what happens next .	1
4:5 ****Oh my what a raw and gut wrenching ride . Rose an orphan from a defunct MC has grown up in a care facility in Quebec since her biker family was obliterated when she was twelve years old . Her Father 's enemies offer her a future of pain and sin of the like she ca n't even contemplate but she does n't have a choice if she wants to survive this hell on Earth . The author has gone out on a limb and wrote a gutsy and shocking lifestyle that reveals a really dark side to what most biker books only touch on . I applaud her confidence to say it how she did and weave a devastating drama filled with such a vivid tone of cruelty . I could n't put this book down and hated the bad guys and pray Rose will seek revenge on all the men who have torn her apart . I 'm rooting for Rose and Josh her knight in shining armor to ruin the filthy bikers and finish them all . Great story telling ... ... ... .	1
Seduces you instantly and takes you for a ride to the peeks and edges of love and sex . Do not read this book if you have a weak heart ; Consult with you doctor first to see if your heart can bear this story . Keep Tissue paper and Vaseline by your side .	1
Well written gritty and realistic emotional story involving a young woman growing up in a biker family . Witnessing her father 's murder and her family 's demise , Rose had to grow up fast and struggled to make a living on her own.With no real family left this young woman had no choice but to try to make end 's meat in short dead end job 's . Rose thought she finally might have caught a break and chooses to accept delivering a 'package ' for some big time cash , little did she know she got more than she expected.Now she is a stripper working for a big time criminal biker organization catering in drugs , alcohol , human trafficking , weapons and all deeds done dirty , cheap , and shady . Although she is strong she is not in control and just about to lose hope when along comes a savior from the past and just what she needs ... again.Josh Carter is that man , savior , hero , survivor and last member of the Sioux Rangers . He is on a mission , seeking revenge , gaining justice for the crime against his father , and taking back his soul-mate . He has come for Rose , his woman , and just in time ... again.Thank you Abby Weeks !	1
I ca n't lie . This was harsh . Do you want a gritty , dirty , real MC book ? Then meet the roughest Canadians you have ever met.It was hard to get through , but in a good way . Tainted Rose was n't candy coated , and I liked it ! Good job Abby Weeks !	1
Look forward to the next book in the series . We 'll written . Have read everythingThis guy has written . He does a great job . Ok ? There twenty words .	1
Good attention to detail and the plot moves right along . I hope a full series will follow ; the ground work has been well laid !	1
This was a good way to Begin the beginning of a war -enable your captors through your own aggressiveness to attack their own captors with the use of human ruthless and overwhelming combat skills .	1
Wonderful new space story with a benevolent alien who helps humanity which is in dire peril , though he has an ulterior motive . The author did a great job keeping the characters interesting and no obvious lack of continuity in the story.Look forward to the next book	1
KK I liked it . It had a different twist to it andI want to see us teach them that it 's a bad idea to Piss us off LOL	1
Excellent story . Will hold your interest and leave you wanting more . It is always a pleasure to find a new author .	1
This was a great book . The only thing that I was hoping for at the end was a little more about how the Kleese Empire felt about what had happened after there failed attack . Ca n't wait for the next book , this one I could n't put down .	1
I have just enjoyed reading this book . The series of events that are described in it are actually quite possible as to a way to start a war with a new population . I have to hope that this is the type of reaction such a terrible action would rise in the human spirit . I hope you enjoy this book as much as I have . Happy reading .	1
I really like 1st contact scenario 's and this one had more than 1 curve balls.Hate typing this , but almost too much action . There are so many threads I would like to see explored further - I hope the author runs them down . The & # 34 ; Kleese & # 34 ; are fascinating and I really would like to know the back story there .	1
A good gripping yarn , presented in an imaginary , .construcional manner , making for an urgent desire for a follow on.Aouthor , Author.Definitely ca n't wait for the next installment .	1
This is a great read and the first of a new series . Thrilling new space opera in its infancy , am awaiting the second by holding my breath . Hurry and write I 'm dying here & # 128125 ; & # 128516 ;	1
Now that on the edge of my seat please keep writing . I waited along time for this and please inform me when the next issue comes out . I love your writing style as it 's really a page turner and looking forward to ther final confrontation or ... ... ... ... ... ... ... . ? Keep up the great work and you 'll be getting alot of stars from this reader .	1
This was an excellent Sci-Fi book and I finished it in record time . The story while not far off from the slaver wars was very well done and I found myself really getting into the story . I hope there will be more to follow .	1
We 'll written and engaging story , pulls you in and keeps you turning pages . Looking forward to the next installment in a hopefully many part series .	1
This is what sci do is all about . This author is very good and I highly recommend this book . Need more in series right away	1
Great start to a series . Love books where humans and other underdogs turn the tables on the evil over lords .	1
Will Wright finishes up his trilogy with his best work yet . It brings a satisfying conclusion with space left over for more story if the author so chooses .	1
Wight does not disappoint in this conclusion . The lead up to the end is also as good as the other two Traveler 's Gate books too .	1
& # 8220 ; City of Light & # 8221 ; is the third book in Will Wight & # 8217 ; s & # 8220 ; Travelers Gate & # 8221 ; series . It appears that this may be the conclusion of the trilogy , although Wight does mention after the book that he may revisit The Traveler & # 8217 ; s Gate universe at some point down the road . In this third installment , The incarnations are free and one of them ( someone thought dead from the last book ) comes back into play and tries to organize all of the incarnations into a ruling power underneath his authority . Returning are our three central characters : Alin , Simon , and Leah . Leah is queen now after the death of her father and is trying to come to terms with her new position and the implications thereof . Simon has continued to train in the House of Blades and stands ready to fight the incarnations . Since incarnating in the last book , Alin has taken control of his territory and is struggling to deal with the conflicting powers that now rage within him.I enjoyed this third book , as I did the previous two . I absolutely believe that Will Wight is a talented author and I look forward to reading whatever he turns out next . To be fair , I must say that even though I enjoyed the book and the series , I am somewhat disappointed now that I & # 8217 ; ve read its conclusion . Not disappointed in what & # 8217 ; s in the book & # 8211 ; but rather disappointed in what is not . The story should have been much larger than what & # 8217 ; s contained in these three books . Alin & # 8217 ; s character is mostly abandoned for this third episode , appearing at the beginning and then returning at the very end to serve his purpose . The worldview and inner struggles of an incarnation of almost limitless power could have been a terrifically interesting side story in the book , but is instead completely ignored . The dynamic of Leah versus her incarnated father could have been a heart wrenching dynamic in the story and instead is very underplayed . But most disappointing in my opinion is Simon & # 8217 ; s story arc . He is without a doubt the heart of the trilogy and far and away the most interesting of the characters . Well , that may not be true . His combined story is the most interesting & # 8211 ; not necessarily just him . I was completely intrigued with the house of Valinhall . What lies in the rest of the secret rooms of the house ? With Simon as the & # 8220 ; founder & # 8217 ; s heir & # 8221 ; , who & # 8217 ; s the real authority in the house now & # 8211 ; Simon or the Nye ? Will Simon be able to retrieve all of the dragon & # 8217 ; s fangs ? What about the new masks that were made & # 8211 ; that supposedly held the power of the house but didn & # 8217 ; t have all of the negative side effects ? I could list a dozen more questions I & # 8217 ; d like answers to , but you get the point . It seems to me that there is quite a bit more to be told regarding Simon and his territory and I certainly hope that Wight will make the time to revisit this world he & # 8217 ; s created & # 8211 ; and hopefully sooner rather than later.Those things aside , I loved the book and look forward to reading Wight in the future . He & # 8217 ; s an excellent world builder that shows much promise .	1
This was a very short read but sometimes that is what I want ! ! This was ok but some acted very immature ! !	1
Always a good read from Cia Leah - everyone reading this will enjoy	1
This is a fun read ... ..but too short but it wrapped up nicely . Only gripe ? My name is MEREDITH : ) oh well ... ...	1
Dyre and Betty are really truly H/h . He rescues her , she recues him who cares . Dare I say it , they 're & # 34 ; freakin & # 34 ; adorable . The entire story had me either lol or drinking ice water . Heroic Abduction is a fast paced well writtened hotter than hot romance in purple . Outstanding .	1
This series is a great way to spend an evening . Each character is funny and the antics they get into lead to chuckles . The romance is hot . Way to go , Eve !	1
This is one of my favorite series by Eve ! They are big , over-confident , purple , and definitely in charge ... .just the way I like them : ) In this particular book Dyre has broken from tradition and chosen a different lifestyle . His planet is known throughout to produce some of the fiercest mercenaries ever to be seen . Unfortunately , Dyre 's true desire is to be seen as a hero , much to his parents extreme disappointment . He dreams of saving a fair princess and falling in love . His fair maiden turns out to be a lot less virtuous than to be expected , which leads to quite a humorous adventure ! A wonderful addition to this already great series ! ! !	1
Dyre , galactic hero and purple hunk , is always on the lookout for a new quest . Man-eating monsters , marauding mobs , or damsels in distress - he 's here to save the day . And accept the reward for his valorous deeds from the grateful populace , of course.For some reason , these rewards tend to consist of carnivorous plants or other similarly dangerous gifts , but that 's surely a sign of respect for his mighty prowess . Right ? I mean , it 's not like he destroyed their village on purpose . Or deliberately set their holy tree on fire . And how was he supposed to know that the woman was married to the chieftain ? She , like , threw herself at him . There 's absolutely no call to refer to him as 'the menace ' . He 's a gallant warrior for right and justice , darn it.In his latest adventure , Dyre saved a human barbarian named Betty , who 'd be right pretty if someone dunked her in purple dye , from a dangerous troll . So why is n't she properly grateful ? And why wo n't she do as she is told ? Her stubbornness keeps putting her in danger . How can he stay true to his heroic ideals if he has to ruthlessly slay all those who threaten her ? If he is n't careful , he will revert to his mercenary roots . He can not let this happen . Betty is his damsel . His princess . His reward for all his noble deeds . His happily-ever-after.Now , where is this confounded dragon he has to slay ? There has to be one somewhere , all the books he read as a child said so.Anyway , this has gotten a little longer than I expected , but as you can see , I had a blast with this book . So funny . Dyre is a great quixotic hero . There 's lots and lots of lovely humor , a nice amount of romance , and a few nice sex scenes . I can recommend this book to anyone who 's looking for some lighthearted romance.This is book 5 in a series , but it can easily be read as a standalone .	1
This erotic alien romance is an out of this world read that tickles the reader . I found the world fascinating and entertaining and the characters fun and captivating . I was totally engrossed in this enjoyable alien romance from beginning to end and since I haven & # 8217 ; t read the other ones yet , I & # 8217 ; ll not only be doing that , but I will be looking for more in this series . Did I mention that purple is my favorite color ? See my full review at : The Jeep Diva .com	1
Lots of laughs , chuckles and hot sex . Makes you want the next in this series . I could n't put it down . But what else is new ? This is a very talented writer who strives to entertain . She succeeds . Very detailed wolds and characters which hold true in each story of a series . I like it when a writer creates a world and sticks to the facts and rules as they put forth for a universe they created . Thanks Eve for another delightful read .	1
I have a very tough time NOT loving these big purple aliens . Whether they 're being mercenary and taking what they want when they want it or trying to be a hero , they give me a giggle.Frankly , Dyre 's desire to be good is hilarious . While he might have the best intentions , things tend to turn on him every.single.time . He accidentally burns things down , rescues damsels who do n't want to be rescued , and generally makes a mess of things . But he 's so darn earnest when he does it.Seriously , how can you not like a guy who gives his all like that ? And when he drops the good guy persona and goes all HULK SMASH ! on the bad guys for daring to lay a hand on his lady ... well , things get even more entertaining . For Betty , too . She gets all that protective rage focused on keeping her safe . It takes her a while to appreciate it , but when she does , she REALLY does.So . Purple . Everybody should give them a try . Mercenary or hero , they find a way to destroy their enemies and keep their special lady friends safe . Got ta love that ! -Kelly @ Reading the Paranormal	1
I do so love the purple guys . Great book ca n't wait for the next book be it purple or lizard I am sure I will enjoy . Thank you for a great story .	1
Heroic Abduction is an amazing read with a hot sexy purple alien that will have your stomach hurting from laughter . Filled with adventure , romance , hot sensual love scenes , an awesome heroine with an amazing sense of humor who is not afraid to follow her gut feelings , to one of the most hunky , funny heroes I could not get enough of this story.Dyre has decided to follow his own dream of becoming a hero and deviating from his mercenary heritage . This has driven his family so crazy they have pretty much disowned him.Our hero embarks on a quest to fulfill his destiny , only things does n't go exactly as planned . Basically causing more destruction and calamity rather than saving the day , Dyre is a little befuddle as to why those he has `` rescued '' seem so anxious to be rid of him . Hysterically Dyre somehow interprets their less than thrilled reactions as positive and wonderful . Even the man-eating plants he has been gifted with `` must '' have been given to him to show how `` only one as brave as he is could handle them . `` Obviously unaware of the saying `` no good deed goes unpunished '' , Dyre continues his mission across the universe , when he hears if a maiden in distress about to be sacrificed to a dangerous beast . Betty , our heroine , has been plotting to steal treasures in the lair of this beast when she is `` rescued '' by a purple warrior who has no clue he is spoiling her plans.Betty decides to stick with the hot purple hunk , despite her impression that he is somewhat lacking in the common sense department . After all there is something cute about the bug guy , even if occasionally turns out she is the one doing the rescuing.Betty makes a great heroine and match for Dyre , who is in need of a damsel in distress . Ever one to ignore advice and safety precautions , trouble and danger follow her . She is spunky , fearless , rebellious and to her surprise starts to find herself attracted to the quirky purple hunk . Besides , Betty is curious as to what all the big deal is about this `` mating `` business.The banter and dialogue between the two was hilarious , especially since they were both on such different wavelengths without even knowing it.Dyre finds he is becoming more and more drawn to the '' small `` barbarian '' who draws out his need to protect and even processes . Their attraction and romance grows throughout all the chaos.Their relationship becomes stronger with the many ( often comical ) obstacles and situations they encounter out in space , as well as dealing with his annoying interfering parents . Hot sexy love scenes seal the deal.Defining and redefining his own description of what a hero is , Dyre nevertheless is an extremely skilled and effective warrior . The authors amazing talent for humorous writing excelled with Dyre turning all his heroic attempts into success stories despite serious mishaps . I give the heroine so much credit for understanding his mojo and the wit she needed to go along with it all.A few new characters are introduced in this book . Dyre 's parents are so funny as the distraught parents of their mercenary pirate son going all good hero , and Betty 's awesome kickass , overprotective killer bird-like alien sister/copilot.Eve Langlais is not only an amazing sci-fy , adventure , romance author but quite the comedic wit . I love the world she has built of purple mercenary hunks and the women who love them.Heroic Abduction is one of my favorite of the series , they are all great reads . Reading them in order is a good idea as ties to the rest of the series are in each book.Do n't miss reading Heroic Abduction , it will put a smile on your face from ear to ear !	1
Fast paced , lots of action , humorous , and two adventurous characters ( Dyre and Betty ) who discover the greatest hero is the hero of your heart . Love this series , Eve has such a great imagination . Was so happy to read at the end of the book that there 'll be another in the series , looks like it 'll be about Clarabelle , Betty 's friend . Highly recommend this series and her cyborg series .	1
All I can say is : GET THIS BOOK . You need it in your life . Dyre is the most adorable character ever written in the history of adorable characters . I suggest you read these books in order as this is the 5th installment ( hopefully not last ! ) .I have a hard time choosing which of the 5 in the series are my favorites . They are each pretty different in respective ways . If I HAD to choose , this is pretty close to n & uacute ; mero uno . Maybe a close second or third place.I kind of wish this was a $ 6- $ 8 book to be honest . It 's just so perfect	1
She 's done it again ! I have read all of the books in this series and this is a strong continuation . I have read ALL of her books & she is definitely one of my favorite authors . I highly recommend this series .	1
I have never liked Excel . Not when I & # 8217 ; m still studying and when I started working . But there came a time that I had no choice but to use it as it was needed at work . I was completely lost , I found it complicated and the formulas and formatting I have to deal with make it even more difficult . But that & # 8217 ; s history . 2011 when I & # 8217 ; ve decided I have to learn using and even loving the program . I & # 8217 ; m planning to have my Excel updated so this book is a such a big help . Reading on , I noticed a few changes in the work area but the functions are basically just the same . Really helpful !	1
This is cutesy but nice . Traci and Dan realize that they are meant for each other , etc . My reason for four stars ? Chapter 16 . It 's as if the author forgot her characters or allowed someone else write the chapter .	1
Great read , even in April . Cozy , hometown feel . I felt like I was there , and enjoyed the view into the small Montana town and the Chicago , fast-paced lifestyle.I particularly liked the way the author wove the stories of the characters together ... Christian and Molly from the first book , Six Months in Montana , and this tale of Dan and Traci . Looking forward to seeing what happens next to Travis and isabella ! ! ! Sweet story , sweet ending .	1
Christmas is such a special time of year for giving and receiving the love of family and friends . The 2nd book in the Montana series is just as special . Leaves you with a good , warm and fuzzy feeling . Like coming home .	1
This book is the had a great story line ! I found the book both realistic and yet very enjoyable . I have read several books by Michael G. Thomas and enjoyed them all !	1
Another addictive series written by Tim ... I do n't think I 've disliked anything that he has written ! I 'm on part 2 of 3 ... 3 coming out June 2014 ... just when you think the killer will be discovered ... . DAMN IT ... end of part 2 ! Thanks Mr Tim for keeping me wrapped up as ever in that crazy , mad head of yours ! !	1
First off I need to point out that I am not a huge fan of novellas as I get extremely frustrated with having to wait till the next one to find out what happened . Just when I get immersed in the story it is the end so I usually stick to a series as they are my favourites . Having said that I am a huge fan of Tim 's and have read pretty everything he has written so that is why I am reading these books . Charley is such a great character and very different to his other series as she has the sight which is quite disturbing to literally see and feel the deaths of others . Tom is a good partner of sorts though he does have his moments where you just want to shake him but no one is perfect . I am really interested to see how this story progresses and as little titbits of information are revealed in each book , it keeps you guessing and playing amateur sleuth as to who the killer really is . I ca n't wait till the next one comes out .	1
I blew through Part One , downloaded Part Two and blew through it and am very impatiently waiting for the release of Part Three ! Need I say more ?	1
5 StarThis is an excellent book for young children . I read it several times to my neighbor kids ( ages 2 and 5 ) they both loved it , and kept asking if they could have the fish book again . It has a great moral about friendship .	1
Big Fish is an excellent children & # 8217 ; s story , a type of folktale written by Ahmad Amani & # 8212 ; and he did the drawings for the book as well ! Ahmad is a most talented man ; I myself ( even as an adult ) was captivated by the short story and I liked his drawings which at first seem rather simplistic but take on a certain charm that I really came to appreciate . Grownups will happily bond with toddlers and young kids as they read this book together and the vocabularies of young children will be enhanced as they read this book and discover new words . True , there may be one or two rather minor typographical errors in the book but they in no way interfere with the enjoyment of the story.At the start of the tale , we meet Big Fish who was very much alone without friends & # 8220 ; because it was so big. & # 8221 ; To make friends , Big Fish first tries to become a bad fish but soon discovers that it has become so bad that the smaller bad fishes had nothing bad to do and they reject Big Fish ! Big Fish then tries to be the best fish ever in the ocean but this only makes the other good fish jealous and so yet again poor Big Fish has no friends.However , Big Fish makes friends with the moon and it even jumps into the moon so they can be best friends , which pleases the moon since the moon had no friends , either ! Trouble starts , though , when Big Fish notices the moon becoming smaller & # 8212 ; and when Big Fish feels sad and begins to cry its tears fall upon the Earth making the very first rain ! Of course there & # 8217 ; s a little bit more to the story but I & # 8217 ; ll stop to avoid spoiling it all for you ! Suffice it to say that small kids and toddlers alike will be fascinated by this timeless story that essentially teaches that when you try to make yourself fit in to be accepted it doesn & # 8217 ; t always work very well.Great work , Ahmad ! Please , keep these fine children & # 8217 ; s books coming ! I only wish I had such lovely children & # 8217 ; s books when I was a kid !	1
The love of a real father has no limits ... this book is truly exciting all the twists and turns this young man goes through for love.. he represents the lengths a parent will go to save their child	1
I READ THIS BOOK WHILE AT WORK , I HAD TO TAKE A EARLY LUNCH BREAK . TO AFRIAD I WAS GOING TO MISS SOMETHING . I REALLY ENJOYED THE BOOK IT IS ONE OF THE BEST BOOKS I READ THIS YEAR . I THINK EVERYONE SHOULD GET AROUND TO READ THIS BOOK . IT KEPT ME GUESSING WHAT WAS GOING TO HAPPEN NEXT . A JOB WELL DONE ! ! ! !	1
That book was good as hell.I do n't have children but I know I would be like him.I love how he got help from her.I ca n't wait for part two.I could n't put the book down at all	1
Ok so i just finished saving sierra and i actually loved the storyline . It was n't your usual urban street fiction . The story started out very slow but it soon picked up . The lengths a great father will go to to make sure his child has a chance at a better life was mindblowing actually had me tearing up because i know as a mother the sacrifices I have had to make to make sure my kids are ok . I think that the two writers intertwined their own unique style of writing in this story in a way that you could tell the difference but it was in a good way . I love both authors and i pray that they keep the good books coming .	1
This book has everything in it . To see hope far a father would go to save a previous baby girl . Is Bryce gon na make it on time to save Sierra ? Or is he gon na a wanted man in Venezuela ? Great reading definitely would recommend it to my friends and family .	1
I really enjoyed the book . It was a slow start but I must say it 's a definite read . I did n't expect all those things to happen but a parents love for a child is priceless . Hats off to Leo Sullivan & Karmel Divine for this book . Ca n't wait for the next installment	1
I enjoyed this book from the very beginning , nothing compares to the love of a father . I 'm anxiously waiting on part 2 ! Good job Leo and Karmel ... .	1
Not my kind of book I read but anything that has Leo Sullivan attach to it I 'm reading , this is an excellent book I am open I ca n't wait for part 2 .	1
I could n't stop reading this book once I started it . This is definitely a must read . I cried a little . Everyone that have kids can definitely relate to the measures that was taken to save Sierra .	1
This book seems very similar to a book I 've read under a different title . Am I right ? Well anyway it was a good read I just do n't think it 's fair to your customers to do that do I gave it four stars .	1
This book was good from the beginning to the end ! ! ! I did not want to put it down ! ! ! Bryce is the definition of a real father that love his child . A father that will do whatever for his child even if he have to pay for his actions in the end ! ! It was never a dull moment in this book . I hope that I do n't have to wait too long for part 2 ! ! ! Hope that everything work out for Bryce & Sierra ! ! ! Great job Leo Sullivan & Karmel Divine ! ! !	1
Lesley Cookman is an artist when it comes to plot-lines . She is one author who keeps me wondering whodunnit right up to the end . This latest entry in the Libby Sarjeant series was really convoluted and the plot twisted back upon itself several times.This time the story will revolve around Harry , one of the liveliest characters in the series . His life has been a mystery . Even his life-partner Peter does n't know about Harry 's beginnings and we find out that this is because Harry does n't know himself where he was born or who his parents were.The man who helped Libby 's friend , Harry Price , get a start in life has died . Harry asks Libby and her partner Ben to accompany him to the funeral on the Isle of Wight . His friend owned a house on the beach there and they can all have a week 's holiday by the sea . Libby 's psychic friend Fran and her husband are also invited to vacation there after the funeral.When they arrive on the island they meet the cousins of the deceased and these three old ladies are really strange . They want Libby to investigate the death of their youngest sister who , they insist , was murdered . Add to this the fact that they seem to be hiding a grave secret and will not give a straight answer to any of Libby 's questions ! The friends soon learn that this secret involves Harry Price , and soon after he is being stalked and his life is threatened.Was the sister really murdered ? And what has Harry got to do with any of this ? I read this one from start to finish in one sitting . Highly recommended .	1
I have enjoyed all the Libby Serjeant mysteries . Lesley Cookman 's ability to bring the various locales to glowing life has me ready to move to England . It was fun to see the new locale and reconnect with all my favorite characters as they head off to the coast . The mystery was well put together with a few surprising twists thrown in .	1
I love the Libby Sarjeant characters and stories ! These are more adult & # 34 ; cosy & # 34 ; mysteries and I enjoy hearing about theparts of the countryside where they take place and the day to day life style of the characters . This one is quite a distancefrom their usual setting but invites you in nevertheless !	1

This was a quick love story & wished it was a little bit longer but you did a wonderful job ! ! My mom just got home today from rehab & even though she seems to be doing good it just hit close to home with having to care for our elderly love ones & you handled this with dignity & respect . So glad I read this book ! ! THX	1
This book touch me in so many ways especially caring for the patient and his son . Danielle and Darren found unconditional love with a little help from dad .	1
This book made me want to cry . It was that good . Darren and DDanielle I had a really good time reading this book	1
If you like Jordan Silver it 's just like the other books ... .alpha male , obedient ( sometimes ) wife ... .There are two books that go together to really get the entire story . I really like the epilogue ... if there was n't the epilogue with their oldest child I would have been upset and wanted a refund . Silver 's books are kind of pricey in my opinion .	1
Plenty of brightly colored artwork that put a smile on my face . Faye is a beautifully drawn and empathetic character , and I like the she is especially an inspiration for the more shy kid out there . ( I could have used that inspiration growing up , as I too was a shy kid who got teased a lot in elementary school ) . The book also contains this lovely rhyming poetry structure which was unexpected.Dragon Faye Saves the Day proved to be very appealing to both the little kid and the poet in me !	1
Everyone should read & # 34 ; Altered. & # 34 ; Even though set in the future and considered a YA book , the possibility of a situation such as this is not as far fetched as some may think . Taken over by the Grey Army , citizens are forced into Labs to modify food that is made to enhance certain characteristics in people , or make them complacent . Others are forced to abandon their homes and enter & # 34 ; nursing homes , & # 34 ; where their minds are altered . Still others are forced to join the Grey Army for the few privileges.I found this book to be intriguing and frightening . The writing is crisp , clear , and concise , making for an entertaining read . My mind wandered far enough to think of what I would do , faced with this threat . The author definitely has the ability to engage the reader !	1
A foreign corporation takes over the United States and puts it under martial law , controlling the population through a combination of military might and mutated food supply that makes those who eat it physically or mentally different . The story follows a group of teenagers who become separated then meet back up again later in their efforts to get unmodified seeds from the company to farms in Mexico.Pros:1 ) The characters are all very interesting and quite different from each other . They are recognizable as US teenagers in various forms.2 ) The story line is timely , what with growing concerns about companies that genetically modifying or treating food.Cons:1 ) About two-thirds of the way through , suddenly part of the cast can & # 8217 ; t speak without an expletive for a few pages . This is a personal pet peeve of mine . Do real teenagers curse ? Sometimes , but I do n't think it belongs in a book aimed at MG/YA audiences.2 ) The ending felt rushed and unsatisfying . If this is Book 1 of a series , though , that can still work.Overall : This is a good tale with interesting characters . With some parental guidance for younger readers , I think this would work well to generate some discussion about the current events around genetically and chemically modified food .	1
Altered is an excellent read . I was drawn in from the very first sentence . Though this book is a YA , I feel all ages will enjoy it . Ms Gardener writes flawlessly , her words flowing and picturesque.The tale is ingenious and very compelling ; once I began the story , I just had to finish it . Abbrey , the main character , is a spunky , witty girl and you love her from the beginning , willing her to win . With all we are facing in today 's society , this book hits very close to home . It really makes you think . What would you do if you were faced with a horrifying reality ? Would you be able to stand against it , risking all to save those you love and humanity itself ? I recommend this book to everyone . It is truly agem . I found myself feeling every emotion , just as the characters in the book did . I look forward to reading more from this very talented author .	1
I must admit that after my divorce I was devastated . With 3 children to look after it won & # 8217 ; t be so easy as when we were tighter . That is way I bought this book and I discovered a great compilation of advices and ideas that certainly helped me . Now I & # 8217 ; m much more motivated to continue with my life and could understood that not everything in life is so easy and we have to learn and grow up after making mistakes . This book contains solid , proven , actionable advice you can start applying into your life right away that is why I recommend it !	1
Received this book from story cartel , for my honest review.This is a very interesting way of doing a book , with all the unexpected life lessons.Sherlock Holmes is a very good detective , this book brought it into a more modern times.Most of the classics should be used in the school room , like we were growing up.Very anxious to read the rest of classics .	1
I love choosing fresh vegetables and fruits in the market and now I have so many great ideas for recipes . I always wanted to try and make things with vegetables I normally don & # 8217 ; t use like artichoke or fennel . reading this book it made me want to be more diverse with the ingredients I use . Especially trying new vegetables , herbs and fruits	1
I love this book What a great idea ! A book that is organized by ingredients such as vegetables and fruits . It gave me so many great ideas for healthy recipes that contains all kinds of vegetables and herbs . That 's great !	1
I am a meat eater but I 've been searching for good vegan & vegitarian recipes . I 've been trying to cut back on my meat & wheat consumption . I have much more energy now . The problem was lack of decent recipes - I got in this habit of cutting up giant bowls of European cucumbers , orange bell peppers , carrots , celery & 1/2 avacado . This is a great midday meal and I 'm fine with it but come dinner time I need something tastier . This book has a great mixture of raw recipes , salads , slaw , soup and many other cooked meals . I ca n't say enough good things about it .	1
I 'm not a vegan but I 'm trying to eat healthy food . The variety of recipes in this book encourages me to eat more vegetables , fruit and herbs . It definitely made my meals healthier . Truly recommended .	1
I love veggies and this book gives the best recipes when it comes to using the most healthy ingredients . The pictures are well captured and works well with the formatting . I loved the guacamole recipes since I have been wanting to make one myself . The artichoke ones are also amazing .	1
I was immediately drawn to this book by the highly imaginative sounding plot . It was enough to convince me to buy it and I & # 8217 ; m so glad I did . I found this book to be completely engaging , from the very first page to the last my attention was completely held as I followed the adventures of Silas , an alien who finds his consciousness placed inside a human . That & # 8217 ; s just the beginning of his problems though as the Nazis end up capturing him with the intention of extracting information about alien technology which they hope to use to gain world domination.Cleary this isn & # 8217 ; t your average fiction book but I found it to be refreshingly original . The plot moves along at a confident pace that allows the characters and story to develop whilst still being fast enough to always hold your attention . Each scene is well described allowing for you to vividly imagine the intriguing events as they unfold . All in all I & # 8217 ; m impressed . Clearly a lot of time and effort has been put into the creation of the book and the outcome is a story that will captivate you and live long in the memory .	1
This book is totally awesome . I have never read a book quite like this and I loved it . It grabs you from the start and does not let go till the end and even then your mind does not forget . The story line is incredible and so intense , moving from 2 different stories which combine as one . The characters are wonderful and the writing is clear and easy to follow . It is obvious from the history shown that there was a lot of work that went into this book . The author A. L. Burgess Jr. is brilliant and his imagination is outstanding . This is one of the best books I have ever read . I want more ! I strongly recommend this book to everyone	1
In & # 34 ; Children of Na & # 34 ; , A. L. Burgess , Jr blends science fiction with history in a very creative way and consequently , creates a story that is both captivating and unique . Although I 'm not the biggest fan of science fiction , I would be being disingenuous if I did n't admit that I thought that this book was one of the coolest books I 've come across in a long time .	1
Great book , especially for those who already are familiar with the law of attraction , the secret principles , etc . This quick guidebook reminds you of the key points to elevate yourself to success in all areas of your life . For those who are not familiar with these concepts , this is an excellent introduction and worth reading .	1
I love reading motivational books and this book : & # 34 ; Keys to success : A spiritual guide to Create your own Success & # 34 ; is one of the best . It 's short , straight to the point . Author talks about meaning of life , finding your life 's purpose , how to stay positive , how to organize yourself and even how to rise up from failure.Need something inspirational ? Get this book .	1
Usually these books are something that in skeptical of . But in this book the author actually delivers value for the money . I even found myself taking notes . Solid place to start .	1
I still love to read these types of books . We will always take a little something that motivates us for the day . I loved this book and especially this chapter : & # 34 ; Organize Your Way to Success. & # 34 ; Very well done .	1
The Sydney Rye series just keeps getting better and better ! I feel like the first five books , while each a great read , have built up to what this series is going to be about , starting in book 6 - ca n't wait for that one !	1
Sydney , Blue and the gang are back . Sydney is stronger than ever but still unsure about who to trust . Mulberry is working for Bobby Maxim and she KNOWS she doesn & # 8217 ; t trust him . But when Bobby invites her to help in the investigation to prove that Hugh ( her dead brother James & # 8217 ; boyfriend ) was framed for murder she has to do it.THE DEVIL 'S BREATH is the latest in this dark often quirky mystery series and is just as good as the previous installments . The author keeps you guessing from one moment to the next . This is a fast paced can & # 8217 ; t put down till you finish book .	1
The sweet novel , & # 8220 ; Hope , & # 8221 ; takes place in a small nursing home , which is part of a large syndicate of such places . The governing board of the parent company , more concerned with the bottom line than with individual patients , takes care to standardize rules in such a way that the local director in charge has very little flexibility . Thus , the elderly residents of & # 8220 ; Rest View & # 8221 ; feel forlorn , forgotten , and crushed under the stifling sameness of the bland meals and regimented routine.Prizewinning author Robert K. Swisher , Jr. has created a colorful and amusing palette of characters : Harold , the loveable retard with the mind of a six year old and heart full of love and hope ; Nurse Steal , for whom the residents take the place of a family ; Bertha , age 93 , whose mind has failed to the point where she thinks her teddy bear is her baby ; George and Henry , two grumpy old men who squabble over their daily checkers game ; Mr. Fisk and his buddies , who long to get a Playboy magazine and who race to see who can escape the farthest into the parking lot before the orderlies catch them ; Martha , the brains of the outfit who hatches up a scheme to stage a rebellion ; the uber-religious Grace Brethren , who quotes the Bible and refuses to join in the fun ; and several other equally amusing and loveable old folks.In preparing the characters for their greatest challenge , Author Swisher sprinkles pearls of wisdom throughout his residents dialog . & # 8220 ; We just hang on from day to day and before long we no longer look to the future for anything but another day . We plod along and ignore everything that is going on around us , as if by ignoring , all the bad will go away. & # 8221 ; Nurse Steal says , & # 8220 ; A good and caring God would not curse anybody to time eternal in hell . Why [ has ] man struggled so to survive and find meaning in life when in most instances life was just a riddle that had no answer , or at the very least , an answer that changed while the riddle stayed the same. & # 8221 ; Betty Frost says , & # 8220 ; & # 8230 ; I suppose we spend our time going from one useless dream to another . Dreams we know that will never be fulfilled , dreams that in truth only take us farther and farther away from the truth. & # 8221 ; Harold , the loveable simpleton , has a great personal secret . He believes that he can transform into a bird and fly . In time , a few of the residents begin to believe it & # 8217 ; s true , and so they prevail upon Harold to hold flying classes . The men , especially , begin to have a spark of hope , that flying will be a means of escape from their perceived captivity.Martha Dearheart , sensing the loss of hope among her friends , calls a meeting for the purpose of developing a list of their demands for change . Martha thinks , & # 8220 ; Everyone looks lost & # 8211 ; lost in a world where no dreams for the future can exist . Wishing never did anybody any good , only action makes change. & # 8221 ; I am sure most people never think about living in a rest home until they are in one . Somehow people have forgotten life is love and hope and not fear and control. & # 8221 ; The resulting list of demands are simple enough : more variety in their meals , a birdbath , a small garden , real plants in the day room , the privilege of going outside without a nurse , and -- the most outrageous -- flying classes taught by Harold . Thus , the stage is set for conflict and resolution . What happens to their demands . Will the residents learn to hope and dream ? Will they escape their mundane existence ? Will they learn to fly ? I can imagine this book being made into a movie , with plenty of laugh lines and many character parts for Hollywood & # 8217 ; s aging actresses and actors.Recommended reading.Dorothy May Mercer , Author/Publisher	1
Wow , what a roller coaster ride of emotions Mr Swisher takes us through . Boredom , despair , uselessness , loneliness . The struggles of the state , welfare of our loved ones , plus their dignity and the need to interact and have fun ! The characters are wonderful . I could see many people reflected in these diverse men and women . You will see friends and relatives with some of these traits . The antics of some of the men are are hysterical . The women heartfelt . Harold is such a joy ! I HOPE I will recall this sweet book often as I approach getting older so that the importance of hope never fades from my life .	1
I liked this . I just have always had an issue with the ( view spoiler ) thing . I actually went between two and three stars because of this . I also think that the author went a little to far on focusing on the ( view spoiler ) . Okay we get it she is chubby . Describing certain things could have been left unsaid . It is a quick HOT read so if you wan na read it . I am not sure you will feel the same as I did when I was done .	-1
When I reviewed the first book , I said it was too predictable , and the same goes for book two . The Government is bad , FEMA is a tool to use against the & # 34 ; people & # 34 ; . Those & # 34 ; so and so 's & # 34 ; at the UN are willing partners with the evil Constitution hating liberal Government guys trying to take over the good 'ol US of A ... ... .. And not to be forgotten , the heros are all male and the women melt at their feet . Save these books for the & # 34 ; bunker & # 34 ; as if you ever have to seek its protection , you 'll soon be bored enough to read them .	-1
This was a & # 34 ; catcher & # 34 ; from the first chapter Enough conflict and angst for the whole book2ns book was just ok. Hope the 3rd is better	-1
I have read 'Death in the Beginning ' , 'Three Keys to a Murder ' , and 'Indisputable Proof ' and , while the first was different , I loved the other two . I was really sad to read the blog about their new book 'Manipulation ' which has the f word and descriptions of graphic sex . I have been waiting to borrow 'Evil in the Beginning ' , a second book with the Samuel character only to find the s word and then 56 percent of the way in - the f word when no foul language had been used in the other books listed above . Gary and Vicky , I am so disappointed that you have added foul language when I trusted you and highly recommended you to other readers and my family . Now I have to go back to them and tell them to cross you off as great authors . I am a Christian and absolutely do not want friends and family to think I would read books like Evil in the Beginning and definitely not even consider Manipulation . Yuk . Now I have wasted hours of reading a book I ca n't finish which is the second in a trilogy so now I wo n't get to see how it all ends and I have to wait until next month to borrow another book . What a waste of talent .	-1
I enjoyed the first book ... .hoping that it would just get better with the second one . I had a really hard time completing this book because of how repetitive it was.In every other paragraph it had to tell you over and over that Diail was an alien called a Hunter , living by some alien code , bonded to Kimi , how foggy his head was from being dropped on his head , etc . Okay , we get it . Does not need to be constantly repeated.Poorly written . Story line would have been fine if tweak a bit and written a little better .	-1
This book was a & # 34 ; soapbox & # 34 ; for the author . Although I think a lot of books accomplish this ; this book was just too full of the author 's message . The story was dragging all through the book and you just get tired of waiting for the mystery to be solved . Then as it is solved , you are disappointed with the manner that takes place . I bought this book on Kindle from Amazon but it was a disappointment .	-1
I ca n't say I liked this book at all . I do n't usually post negative reviews , but I found myself paging through three or four pages at a time to figure out what the heck was going on . While I was doing that , I found I did n't miss anything at all . If you are getting many & # 34 ; rah , rah I loved this book & # 34 ; reviews , they obviously have not read a really exciting mystery .	-1
The concept had lots of potential , but the execution was flat . The characters were preachy ( not in a religious sense ) and just plain strange . Most of the time their actions did n't make much sense . Even the detectives thoughts and actions were a little off.The book ends with a teaser for the next mystery , but I wo n't be checking it out .	-1
The characters were not well developed . The storyline was too predictable . Everything was tied up too nicely to be believable . Not a series I would follow .	-1
I got bout halfway through before I decided I could n't read anymore . I 'm p'od that I paid for this nonsense . Out of all the romance books I 've read the female heroine in this bopk was the most annoying person EVER ! ! ! ! ! I did n't finish and I wont finish . READ REVIEWS FIRST . all in all this book SUCKED .	-1
I was About to purchase this author 's new book ... and then , I read his author page.Absolutely a TURN OFF from desireing to read his works : '' When he is not writing ( and even sometimes when he is writing ) , Author Fox Lee enjoys fast music , craft beer , hot women and spicy food and not necessarily in that order . `` I see why he wrote about `` The vile atrocities performed by the Nazis ... '' and no longer desire reading his work.The point being - GAG - get OVER yourself . THIS sort of thing looks like a poorly done ad in a singles site , NOT an author description page . And , if it WERE in a singles web site ... he would n't be getting any responces , and , would probably be wondering `` WHY ? `` In other words ... anyone who thinks THAT is alright to put on their author page is NOT someone whose work *I* intend to pay for . It is simply NOT `` my cup of tea '' .Full Author Page Description : '' Inspired by an earth-shaking nightmare which spawned the story line for Into the Darkness , the writing of The Legend of Shadow and Light began in 2003 . After more than ten years of revision , Into the Darkness was released in early 2014.The Legend of Shadow and Light is a fast-paced and gritty journey , which stays true to its heavy metal-inspired roots while providing fascinating alternative history themes which offer explanations for the death of Adolf Hitler , the mystery of the Bermuda Triangle and even the basis for modern religions.When he is not writing ( and even sometimes when he is writing ) , Author Fox Lee enjoys fast music , craft beer , hot women and spicy food and not necessarily in that order . `` As an aside : I TRIED to leave this as a comment in the section of his author 's page but it would n't load . So , here it is , a BAD REVIEW about his choice of describing himself .	-1
The storyline had a good base but there was n't much excitement . The middle/end of the book started to become attacked by errors which made it hard to understand . I understand nothing is prefect and I usually can look past an error or two . Than as if the errors and lack of excitement was n't enough the book end with a cliff hanger so I do n't know what happens with Mike and Jessie . I gave it two stars because I finished it .	-1
It is good BEGINING of a story it is in no way an actual story yet . There are numerous grammatical and syntax errors . It 's like it was dictated to a voice recognition app and words were randomly inserted midsentence . Remember the days when these thing were edited and proofread ?	-1
Too short to get a real sense of how to rate it . I guess I would have to buy book 2 .	-1
I am giving this book 1 star but it has the potential for 5 stars . What is wrong right now is that the author is well intended but misinformed . And there is only ONE Judge that I will accept to arbitrate between us ( if he accepts binding arbitration ) and that is a GLUCOSE METER.You can not possibly get correct results with mistaken ingredients . And nobody can duplicate these recipes if we are given fuzzy instrctions . '2 large bananas ' is both a fuzzy instruction , and a mistaken ingredient . Correct would be , for example , '300 grams strawberries ' . 'Granulated sugar ' is so mistaken as to make me wonder if the author knows anything at all about diabetes.The ultimate Judge of whether or not these are good recipes is a Blood Glucose Meter . I challenge the author to a duel , where a blood glucose blood test will be our weapon and a Glucose meter will be the Judge . There are some very good recipes in this book , but a cookbook for diabetics can not have some good and some bad recipes . Some of these recipes will raise blood sugar to 130 or 150 mg/dl or even higher and that is unacceptable .	-1
The author needs to brush up on grammar , tense and proper conjugation of verbs . I could understand missing an error here and there but the books are rife with errors . Not sure what age group the author was aiming for , some character development was lacking and some plot devices were a little tough to believe . Armed guards keeping students prisoner at a middle school run by a maniacal doomsday prepper principal ? With polish and a thorough grammatical editing the story could easily be a four star ranking . I would encourage the author to work on a revision .	-1
This & # 34 ; installment & # 34 ; , I have to call it installment because it is definitely NOT a book , ended at 81 % in my kindle ! ! ! ! I get very aggravated when I pay for a non existing 19 % ! ! ! ! ! ! I bought this thing only because I was too invested in it , not because the author deserved it . She is milking it for all its worth , dragging on and on with her & # 34 ; installments & # 34 ; that give 2 hours of read at $ 2.99 a piece , with no freaking end in sight ! ! I do n't know who are these people reviewing and giving it 5 stars ! ! They must n't be great readers , that 's for sure ! ! This 4th installment ended abominably and there is no mention of another follow-up , which at this point I would n't buy even if there was . I am appalled by the practices of this author and unfortunately too many others.If you want a good piece of advice , save your money here and look for something better ! ! ! Look for an author that respects the readers enough to give them their money 's worth and not just take them for a ride laughing all the way to the bank . Shame on them ! !	-1
this is not worth buying . Nor worth reading a waste of time ! This is not a love story ... This is basically a LUST story . the heroine is just there to serve sex for free ! almost all the chapters talk about sex . Plus hey , the guy is a billionaire . the ending ... . the guy is working for the girl ? what the heck ! ! ! what will happen to his billion dollar business ? Not realistic ... ..	-1
My title says it all- unremarkable- a very predictable story . Involves cute , crazy elders matching up their children . I wo n't get any more of the books in the series .	-1
I wanted to like this book..narrated from the cat 's point of view , but overall it was boring and lost the cute factor very early on . Save your reading time for a book more interesting .	-1
I feel like one star books are becoming the norm.The first book was n't horrible , not good , but not bad . I do n't know what I was hoping for in book two , but my OCD has me finishing every series I start even if they are bad . I wish I did n't suffer from this , but sadly I do . So I found myself reading this book.Sara was a tough as nails , tell you like it is character in the first book . In this book that girl was completely gone.PoofInstead we have a whinny , dependent , weak , needy , annoying character . Do I need to continue ? ? This book starts off right where the first book ended . Sara is taken to Remy 's hide out where she is refused access to a phone , a door , basically her freedom . But that 's okay . She kinda likes it that way ! Right.. She has a warped sense of right and wrong through this entire book . She feels it was okay for Remy to kidnap her , to bargain to keep her , and keep her prisoner for weeks on end . I think Sara actually likes the attention . She likes that Remy has been obsessed with her for years , that he worships her , that he would do absolutely anything for her . It excites her.Disgusting.When she gets bored with that life she calls Jaxon up and asks for him to risk his life to come get her . When he refuses because she sold him out she gets upset with him and decides to start a relationship with Remy . BLAH ! ! Then she leaves Remy to be with Jaxon again ... Seriously ? ? ? Why Jaxon ? ? Why ? ? The only character I actually liked in these books is Jaxon . If he had never met Sara his life would have been peachy . She has screwed him over every single chance she gets . I feel if given a few more years she will definitely find a way to screw him over again . But what gets me is the fact that he is loyal , to a fault . He has given his entire being to this girl and is willing to overlook all the horrible things she has done to him.Then there is the fact that some of the scenes appeared to just be thrown into the story at odd times , they disrupted the flow of the book . I would find myself stopping and flipping back a few pages to see if I missed something . It threw me out of the story that I was already having a difficult time finishing . Do I really need the distraction of nonsense scenes ? Repetitiveness . It is my pet peeve . I absolutely hate books that repeat and repeat until I feel like I 'm being hit on the head over and over . Constantly there were sentences that repeated sentiments or descriptions . One that stands out is : & # 34 ; The quivering coke addict quivered ... & # 34 ; REALLY ? ? Cause who would have guessed that a quivering person would quiver . That baffles the mind . That is just one example of what the books is littered with.UGGH	-1
I read ignite and Burn back to back and I 'm exhausted . I 'm all for drama , angst , heartbreak and tragedy . Let 's face it , that 's just part of life . But this was a relentless cycle that NEVER quit and the HEA just really does n't come . You feel numb by the time it 's done . It was OVERDONE And about half of the turmoil could have been left out , the story more fully developed and the author could have still stayed true to the characters . At the end of the book there is a teaser about the next book that will supposedly explain why Remy is as obsessive as he is . That would have been helpful to ow in books one and two . I felt that way about many things revealed in Burn that could 've been shared in Ignite .	-1
I 'm not sure if this just a free promote for the full book , or if the novel is serialized , but I 'm also not interested in finding out either . Dull , predictable , and extremely cardboard is what this particular bit is . Plus both unbelievable ( NYC is on solid bedrock , last I checked ) and stereotypical ( terrorists are Muslim ) . To compound the latter , the author is trying to profiteer off the 9-11 attack , using it as the backdrop and expected dreary plot device . Not going to be bothering with this one .	-1
Nothing but a general gloss over of preparation ideas and skills . Got it for free so no money wasted , but not even worth keeping on my Kindle . Just no value here .	-1
I usually do n't read this type of books but it was free so why not . It was kinda of dark . I have mixed feelings about this book . I do not like that it leaves you hanging . However , it was engaging .	-1
I gave this book two stars because it did n't hold my interest . There was not much of a story line . I think the author could have put more effort into the details . That seems to be the theme of these books all sex no story . Editing was good , so that was a plus .	-1
I really liked the beginning set up of how the love interest 's met . In the end , there was barely any development between the two . There was barely any story there at all . Just a meet-cute moment then they like each other instantly and it 's pretty much over . Cute concept but no build up to a satisfying end .	-1
This was so boring I could not force myself to finish . I must have had a different book than the other reviewers who said this was great . I am sad I paid for this !	-1
Really ! Seriously ! This is just not it.This was a Waste of money and time.Do n't think I would be reading anything soon from this writer..	-1
I love Lynda Chance ` s books but this one fell short for me . Not in length but passion and self recovery . Katie was raped but she did n't seek any type of help to get over her trauma . Then she has sex with Zach and then everything 's ok and she 's cured ? I do n't think so . Also Ive read all of Lyndas books but this one is totally missing the alpha male I 've gotten used to expect . Zach should have made Kate get some help . That 's what a man in love does for his woman if he wants her healthy and whole.Overall an ok story but not great . It actually hurts me to write this review but I could n't keep quiet .	-1
This might get me killed by LC fans , but I can still be a fan and post a fair and critical review . I 've read plenty of LC 's books , have given most 4-stars , a few 3-stars , but this is the first time I 've rated one a 2-star . I just did n't care for it . I was n't pulled in by the main couple , and the romance itself was lackluster and even boring.All the hallmarks were there for a good LC romance : the gruff hero , the wounded heroine , the chance for a thrilling seduction , forced time spent together , and a bit of angst and anger , all of which are things I love and wanted to read . I just feel the story was a non-story , very repetitive and redundant . The characters spent too much time thinking and feeling the same things over again and again . That , and the secrets , became tedious.Also , given what had happened to the heroine , I think LC missed the mark on how this hero should have been , how he should have acted . Not the right kind of hero for this type of wounded heroine . When he told her saying 'no ' was not an option , I cringed . So much of their time together felt off and not fun and not romantic . And having said that , much of that was due to the secret the heroine was keeping from the hero . I can take a misunderstanding in a romance , if that misunderstanding does n't go on forever . This one lasted until the very end of the book . And by then , I was frustrated and over it.This had great potential , but it did n't deliver any true romance , any real heat , or any deep character . A total let down for me .	-1
This is a teenage bad run on day dream ... so totally far fetched ... no one talks like this and long winded and descriptive . The hole time I was waiting for this over dramatized sticky sweet Brady bunch family to turn into crazed ax murders ... no such luck ! ! This story did not move me what so ever . Tears do not make a deep emotional story and not the 20 descriptive words used to say their crying . Reality is harsh and can be really brutal . the scars that burn into your mind does n't leave you all trusting and ready to live all happy go lucky . The author really should see life as it really is ... .really see it , touch it , breath it , live it and then write from the soul ... .The real emotion over this should come from the reader . Unless he is the teenager day dreaming ... .	-1
It ended abruptly and is continued in another book . It did n't say that this was a short book that required another book to get the drift of the story . I do not care for books that end this way . They should have a complete story that will continue on not just leave you in the middle of the story .	-1
Boy meets girl , proposes an arrangement , girl and boy fall in love in 4 days and get married . No explanation of history of sister , etc . a lot left to ad to the storyline .	-1
Even for a romance the plot is dumb . This guy is a big CEO but we are suppose to beleive that when he finally reunites with his sister , he is so 'caught off guard ' by her questions that he makes up a pretend fiancee to protect his 'gentle ' heart ? Good one . So , if he is so easily 'caught off guard ' or intimidated , how did he get to be a tycoon ? And if his heart is so 'gentle ' , why does he bully the h so much ?	-1
The lovely thing about fiction is that it can be so unrealistic . I wish this had been a longer book because I was just beginning to enjoy the story . For a freebie it was n't bad . 1 star because it was too darn short .	-1
Free rubbish . Not worth reading . An absolute waste of time . The story has a weak plot and the author hurries through the narration like there was a huge price waiting at the finish line . Disappointing , to say the least .	-1
The story line is not new or especially innovative . Regular girl works for super handsome business tycoon who just happens to need a & # 34 ; fiance & # 34 ; to convince his long lost sister he is happily attached . The story idea had a few bright moments but was very short and had the main characters fall completely in love and becoming engaged for real in less than a week . Overall : too short , predictable , and a waste of time . I am glad it was free .	-1
Not a full book , but a short story with no surprises . I really am disappointed . This was a classic rich , gorgeous man falls for a beautiful worker at his firm . Not impressed !	-1
This book was funny . It had a lot sex , with acute story . I had never read any of this author 's books . I am going to see if there 's any of the author 's books are available for reading .	-1
Dante and nylah relationship did n't started until 66 % mark in the book . Before that it was really boring pages with filler unnecessary drama and dumb conversation . I understand this suppose to be a series I did n't feel no connection really between Matt and nylah or Dante or nylah beside lust , just was n't my cup of tea , instead of a series it should have been one book , I wo n't be buying the next book .	-1
It seems to be a somewhat poor adaptation of fifty shades of grey . It started good but quickly went downhill	-1
I received this book via Netgalley for an honest review.I can & # 8217 ; t resist a romance when sports is an important part , so when I saw this one on Netgalley , I thought that it should be right my alley . It was my first book written by Kate Donovan and unfortunately , I & # 8217 ; m quite disappointed . Let me explain why.First , while the plot itself is quite easy and classic when it comes to that kind of story , it & # 8217 ; s not the thing that bothered me . The plots and sub-plots are quite all over the place , sometimes exploding in all and every direction to the point that it becomes more & # 8216 ; difficult & # 8217 ; to follow or at least enjoy the adventure . It & # 8217 ; s a damn shame because it could have been really amazing . To be honest , I even think some parts weren & # 8217 ; t believable and even contradict other parts in the story.For example , Erica bothered me to no end . She was always changing her mind to the point that it wasn & # 8217 ; t even logical . I mean , I don & # 8217 ; t mind at all when a character is having trouble settling her mind and when she & # 8217 ; s fighting with herself when it comes to a guy because it & # 8217 ; s often thrilling to read about , but here it & # 8217 ; s not how it felt . In fact , I couldn & # 8217 ; t feel her at all most of the time . It & # 8217 ; s a big problem when it & # 8217 ; s the main character.Johnny is a good enough male lead character even if I couldn & # 8217 ; t see the real chemistry for a good part of the book . I missed it completely in fact . The author had to point it out through both characters & # 8217 ; words for it to be understandable , which is , once again , a real issue to me . Johnny won & # 8217 ; t leave any mark in my mind , I think.I really like the secondary characters like Bam and Decker . These two were awesome to read about , and I & # 8217 ; d love to read a book centered on them to better see their friendship and how silly Bam is and how sweet Decker is . The best kind of mix . Hopefully the author will write them books and maybe I & # 8217 ; ll enjoy it more if the characters are better characterized and if the plot is better polished or at least better built.Also , now that I think about it , I miss a higher stake in this book . Since the chemistry between Johnny and Erica isn & # 8217 ; t that obvious most of the time , a higher stake would have helped me to get into the story and then fear for the characters . It & # 8217 ; s just an idea , because I truly think that there & # 8217 ; s material for a good book , but it missed the mark for me . I always feel bad when it happens , almost as if I & # 8217 ; m the one who failed a book and not the other way around . I & # 8217 ; m weird , I know.So , obviously , I didn & # 8217 ; t like reading this book . Maybe you & # 8217 ; ll feel differently if you read it , maybe I was expecting too much or maybe I wasn & # 8217 ; t in the right frame of mind .	-1
This to me was the same story as the first book . Too much the same in the fact that it had too many errors and mistakes in it also . Sorry , I wanted to like it but it just fell short for me .	-1
I expected more , and thought the characters needed mor character , if that makes sense . yadda yadda yadda liked some parts though	-1
After chewing my way through several chapters , short as they are , I found very little about the main character that I liked . Noah was good , but overall the story was annoying .	-1
Sorry , but all stories are not meant to be told in 3 books . This is one of them . The first book was fine , but everything in # 2 and # 3 are a waste and a huge disappointment . Neither book added to the story . Do yourself a favor . Read the first book & # 34 ; The Agreement & # 34 ; and STOP READING .	-1
I loved boook 1 & 2 , again this another books that was all over the place . Not to mention the characters were to immature for professional adults that they were suppose to be . The author should have stopped this series at book 2 .	-1
This was an ok read with no excitement at all . The title of the book is what drew me in ; however , it seemed like it was the typical drama without a storyline . Not sure if I will read part 2 .	-1
I was so disappointed ! ! This book was slow paced just made me confused ! ! Really trying to see this woman not go bat sh -- crazy when the ex shows up . Then all these characters no meaning what so ever other than Connie . I have all her books and this the worse one I 've ever read .	-1
That sums the book up for me , although I admit I did n't finish it . I thought the characters were wooden . I am surprised at all the good reviews , I 'm glad I got this as a 99 center .	-1
This was a short story that was pretty blah . I liked that Madeline was true to herself and wanted to do right in God 's eyes . But after committing her life to no men or marriage , after knowing a guy less than a week and talking to him how many times , she ran off with him . I also thought the sister was way too harsh seeing as how she had n't seen her in years .	-1
This was fast pace reading ; lots of gore ( if you like that kinda thing ) , storyline not the best but it kept my interest .	-1
This was a free download but unfortunately has only trivial recommendations . Since we already use a lot of Oregano , there was n't much new to us .	-1
A shipboard story that has nothing interesting except a constant sexual imbroglio that is boring by its lack of complexity . Written by a ten year old .	-1
The hero went from being shocked to find out the heroine was pretending to be engaged to him to rushing out and buying her his own pretend engagement ring . Still scratching my head over that abrupt turn around . Not to mention that scene ...	-1
I am so incredibly sick and tired of these wimpy women . We have brains and backbones . We need books about real women .	-1
I read historical romances to lose myself for a couple of hours , hopefully with a decently written book . Not the case here . There 's some talent hidden among the coarsely written sex scenes but it was well hidden.The fact that Iian was aroused nearly the whole story just could n't get me to take things seriously . Some gross historical inaccuracies in speech and grammatical errors would have been taken care of by an editor .	-1
I read a review about this book and I ordered it because the reviewer was saying the female character was shy and weak and did n't take up for herself and the hero was mean . Im pissed becuse I got none of that form this book . The female character was bossy for a hostage she had a potty mouth and what did the hero do ding Ding you got it he just stood the and took it . I was really looking forward to reading this because I 've read books where the female character is bad mouthing the man that 's suppose to b a alpha male and he take the abuse like a little bit @ @ cause he horny and nobody will do but her . Please give me a break . I do n't mine shy women because her a the hero can grow together without all the denieing they feelings halfway through the book . I also like confident women who acknowledged her feelings and build on it . Im tired of the books where the female do something stupid and she gets called brave by everybody . Maybe its me I might need to stop reading for awhile cause all these books are running together with bossy women and fake alpha males . want a new scene .	-1
I love time travel romances and had just finished reading another one by a different author . I started to read this one eagerly but was very quickly disappointed as it became downright silly more than anything else . If you end up in the past , I would think that letting people know you 're from the future is the last action to take unless you have no choice . And a boy whose wounds are a portal that allows objects from the future to land at his feet ? I find it hard to imagine that such a thing could occur and that boy would not be burned as a witch himself . I wanted to see what would happen but when I read that part I just gave up .	-1
No characterization . Bad punctuation . Little or no intent of normal conversation from characters . I wo n't buy any other books by this person.Freddie Forte	-1
This could have been a great story about two great people getting together and falling in love , despite their trials and tribulations . This book kind of fell flat in my opinion . The real meat and potatoes character development was sorely lacking throughout this tale . There are also spelling and grammar errors galore . Then there are those things that just do n't make any sense whatsoever . For instance a baby is born . Is it a girl ? Is it a boy ? Once again , is it a girl ? The author would be wise to hire an editor before going to publication . I could have found this book intriguing . The subject matter was great . I love stories of pioneers and their hardships . I have enjoyed a great western yarn since I was a young child . This one just left me scratching my head .	-1
I like to read science fiction and I enjoy the occasional sexual encounter/situation . Sometimes the tension really adds to the story . In this case , it does not . It seems that the author thinks he needs to have lots of fairly poorly written sexual scenes to maintain the interest of the reader . Not true . It seems like it could be a great story but the unceasing sexual trysts just make this a & # 34 ; slog through & # 34 ; kind of book . It is a shame as it seems like it could be good . I wo n't purchase another book in this series . One final thought , I do n't believe I 've ever read a book that spent as many words on the fashions worn by the characters . I do n't care about fashion so this was a real headache for me .	-1
All Niall Teasdale books include eroticism , but this book is without a story , just page after page of pornography . First two books had promise , but the author ran out of ideas and filled in with sex to sell another book. $ 2.99 is what I wish I could have back , Pornography on the internet is free	-1
This book aid have been worth my $ 3 had I not been so flipping confused ! This book truly needed an editor and before any other author charge this amount of money for a few pages please think twice ! I felt as if I missed an entire page on certain parts . Do n't appreciate the fact that I had to constantly read the same paragraphs written on a different page . This storyline would have received a five star rating if it was n't for this Tom-Foolary ! Editor people !	-1
The author had a great story line/idea but 80 % of the book was sex scenes . This book just needed more .	-1
this book has some excellent creative ideas but the poor plot development and grammar detract so much i wish i didnt buy it	-1
The story unfolded with an odd tempo . It was very slow to start then H inexplicably grew hot and cold towards the h. They were & # 34 ; caught & # 34 ; during one of his sudden hot times and needed to marry . The H then suddenly morphed into a critical SOB . The story then suddenly resolved , giving the reader no hit as to why , when the H decided to be happy and proud of the h .	-1
I tried I really did , but the way sass was portrayed was beyond immature..I know she was young & all but with as much talent as she had I dunno it seemed to ( Young Adult ) for me ... teenager that has gotten around ..her dad basically raised her around a bunch of men all her life..sad part is one would think being raised by her father , she would be mega protected by her daddy..the stupid A-holes that always used her & dumped her..dad still had business with them..still employed the..sad in my opinion ... maybe for some this would be a 5 star rated book..but not mine..fell WAY short..	-1
Pretty good plot and good characters but terrible language . I actually would have enjoyed the story okay if the language had not been so bad but I had to skip over so much it was kind of hard to enjoy .	-1
I really like books with a lot of dialogue . This book was very descriptive but had a ton of spelling errors and run on sentences . Not a bad book but just not my type of writing .	-1
You just get into the story and it 's over . It was not worth The money I spent on it . l will never buy another book . I feel like I got ripped off .	-1
This is a good example of a book needing an editor to bring the story together , fill in gaps , and correct the numerous punctuation and spelling problems.Note to author : multiple uses of 'all ready ' instead of 'already ' . Also , you can substitute 'recalled ' or other words for 'remembered ' where you have short sentences with each having a character 'remember ' different things from his life . Was a bit irritating.Has the potential to be a good book if you can bring it all together .	-1
I am very picky when it comes to what I like to read . This was recommended by a friend who promised this was unlike anything else I 'd ever read and to step out of my boring comfort zone.It definitely was not and I will stick to my comfort zone next recommendation.I do not like writing negative reviews . It is very , very rare for me to not finish a book and this was coming close to being the first book in four years that I did not finish.I think what kind of bothered me is that it seems like a ripoff of one of my favorite TV shows . I wondered more than once if the author is a fan of the show and if so , if she was inspired by it and this is her way of honoring said show.I disliked all of the characters . Every single one of them . Well , okay . Layla had some redeeming qualities and was the only one that I did n't want to run over with my fictional truck . Repeatedly.Not only is this a very slow read to the point that I wanted to rip my hair out , but could have used another go around with an editor as I found many misspelled words , incorrect grammar , and plenty of punctuation errors.Definitely a read for an adult who does n't mind gratuitous language and graphic sex scenes { Note : I am over 21 and did read the warning and went by my friend 's standard that it was n't & # 34 ; that bad & # 34 ; . Apparently we do n't have the same standards } I do have to say that even though I did n't care for it and wo n't be continuing on to read the second book , I think every book should not be judged by its reviews , but read with an open mind , hence why I read it .	-1
I like my MC books gritty and the grittier the better . Unfortunately , Faith & # 8217 ; s Temptation is sorely lacking in the grit department . It & # 8217 ; s so gritless , that when Faith and Ryder start making out on the beach & # 8211 ; shortly after walking barefoot on said beach & # 8211 ; he proceeds to lick and suck on her toes as part of their foreplay before they have sex . As someone who grew up in the Florida Panhandle and has been on several of the beaches along the Gulf Coast in Florida , Alabama and Mississippi , I found that scene very difficult to believe because Gulf Coast beach sand sticks to everything , especially in between the toes.Sadly , this was not the only thing I found lacking in the book . The dialogue often felt stilted , especially between Ryder and Faith . Ryder & # 8217 ; s sister Layla is the queen of mixed messages & # 8211 ; she warns Ryder away from Faith , tells Faith that her brother is not a good man and she should avoid him , yet when Faith has a fashion emergency while getting ready for her first date with Ryder , Layla comes to the rescue with a halter-dress and heels . But most importantly , Ryder is not believable as the VP of an MC , especially as he tells Faith that he runs drugs and guns and has murdered people . He lacks the hardened edge that is typically associated with someone in his position ; the fact that he seems to have no qualms in telling Faith that he loves her , will take care of her , and wants to marry her is at total odds with the outlaw biker/trucker personality he is supposed to possess . An alpha male he is not and as much as I hate to admit it , I found myself snickering at several of the sex scenes when the author attempted to portray Ryder is sexually dominant.While I did enjoy Faith & # 8217 ; s character more than Ryder & # 8217 ; s , I found the speed at which her resolve to not date anyone crumble when Ryder pursued her for date surprising & # 8211 ; and by that I mean she agreed to a date after he asked her twice . However , she definitely redeemed herself when she confronted her ex-boyfriend Beau and her ex-best friend , Peggy Sue ; now THAT was a scene that made up for her waffling . I also found the ending of the book to be quite enjoyable & # 8211 ; and no , not because it was the end , but because of the situation Ryder finds himself in . It certainly sets the stage for the sequelI was so excited to read this book because I remember reading the sample on Amazon when it was originally released under the title , The Lost Trucker , and being disappointed that it was no longer available for purchase when I was ready to read it . Unfortunately , Faith & # 8217 ; s Temptation did not live up to its blurb & # 8217 ; s potential and it was just an okay read for me . I can only hope that the next book in the series is better and fulfills the promise of the cliffhanger.I received a complimentary copy of the book in exchange for an honest review.Reviewed by Angela at Crystal 's Many Reviewers !	-1
While I 'm a big fan of this author , this was upsetting . I basically just paid for the same book I already had . I was sure this was new ... .wrong , it 's just the first book all over again . So not fair that I just paid for that .	-1
The book is about Faith deciding to leave her hometown because of stuff that happened with her ex boyfriend . She now finds a new place to live , and has a new job . She 's finally taking care of herself . But things change when a trucker comes through who shows interest in her . He has a relation to an MC , and wants her as his but fears she wo n't accept the true him.I really do n't have a whole heck of a lot to say about this book . I just did n't like , and it was n't for me . I was n't a fan of the writing , and the dialogue between the characters just seemed forced , and cheesy . Not only that but I was n't a fan of any of the characters either . I could n't connect with anyone in the story . Then there was the fact that I felt there was n't any real emotion in the book . None of the characters had much depth to them , and I was really frustrated with the whole thing . So I wo n't be continuing this series .	-1
I started Toxic and this was a Did Not Finish for me . What I got to was that you have Shattered Souls ( Rook , Grey , Landon and Cruz ) and Twisted Perfection ( Kaid , Maisy and Willow ) Shattered Soul is a huge success and they are on tour right now and Rook the main singer of SS is a man whore that loves getting high and drinking jack . He has a lot of issues growing up and for him to cope he drinks and smokes to stay numb . Oh yeah and just screws about anything that walks . I get it , I really do . One time too many , he screws the band over and their opening act leaves leaving them to pay for the expenses . Here walks in TP . They have been trying to make it big , playing at small dives . SS sees them , loves them except Rook because he does n't want to admit he is digging Maisy , signs them on . Here is where it got lost for me . I get the whole sex drugs and rock and roll but for me unless it is done right ( and trust me there is a way ) cheating is a no no . You have Grey that loves Quinn ( stylist for both bands ) , they love each other but Willow from TP wants Grey and will stop at nothing to get him no matter that she likes Quinn . She thinks that Quinn is a sweet girl but Grey is hers and will take him from her.That was all she wrote . I was trying to give it a chance but for me Willow was acting like a trashy ho . I was done . That alone for me is what stopped it.Oh yeah , but Grey wants Willow too but is & # 8220 ; really & # 8221 ; trying to not let things happen even though he dry humps Willow on their tour bus and blows his load but & # 8220 ; he does n't want to hurt Quinn & # 8221 ; Give me a freaking break.Things might have turned around at some point because I know Landon ( Greys brother ) is in love with Quinn and has been forever and Quinn admits that she sees the looks that Willow and Grey give each other.I get that this is a story , its make believe but I want to be able to believe it and want to continue reading it.There was a lot of point of views going around that at times I was confused on who was talking and who they were talking too . If there was a break between chapters for me I think that would have been better.I liked the story line , who doesnt love a story about bands that tour together . I get the whole sexual tension and at times it was very hot but at the end of the day it just was n't for me . To much going on to stick with it.Reviewed by Beggin from Mommys a Book Whore	-1
This book is so wrong on so many levels : * the story is not well rounded and it includes POV from too many secondary characters* 2 of the main characters are heartless cheaters* the author seems to have a fascination for defecation , which is a recurring theme in the book . This was really disgusting.I ca n't go any further as I did n't even make to the halfway point of this garbage .	-1
Mostly because the language is so stilted it is distracting . In theory , the person from whose perspective the story is being told was born in the USA of immigrant parents . The books feels like it was written by a non-native English speaker . I found this so distracting I put the book aside because I was more interested in the syntax than the story and trying to figure out if the book was written by someone with a good grasp of the English language . I may go back to it .	-1
Feb 9 : NOTE the authors commented the term Little Aussie Gluten Flour will be removed by February 11 when their cookbook is updated . The external link to their proprietary pie crust recipe is included as a convenience , according to one of the authors . Below is the original review.I downloaded the Allergy Friendly Eats : A Collection of The Little Aussie Bakery & Cafe 's Most Popular Gluten-Free & Allergy Friendly Recipes cookbook by authors Rita Sturzbecher and John Apostolovic and was a bit disappointed to find the authors included external links to their website to get recipes . I do believe if I pay for a cookbook it should contain all the recipes needed to prepare a dish . I should not have to depend on Internet access to complete a recipe . Also , their cookbook lacks an interactive table of contents making it a bit more difficult to find the recipes you would like to prepare.Also , some of the recipes call for proprietary ingredients such as Little Aussie GF Flour.I do like how the authors stated all the recipes are gluten free and are free of the top 10 allergens unless otherwise noted . You will read an index of recipes and there are notations stating if there is a possible allergy ingredient used to prepare the recipe . You will find numerous color photos showing completed recipes.Some of the recipes you will find in their cookbook include : Spinach Quiche with the notation `` Contains dairy . '' This recipe uses Little Aussie GF Flour and includes an external link for the pie crust recipe needed to make the quiche.Mini Chorizo French Toast ( You will need to purchase the Little Aussie GF buns to complete the recipe ) .Creamy Rice PuddingAlmond Tea Cake ( Recipe says contains the notation `` Contains eggs and almonds . '' ( You will need to purchase the Little Aussie GF flour to complete the recipe ) .Dairy-Free Garlic `` Butter '' Australian Lamb Pie ( You will need to buy and pick up the pie crust from the Little Aussie Bakery or make the pie crust by finding their recipe online using an external link ) .Ox Blood Chocolate Cake with the notation `` Contains eggs . '' ( You will have to purchase the Little Aussie GF flour to complete the recipe . There is a link to the Little Aussie Bakery & Cafe to purchase the flour ) .As you can see this cookbook reads more like an advert than a true stand alone cookbook . You will need to use the enclosed cookbook links to find the extra recipes or ingredients you need to prepare the recipes.Note : I suffer from potentially life threatening allergies , so I am always on the lookout for good allergy recipes , and cookbooks . I wish their cookbook had been what I had hoped for.Recommend with caveats given.MR	-1
This book was over for me within the first 100 pages . If you are interested in Mayan history - ( not sure of the info for truth - but did n't care ) When I read I mostly read to relax and forget everything else for the time . This was names I could n't pronounce and about Maya society and history and everything too tedious for me to continue - so I did what i normally do n't do - I did n't finish it- life is too short to suffer thru a book that is like work .	-1
The book was boring . I wonder where the author got the historical data forr the book . I would not recommend this book to any of my friends .	-1
He looked at me , with his steel gray eyes.He smiled at me , with his steel gray eyes.He killed that guy who did n't have steel gray eyes.He did n't follow me , with his steel gray eyes.I have to find the guy with the steel gray eyes.I found the man with the steel gray eyes.Even thought I know his name now , I will still refer to his steel gray eyes.Can we please focus on any of his other attributes ? Oh that 's right , there was mention of his freakishly long fingers . Ooooh sexy .	-1
At the beginning of this book , I was paying attentionBy the time I got halfway through , I was totally out of it.just to get this straight , I do not hate Emmy . I just do n't like her either.I find it very annoying that every time she dies , then somehow , a solution comes along and saves her . I was literally yelling , '' FINALLY ! ! ! ! ! '' when she died in this book . No offense for those who like her.And then ( spoiler -- ) she came back.Seriously ? I mean , I understand that these characters are supposed to have a happy ending after every challenge and all that , but it just got old.And also , the amount of times Emmy dies is nothing compared to the amount of times Marcus and her breakup and then get back together again . MAKE UP YOUR MIND ! ! ! ! And then Marcus is acting like he does n't care about her until she starts showing interest in Alex , which is NOT cool . Its pretty obvious to me that Emmy to Marcus is is n't important until there 's a threat to him that someone else might like her . if the love each other spool much , why ca n't they just stay together ? I personally was not sad at all when Emmy died . However , when A means died , I was totally the opposite . I actually like the story of Rage and Ameana more than Emmy and Marcus . They do n't break up , act all distant , a and then get back together ( repeat about 15 times ) . They suit each other instead of having half a human and the 1st Guardian . Speaking of Emmy being half human , I also did n't like how much Emmy did n't know . I mean , there should be books or something that explain everything , because whenever there 's a new word , Emmy has to know what it means , because no one 's told her yet . Ca n't the just tell her the story all at once if there 's no book ? I understand that that 's the way the reader learns the story ( by them telling Emmy ) , but telling her all at once also solves the problem.I had not complaints for all the other characters . it was just Emmy and Marcus.All in all , I think this book was n't as good as expected .	-1
It could have been better . I wish it would have been longer . I wanted it to have more depth to it .	-1
Ok book . Not much romance in this story . The thing I found hard to believe was a ten-year-old girl had a business plan to make gourmet ice cream , and she already had several recipes on hand ? ? ? REALLY ? Hahaha . Glad this book was free .	-1
This is a continuation of the Defiant 's storyline with Ell still on the run from President Stockton . This conflict is still unresolved . Using a US president as a villian was odd , but sort of worked . Making the President stupid did not work at all .	-1
This book was hard to get into , mainly because it was extremely slow-paced , had slow character development and just did n't seem interesting enough to me . The reader learns early on who the perpetrator is and can not help but feel sorry for how the heroine 's life turned out , including the ill-timed marriage early in life to her husband . I will probably try to read this book again in the future but for the moment , I find Sleep Tight confusing at times and hard to follow . I really wish there was enough intrigue in the book to retain my interest .	-1
I always give a book 50 pages , if the author does n't grab me , I move on . I 've moved on from this one .	-1
I did not like this . It was ALL sexual . They were together for like a week total with all these weeks in between where they were not a couple . He was disgusting . He lasted over 2 months without having sex because he wanted her but the first time he sees her , he grabs the nearest skank and drags her into a closet so she can give him oral , right in front of the heroine and then gets caught having sex with that same woman by the heroine later that night . Let us not forget that after having sex with that skank , he then gets the heroine off by her grinding on him later that night , with no mention of him cleaning up , and they have sex the next morning , still no clean up ! GROSS ! ! ! I understand they are COMPLETELY different than me but if all he had to do was apologize to the heroine and they could be together , why would he not just do that ? Why would he rather hook up with a groupie after all this time thinking he was not good enough for Callie , then make up with the heroine THE SAME NIGHT ? I was very disappointed in this book and the editing was bad . There were a lot of misspelled words . Also , Donovan and Mara ? ? ? ? Really ? ? ? How in the world is she going to feel when she finds out he had a threesome with her brother and her brother 's girlfriend ? I mean , Mara will see Callie ALL the time and know that her hero had slept with her future sister-in-law ! That is just sad . None of the other heroines have to see their boyfriends ' one-night stands on a daily basis , but now the youngest and most innocent does ? ? Nasty !	-1

I pre-order just about anything from Jessica and typically love her work . The Forgotten Girl , however , was a big disappointment . First , there were *A LOT* of errors : typographical , grammatical and editorial ( such as things in the wrong place in the story and narrative inconsistencies ) . The grammatical errors were everywhere ( you 're and your , it 's and its , pluralizing by apostrophe ) , stuff you do n't typically find in Jessica 's novels . I know auto-correct and spell check are fallible - but it 's as if no one bothered to copy edit , at all , before upload . I 'd rather an author delay publication than release something so below par.All of the above is that much more frustrating because the story just was n't all that good . I felt like I was slogging through , waiting for the pieces to coalesce , only to have the story collapse under its own weight . Important narrative elements ( back story for events prior to trauma ( s ) , family relationships , etc ) were n't rendered in sufficient detail to scaffold the denouement . I felt kind of pissed that I 'd soldiered through for nothing.Like many films , this book has an intriguing concept that did n't live up to its promise . Psychological disorders can be fascinating when handled well , but they are also very complex . Among other things , you ca n't skimp on character development . I felt as if the protagonist was two-dimensional at best , and everyone else was a flimsy cardboard cutout . I 'd give this one a pass and check out Sorensen 's Nova series , or any of the Callie/Kayden/Misha/Ella books .	-1
Kindle Cash ( ha ha ) spent a good deal of space asking for good reviews of this book . Not cool . Once , maybe twice , but not every other page . There may have been a useful bit of information in there somewhere .	-1
I am very sorry to say that for me , this book was a total rip off . There are no big secrets really . Google ad tool ... Come on ! I guess that if someone is totally new to SEO and has no clue about google ad tool , this book may be helpful for them.I have nothing against short books and this one is written very well . I know that it takes effort to write and publish a book but $ 3.99 ? for 20 pages ? I was stupid enough to assume that it would contain some really good information and that I would learn something new . But unfortunately it didn't.What I am also curious about is the author 's real name . Kindle Cash ? if you want to learn something about SEO for kindle and have more success with kindle I recommend books by Stevie Scott ( only 2.99 $ for a book that has much more content and you can also learn how to become a better writer ) or Jonah Jones ' : Realistic Passive Income which the same price like this booklet by Mr. Kindle Cash and contains much more information that you can also apply to blogging and other on-line businesses ( about 150 pages ) . Both author that I have just mentioned use their real names and have lots of free content on their blogs/ also SEO related/-But if you have no idea what google ad tool is , then maybe this book can help . Still , it was a bit superficial , not everything about google ad tool was explained.And yes , I am dying to know the author 's real name . He , or she , even uses keywords as their pen name.Think what is going to happen to this marketplace in a year or two . It will be flooded with title that look the same and authors/ pen names that also do look the same .	-1
I thought this was a thriller novel , it started out with a bit of a mystery , but quickly went into a trashy novel about some woman 's perverted dreams ( day and night ) that left no imagination as to what they were doing in bed . Very explicit sexual content . I would never read anything by this author again .	-1
Throughout the book I kept waiting for it to get interesting ... it never did . I will not bother with the rest of the books in this series .	-1
I really , really wanted to like this book but it just all fell apart for me . The & # 34 ; heroine & # 34 ; is just too stupid to live . At first you get to feel for her a bit because she watched her older sister sacrifice herself at the hands of a homicidal rogue werewolf . However , during the fight I started to get the inkling that it was the wrong sister who was destined to survive.Spoliers ... ... ... ... ... ... ..She barely manages to escape , and when she does her life is forever changed- she 's supposed to become this bad a $ $ super Exterminator who went through vigorous training ( which the Hero describes to be tougher than any SEAL training we may have- and you basically have to be an uber humman/vamp/were to complete ) . Only , on her very first time on patrol when she does encounter the big bad wolf , she charges directly at him , screaming like a banshee . What ? ! She ends up needing to be rescued by the Hero , despite her vehemnet denial otherwise.Once said H has rescued her , they ca n't seam to fight their attraction , engage in a lil nooky and then she stabs him b/c apparently that 's how you get someone to realize that you 're a big girl now and you do n't need nobody 's help.Then , fleeing the H she gets captured again ! Lucky for her , she is taken hold of by the dumbest idiots out there . Her one line to the dastardly devil reads , & # 34 ; Go away , you bully . Frightening a child . You should be ashamed of yourself ... Shoo ! & # 34 ; Shoo ! ! ! Really ? Really ? ! ? All her traning just went straight out the window . How the heck did she manage to scale mountains and swim across shark infested waters and wrestle crocs ? The writing comes across as being both disjointed and childish- with full stops to describe what someone 's wearing . I do n't need a break in the story for you to tell me a Guy A is wearing a cloak and Guy B is wearing a shirt with several buttons undone . Not if it does n't add to the context ! By the end , I was rooting for the evil rogues to finish her off .	-1
I assure I am not easily offended or `` faint of heart '' when it comes to reading material classified as erotica , taboo and even a little `` kink '' . However , this story did n't ride that gray line of dubious consent but rather was a story depicting straight up `` rape '' and a few lines in there re her body 's natural responses to sexual stimulus implies consent is untenable . In this instance , I neither found this story fun , hot or any of the other platitudes used by the other reviewers . This man 's wrongful disdained of this young woman was just an excuse to do to her what he had obviously always wanted to do . His daughter was the whore , not this young woman . How dare he . Frankly , I would have taken more pleasure in seeing him strung up by his balls than in reading this story . Moreover , his blatant attempt to ruin this young woman 's future with an unwanted pregnancy was despicable . Sorry guys , this connoisseur of `` soft Porn '' has to vote a big thumbs down on this one !	-1
This book had great potential with the premise , but fell very short . I thought it was poorly written , and the characters were not smart at all , using no common sense . It picked up a little towards the end but by that time , it was too late . Very disappointed .	-1
The book is about a thirteen year old skinny child who is pursued by her mother Katheryn . She sends her husband Wyatt to abduct the girl , who is known as a special child , a foster child . She is called Alice by others , but is given the name Eden by her mother . She does not remember her past well , but the story goes on to explain , that she had been isolated in a strange orphanage in Colorado with other children . These children have the ability to affect the world in the paranormal sense.The children were given some substance to make them forget their past ; it was a poison obtained by a rare species of worm as the book explains . With the help of a man called Apostle Zeke the child is located . Wyatt uses a stolen vehicle to abduct the girl and carefully escapes undetected . The mother is portrayed as a deeply religious woman who , & # 34 ; thanks Jesus & # 34 ; that her child is returned safely , and emphasizes that she is a special child . There is a strong reference of God in the book.Ted Dekker uses this book as an introduction to entice you to read the complete set of four . I found the book short and easy to read in one day , it is possible that the books could be combined as one book , but be more profitable as four . Dekker delves deeply into the spiritual realm but leaning more into the occult . As a Christian , I did not like the representation of God and of Jesus , being used by people who did not act like Christians . The story had parts that sounded unrealistic and unbelievable , and it did not entice me to read the rest of the books . One last note , the cover does not depict a skinny thirteen year old but a beautiful young woman walking on water . It appears to me like another contradiction with the book .	-1
I rarely watch TV for fun . I read thrillers , 2 or 3 a week . I have a great tolerance for mediocrity , but I gave up on this one in 5 chapters . The plot moves like a glacier in January , endless details bogging the story down . If it was a TV show , I 'd be yelling at it , `` Enough , get back to the story . `` If you can endure , for example , five pages describing a PT qualification that could have been done in one page or less , the book might be okay for you . Judging by other reviews , I guess many can . For me , this kind of tedium turns a thriller into a yawner .	-1
You could tell that his was a novice writer.The book was free that was the only redeeming thing . I could not read the entire book i leafed through the pages	-1
This book took me awhile to get through . Juliette ( Jette ) was on my everlasting nerves . I still do n't know what Evan saw in her ... Evan was this second string NFL celebrity quarterback that falls for a bartender crazy chick ( Jette ) . The story is so predictable and the heroine is so annoying that you have to keep putting the book down . They had the nerve to have a book 2 with the same characters ! I 'm not reading it .	-1
Too sticky sweet for me . And I did n't like the way the shifters were portrayed . At all . Weak , human-like , vulnerable . I like my shifters kickass , badass , sexy , and kings of all they survey . I know Hollis Shiloh has a solid fan base and I admire that , but these wolves are just not my cup of tea .	-1
I liked the description of the story but the reality was less than expected . The plot was too sweet and too stupid at the same time . The separation was as unbelievable as anything I 've read and the reunion anticlimactic . There are better stories of the same theme in the library .	-1
I 'm sure the characters in this book are likable and engaging , but I could not get beyond the desperately bad writing . The most egregious example is & # 34 ; She dabbed a tissue at her eyes that she had pulled from her cleavage. & # 34 ; I just ca n't imagine how that sentence made it through the process . There is potential in this author , but there needs to be some serious editorial guidance and maybe a few writing workshops before I 'd be willing to delve back in . I rarely write bad reviews , but this was too painful to let it slide .	-1
I thought I would be safe reading a & # 34 ; cozy & # 34 ; mystery with elderly ladies as the investigators . Nope ! Why do authors have to add cuss words ? Come on ! ! Surely there are other words you can use . They were n't even necessary ! ! !	-1
I read lots of self-published books by beginning authors , and I do take into account their sometimes less-than-professional writing . However , this author has 14 books under her belt and this one reads like a beginning writer 's class assignment.The dialogue is so poor , with not a breath of believability , the characters have no character and scenarios are improbable , to say the least . Usually , readers have internal imagery that swirls around in the brain as they read . In this case , the only images I see are middle school drama class actors mumbling bad dialogue as they clomp around a stage.I do n't need a story to be Pulitzer material to be enjoyable , but this is undeniably one of the poorest novels I 've encountered .	-1
This book started out ok but then it just boring . It is so long because it has several books all together and after the first book all the others were boring to me .	-1
I bought this book on the basis that it had Slow Burn in it , which I had read and mostly enjoyed . However , that was it for me in this one ... .I only skimmed and skipped through all of the others . I kept moving on to the next story in the hopes that it would get better , but it did n't . I think this might be the least expensive way to get Slow Burn if you do n't have it yet ; but since I already had it , I 'm just returning it for credit now . I did n't even want to spend .99 on it when I skip read over to the end .	-1
Honestly , it was so lame I could n't even finish it . Which is disappointing , because I have read a lot of Ms Pressey 's books and enjoyed them . The main character in this book is just stupid . She is 200 or so years old but she acts like she 's about 12 . The writing is completely disjointed and extremely annoying to read . Normally when I ca n't finish a book or do n't like it I do n't write a review , but this one has actually made me angry that I spent money on it . So , please , save your money and give this one a miss . Sorry Ms Pressey , but I actually think you should be embarrassed about charging for this terrible book .	-1
Let me start by saying you can see the number of stars and I ca n't even say for sure that I would n't rate this a 1 1/2 stares instead of 2 , so know going into this review that it 's not hearts , rainbows , horses , and blue moons.I really struggled to finish this book , the story was good but the characters and I mean everyone outside of the MC well let me take that back Talon 's son and Zara 's daughter did n't bother me but everyone else got on my last nerve . They were all very immature ( I could n't believe they were n't teens ) . And I do n't mind silly or carefree but my gosh you are all adults correct . One minute the heroine Zara had no control and acted like a child the next she was scolding everyone for cussing . Zara 's best friend was even worse she would fight and argue with Zara 's daughter like they were sisters , and Zara 's Brother and his partner were just as bad ( I do n't know but I do n't want to hear about anything that turns my brother on and vice versa ) If I heard one more weird nickname for Zara I thought I was going to die.And then **SPOILERS** the whole other woman situation was just stupid all around and when I say stupid I mean stupid , Talon owns strip clubs and Zara see 's him making out with a woman and she justifiably gets mad ( and can we stop here why did Talon let all these woman paw all over him after he has Zara then laughs or smiles when she got mad ) , then we find out that it 's NO BIG DEAL because they are friends and they always kiss after their strip club meetings but thats all that happens oh and its ok because she 's a lesbian ... ... .say what **END SPOILERS**I do n't know why this book rubbed me the wrong way in so many ways but it did , the premises was great and I really though I would have enjoyed this book , I love MC books . But this one was a fail for me . Had the author taken this a different route and it actually felt like we were dealing with adults this book would have been great but , it . Just . Was n't . The bare bones of this book is actually really good but all of the filler and stuffing was just bad .	-1
Some of Rob Parnell 's books are helpful , but this one did not really offer much this time . There was too much about him and his life , not practical knowledge .	-1
Well the start was a little confusing as to its relevance but as it continued , my interest was peaked . However , the story seemed to get lost and veer in several directions leaving me stranded as to the plot and without any connections to any of the characters , which non of which were likable . Not even the main female , Lindsay . Frankly , the way the escort themed club is conducted , leaves me cold . Not a recommended read from me .	-1
Seriously ? ? What 's with all the stars ? Sorry , but this was the WORST book I have ever read . I appreciate an author putting work out- but this was ridiculous . Lots of mistakes and the worlds stupidest plot . It was a great idea , but the writing was so terrible- Thank goodness it was free !	-1
I should know better by now . What a god-awful mess . The heroine is pathetic in so many ways I ca n't be bothered to innumerate them . The men are worst . The sex is incredibly predictable . The dialogue is stilted , and there are too many sentences where the word order turns them into nonsense . The best I can say is that someone did run spellcheck .	-1
I dislike books that open with an ending then jumps to a beginning then jumps to a past experience and all the while seeming to have no point . It 's not even romantic in any sense that I can see , I made it to the fourth chapter and put it down for good .	-1
I downloaded this book because it sounded interesting . It has a good beginning , then deteriorated into a romance . The main character supposedly writes articles for a horticulture magazine , wears designer suits and lives in New York City . The author has obviously never written magazine articles or she 'd know how little one gets paid , and she sure as HELL has never lived in New York . It 's expensive , very , very expensive . Okay , I could get past that . Then he hires Alaska ( Allie ) Wilde to guide him ... in the afternoon . They leave at 0500 the next morning . Exactly when did she get supplies , get the horses ready , etc ? I gave up at the 40 percent mark when ... .SPOILER ALERT ! After the two of them had traveled for a day , spent the night and traveled ( with only two horses - where were all the supplies ? ) when Allie 's ex-husband flew over head in a ultra light . Now ... .how on EARTH did he know where they were ? That was just the straw - there was a lot of silly romantic banter between the two on the trail . Seriously ? I thought this was a horror or Sci Fi novel . Nope , it 's romance .	-1
Totally boring , nothing exciting happened , no laugh out loud moments . I felt no emotion while I read it . Read at your own risk	-1
it was an ok book -- -- -i appreciate it had no offensive sex or language . to be honest I probably wo n't read the next book as the story was not that compelling .	-1
IT IS DEFINITELY NOT CLOSE TO 50 SHADES AT ALL ! The sex scenes were great but the Liz was SOO immature , insecure , whiny and I wanted to slap her . She completely got on my nerves . I do n't know ANYONE that would behave like that and she was supposed to be well educated and ready to enter the real world ? It was like she was just out of high school . Totally not believable . PLUS , Sacha was a complete ass most of the time .	-1
The blurb promised to make me forget about 50 shades , but it certainly did n't do it . Sacha is a jerk , who treats Lisa badly , hot then cold . He even decides he does n't like her name so calls her Liz . And Lisa/Liz keeps going back for more . Perhaps this is a good illustration of how women get caught up in bad relationships . But , as a romance it fails .	-1
After enjoying the first three volumes for free I wanted to finish the story . I paid for this and am sorry I did . The story was getting interesting and just ended .	-1
Another shifter romance skirting too close to too many taboos because of a mediocre storyline and an idiot for a heroine .	-1
A convoluted story line with weird digressions and week characters . I would not recommend this for any fans of shapeshifter romances .	-1
This book started out really well and truly had some good characters and was written well . However , the story just went downhill . Maybe the author was on deadline to meet .	-1
Sort of predictable with too much over thinking on a love affair between these two roommates . Not enough interaction with outside sources .	-1
Ok , reread I do n't really mind reading how the boys felt but It 's not what I 'm after . I have followed this series but to be honest I 'm getting bored . I really hate love triangles and this is one big depressing loop with a girl who ca n't make up her mind and two guys going psychotic for her attention . Lame and boring and I 'm not interested in how it ends . The back and forth of this series has taken its toll and over it !	-1
Mea culpa . At social media sites , before I read this book , I said I 'd bought it . That may have led people to believe it might be a good , amusing book . In my opinion , it 's neither.Oh , I love Brian Johnson 's humor , online . I thought I 'd love this book , as well.Then , I read it and I do n't . However , to be fair : I 'm a writer and the word & # 34 ; writing & # 34 ; does n't appear anywhere on the book cover . My expectations may have been too high.This book does share some good tips about publishing . I 'd read most of them in others ' reports and courses , but Brian distilled them down to their basic ( perhaps lowest ) common denominators . Those can be useful if you 're a busy author and just need some pointers.However , the rest of this book ... ? No . Too many run-on sentences made this book difficult to read . ( I actually counted the words in one sentence , and it was 46 words long . Really . ) Other sections were simply confusing . I had to re-read them multiple times to figure them out . Even then , I was n't always sure what Mr. Johnson was trying to say.So , I was n't happy with this book by the 20 % point . I did n't like the bold-typed first letter in each paragraph , either . It seemed like very odd formatting.Then there was Mr. Johnson 's heavy emphasis on keywords . His advice might sell niche research software , but I do n't think it 's the smartest way to predict book success . When you 're planning to write a book , by-the-numbers approaches wo n't give you the entire story . ( No pun intended . ) My shoulders really sagged in disappointment when I reached the section where he recommended outsourcing book content . I wo n't say it 's a complete blight on the indie publishing field , but it 's close.Hiring someone who writes articles for $ 3 - $ 15 , to author your book for you ... ? Bad advice . ( Yes , I once worked for an article-writing service . Among professionals , that kind of writing is called & # 34 ; junk on paper. & # 34 ; Those $ 15 articles were n't our best efforts , and we only wrote them to pay the rent . Pride in our work ... ? No . We were grateful our names were n't on the finished products . ) Then again , outsourcing may explain things like the 46-word sentence in this book.All in all , I think this kind of book misleads nice , trusting people with dreams of being published someday . It sells them on a business model that 's more about making money than developing career skills as a writer/publisher.If you 're a veteran author who can sort the wheat from chaff to glean a few tips , you may find this book worthwhile at the 99-cent price.Otherwise , I ca n't recommend this book .	-1
Story was ok.I it was also roughly written . At times I could n't wait til it got to the point . It could have been better .	-1
I was given this book free from storycartel.com for my honest review.I tried to find interest in this book , but my mind kept wandering . There are several plot lines . The text is set out so that , on my epub pages , the sentences are divided part-way with a space and then the rest of the sentence reads like a second line . Also , there are several words that have a space where there should not be one . g et for example.I may try to read this again at some point , but for now I have no interest .	-1
This book only just scratches the surface of what is a complex topic . The information provided is sound but very basic and is nowhere near thorough enough to truly help a person afflicted with aquaphobia . I work as a swimming teacher and was hoping this might be a helpful resource but soon realised it is n't . The author has used all the right marketing strategies but has n't concentrated enough on actual content . There are many other books on the topic that are much more comprehensive .	-1
Just another fast paced , under-developed IR novella . Keep moving to the next book . Nothing to see here . Save your $ 5 , as I wish I had . Does n't even get an I depth review ( as is my custom ) because I could n't finish it ...	-1
I have not bought a book from Amazon that I did not like before but this is a conglomeration of someone 's mind that is going mad . I skipped pages and pages and it was as if I went to the next sentence . It did not make any sense . I could not finish this book as I was bored to tears by page 20.The first book in the epic fantasy was OK , it rambled a lot but I took a chance and bought book 2 I really wish that I hadn't..I have read the 2 comments that people have made regarding my review and although justified in their own minds this a personal review from me . First let me say that if you read my review I did not say that I only read UNTIL page 20 but that I was bored by page 20 , I read almost half of the book before I gave up.Your opinion is just as relevant as mine and I would not make the kind of comments that you did even if I did not agree with you .	-1
I want money back . Not even worth my time to read . As a matter of fact , I want my time and my money back . Since Amazon changed their refund policies , the quality of writing has gotten progressively bad .	-1
This book , like all the rest in the series , is way too long and riddled with plot holes.The time-line is beyond FUBAR.Star fighters - What 's the point ? The small fighters ca n't damage a larger ship with its point defense systems . It 's a waste of resources . Stop building small fighters and build more Devastator 3 missiles.Speaking of the Devastator 3 , why build anything but those ? Yes , I understand the authors explanation behind the difficulty in building them . Stop building stupid smaller ships and there would be plenty of resources for D-3's.If the only ships able to stand up to an AI ship is the strikecruiser , why would you waste resources building anything else ? It 's like playing Command & Conquer . You do n't waste resources building 50 regular tanks when you can build 10 Mammoth tanks that will do the job better.A race if bear-like creatures from the planet Careth ? Does that make them Care Bears ? In one book they captured an AI ship intact . Why were n't they able to gather any usable technology ? The author only mentions they did n't find any AI 's in board . Where did they go ? Too many characters that have nothing to do with the plot that the author keeps coming back to randomly . Nobody really cares.Constantly mentioning the length and width of every single ship is getting super old ! We get it already ! How about mentioning the number of decks or turbo lifts or some other useless bit of information.Where the hell are the rest of Earths & # 34 ; allies & # 34 ; in all this ? They are mentioned but never described or brought into the fight.If an enemy ship were about to ram mine in a last ditch effort to take me out , I 'd have a quick micro jump plotted before each engagement to get the hell out of the way . It works when Strong wants to sneak up and attack someone . Why not to avoid getting killed ? Finally , if Katie was able to store both of the friendly AI 's on some sort of crystal why is she not able to copy them and put them on all the ships in the fleet ?	-1
The story idea was a good one , and well executed , until about half way through , when it became graphic porn . The minute detail in which all was described really detracted from the story .	-1
I did not buy this , the ONLY reason I am leaving a comment is to help stop sales of this religious crap.This low-life `` author '' is obviously deliberately trying to fool people into thinking he 's THE Stephen King to push his religion.So I add my low-rating just because of the fact that I HATE deceptive people ... ... especially when they are trying to promote their religious agenda through fraud .	-1
Only got to chapter 18 I think . This book could not keep my focus at all . The story line seemed haphazardly put together . Sorry but this needs a lot o work .	-1
I like a romance novel with a touch of reality , things happen way too fast in this book . I could not connect with the characters . Which woman allow a billionaire to toy with them then end up broke after losing her job ?	-1
I found this story long and not in a good way . I liked the characters and the story idea , but I did n't feel any real attraction between the characters . I understand that the possibility of this family growing on you , but I would never deliberately seek them out . Sorry but I just do n't get it .	-1
Kaiya is having a tough time . She 's been physically abused and the center of her world at the minute is her brother , Kamden , and her job . When she decides to join the same gym as her brother , she meets Riker - the hot , muscly manwhore who wants to flex her glutes and pull her hamstrings ( I 'm stabbing blindly in the dark with these gym terms because I 'm as familiar with gyms as I am with social cues ) .As the story goes on , we get more details on Kaiya 's abuse by Kaleb . At first we 're left in the dark about who Kaleb is but with a brother named Kamden and her own name , it does n't take Stephen Hawking to see that there are some Kardashian-esque naming practices going on here and siblings with names beginning with K is officially a thing . Kaiya has been let down and abused by so many people - by her physical abuser , by her parents who have torn loyalties - that she deserves someone trustworthy and kind . And that 's where Ryker comes in . A man as stupid as his name , he 's the type of person who you wonder how he got this far in life without chewing off his own foot . He pervs on the young female gym clientele , he judges his overweight clients and has clearly lost his respect for others down the back of some slut 's sofa . Oh , you did n't like that I called a woman a slut as a pejorative ? Get used to it because that 's how Ryker sees the women he sleeps with - they 're sluts , whores , b ! tches . These words are tossed out so casually , but I got the feeling I was n't supposed to be as shocked and grossed-out as I was . Ryker got a boo-boo on his feelings a few years ago ( a whorish , slutty , b ! tch-c*nt was responsible , of course ) so now he uses women for sex and nothing more . This also means that he hates all women . Every one of them . So when he sees Kaiya , he 's shocked by how pure and unwhorish she is . Joy ! But it is n't that easy to entrap the princely prize that Ryker is . Even during their 'courtship ' , Ryker bangs his way around town , dodging whiny women who expect respect and basic courtesy . Stupid sluts - do n't they realise a woman hurt his feelings a few years ago ? As their 'romance ' unfolds , Kaiya has to deal with the prospect of her abuser being released , Kamden 's over protectiveness and her friend with benefits , Bryce . Here 's where Kaiya lost me . She and Ryker truly are soulmates because they see nothing wrong with treating people like crap . It 's clear that Bryce has feelings for Kaiya ( and it 's impossible to believe she does n't realise this ) but she continues to sleep with him whenever the mood strikes . Bryce is clearly a good guy . He worries about her and wants her to be safe , but Kaiya treats him like an irritant , despite having hauled her butt out of his bed only a few days prior . Who is raising these characters ? Does no one listen to Aretha Franklin anymore ? Having said that , it 's an entertaining book - I 'm just particularly sensitive when it comes to manners and people being mean . There are a few really worthy and valuable features in this book , however . Kaiya takes a lot of self-defence classes and they 're described in such a way that the reader can conceivably pick up a lot of tips . This never comes across as preachy or lecturing , rather it brings the reader deeper into the story - verifying Ryker 's ostensible 'good guyness ' . Along with that , there is a page on sexual assault resources and information at the back of the book . I ca n't stress how welcome this was . The author took a responsible , mature and sensitive approach to the book 's subject matter , so while I may not have been captivated by the characters , the author won a fan in me for this .	-1
Let 's be honest . Most likely you will NOT get rich reading this pamphlet . You get a free gift fir reading this book but after reading what I read here I 'll pass . Waste of time . 2 stars	-1
I would have given this book 3 or 4 stars but it has two major flaws . First , the major conflict between the protagonists is a plot twist I saw coming from the early stages of the story so the final reveal falls flat . Second , nothing is resolved in this segment of the story . After what is supposed to be the big revelation , the book ends abruptly leaving the reader to wait until the next installment and hope for a resolution at that point . That being said , this is a story about the healing love between friends and the powerful love between siblings . The lengths that one man is willing to go to in order to protect his sister is definitely makes for a poignant read .	-1
How do you write a prequel to a series that does n't exist ? A prequel is written LATER , though it takes place before the existing series . That 's what makes it a prequel ! This author has published NOTHING BESIDES the & # 34 ; prequel & # 34 ; ! There IS no HEGEMON WARS series !	-1
Amazon please put a description in the listing that the book is a freaking cliff hanger . For $ 3 I thought I was getting a book . A short one . But still a COMPLETE book . Story was weak characters poorly developed .	-1
Just not my thing I guess . Figured it would be humorous since its a Romantic Comedy . It was n't . Enough said .	-1
The book had 2235 locations on my kindle . The book was about an eighteen year old girl , named Jocelyn and a very dominant man named Andrew . Jocelyn had just lost her father , when Andrew , an old family friend reentered her life . She had no money , no one to take care of her , therefore Andrew stepped into be her guardian . Andrew immediately decided , he wanted to be more than just Jocelyn 's caregiver , he wanted to be her husband . He had a few conversations , with his good friend Charles about Child Brides and decided , Jocelyn , whom , he would call Josie , would be his Child Bride . Josie decided , she loved her Papa and would do anything to please him . Josie was forced to wear little girl dresses , receive enemas and many spankings with multiple instruments.I did not like all the interaction between the nanny and Josie . The nanny did everything for the young girl and I do mean everything . I did not like the harsh public spankings , witnessed by the servants and whom ever else , entered the room . I did not feel , that Andrew truly loved Josie , he treated her like his own personal , mindless sex slave . I have read many spanking books , age play erotica , I did not like this one .	-1
I did not like this book . The writer was basically pushing the water system that he worked with . It was n't a diet . He was just telling us to use a certain type of water .	-1
Also extremely boring . I could n't finish it and just did n't care . If you like infomercials read this book . It 's made for you .	-1
This book is nothing but a scam to have you download & # 34 ; the missing chapter & # 34 ; , which then takes you to a website where they hope to make a bunch of money off you . I am really disgusted by being scammed by a book I picked up on Amazon . Amazon should put a stop to this , pronto !	-1
I got this book because it seemed like it would be good . But I was very upset with what they call a book , just happy it was free . So do n't bother with reading it at all .	-1
Good short story ! But a too be continued in the middle of the story ... .. I gave it two stars because the author needs to know when to end a book ! ! ! !	-1
I agree with the previous review . This was just lame and I certainly will not be waiting to read the next installment . Everyone was just ignorant !	-1
I do a lot of gardening , including container and indoor gardening . I am always looking for more information as there are a lot of tips and tricks out there that I love learning . However , this book offers none of them.This is a very basic tutorial on growing fruits and vegetables , but you you can find this information on numerous websites with a simple search . I applaud the author for putting out a basic tutorial , however , this book is need of a lot more information.Basically the info you get is as follows : What size container per plantHow to sowHow much lightHow often to water ( though I will note this would be correct for outdoor container gardening , not indoor ) How much time to maturityHow to harvestWhat information should be included ? Differences in water needs , pest problems , and sunlight needs between outdoor container gardening and indoor container gardening . If you keep your pots indoors , you will deal with different pests than you would outdoors . Watering needs are different , if you grow you plants indoors , you need much less water , as it 's very easy to over water . There are many tricks to help with this , but none found in this book.There is no mention that your tomato plants will become leggy if they do n't get enough sunlight . There is also no mention of how to pollinate your tomato plants so that you actually get tomatoes , if your plants are grown indoors.There is no mention on what pH the individual plants need . The book talks about clumpy and well draining soil , but makes no mention of possibly using your own compost , or what type of soil to purchase , other than good quality soil . A beginner will not know what makes a good quality soil.There is also no mention if you can re-use the soil/container once your fruit/veg has been harvested , or if you need to amend it in any way.This is a good start , but is lacking a great deal of information . There is nothing here that you ca n't find on the internet , and there are absolutely no tips and tricks for those who lack a green thumb .	-1
I love the author 's work and I love to start a new series . This book kept me wanting to read more chapters than I wanted to in a day . .	-1
Here 's a tip- do n't take investing advice from someone who ca n't be bothered to attend to details like spelling , capitalization , and formatting.This book is one man 's deductions about Warren Buffet- it 's not based on any interviews with Buffet . It did n't have references to support its conclusions.I 'm giving it 2 stars because it might get better as you go along , but the first quarter of the book was enough to turn me off .	-1
Too bad these recipes are just copied from the Internet , and they are easy to find . Oops . Do n't buy this .	-1
The Fading Place was ` meh ' all around . The premises is intriguing though : Charlie , a single mother , steps into her car with her infant daughter . Problem ? A madwoman with a gun is already in the car , planning to kidnap Charlie 's daughter.What begins is the longest car drive Charlie 's ever had . Between worrying over her child and figuring out what to do with the woman holding a gun to her head , and trying to make it out alive , she has way too many issues to deal with all at once . Then the woman , Simone , starts telling her about her life , and the depths of her insanity soon become clear ... Unfortunately a good premise does n't always mean a good book . This novella was a bit disappointing , because we never got too invested in the characters . I wanted to feel for Charlie , worry about her little girl , even feel some connection to the antagonist , but I never really got to know any of them , so I was left feeling hardly anything . A book like this one could be terrifying - even the thought of being abducted is horrible . But it all falls flat , and there 's too little emotion . The book is too predictable - I predicted the ending right from the start - the portayal of Simone is n't convincing , Charlie 's panic does n't ring true.Despite not liking it that much , I did like the writing . Mary SanGiovanni has a fluent , prozaic writing style . If the characters had more depth , I would 've probably enjoyed this book more.I received a copy from this book in exchange for an honest review .	-1

That experience is what sold me on this one . Boy'o ... was that a mistake.This one was a hot mess . It lacked polish , it could have stood some literate editing and it had absolutely nothing original . It really resembled the shit you throw against the wall and watch as it started to slowly m o v e s down -- leaving a very messy and unappetizing trail . Just yuck ! I 'd say save your money , but know people will read the word motorcycle or see the term MC in the synopsis and be sold . Pity you . If you are n't more discriminating than that , you deserve this.Happy Reading !	-1
A quick scan of the preview was misleading . The story turned out to be a muddled and disjointed jumble of chapters , and seems like the product of a confused and disturbed mind . The chain of events is unclear and the scenarios are unlikely .	-1
I could n't get past the third chapter . this girl has a one night stand after her sister and fiance have sex , on her wedding day . She has a one night stand and thinks she 's a slut . really ! ! ! ? ? ! ! too stupid for words.and her mom is a stuck up birch who only cares about herself and her country club . I wasted 3 dollars .	-1
I thought this was a recipe BOOK ! ! Instead it 's more like a pamphlet . There are no more than a half dozen recipes , each with one or two variations . The recipes are very ordinary ( cobblers , cornbread , etc . ) that everyone should already have in their head . Really not worth downloading .	-1
Did n't use after getting the app .	-1
The first recipe contains two sales pitches ( links to items you can buy ) Later there is a link to an omelet pan , The recipes seem to be okay but nothing ground breaking and I just do not like the sales pitches .	-1
I really wanted to like this story . It sounded like it would be good . Two brothers build a resort in a small town and the local bartender , Sam , short for Samantha is against the whole idea . But she is attracted to one of the brothers so there are going to be problems.Now , do n't read any further if you do n't want to hear my thoughts . It was going okay until Sam , the heroine of the story , decides that she is going to have sex with the local sleaze , who stopped by for a booty call because she has n't `` been laid '' in a while . This guy had broke her heart several times but every time he comes to town for a booty call she caves and sleeps with him . Her friend has to threaten her to talk her out of it . So then she meets the brother and now she is attracted to him . It seems like she is attracted to anything in pants . Then she gets mad because she does n't believe the resort is good for `` her '' town . Now the bar is about to go under , the resort will bring in tourist with money , but she does n't want them in her town . Not only a local easy lay she is coming across a little bit stupid . I really did n't care for her character at all . I thought the brother was way too good for her . I quit reading . This heroine did n't do it for me . Other readers found it a 5 star read I just did n't .	-1
The stories are short and a few of them are romances , but too many of the stories are just about the sex , and not that interesting . I 'm sure there are women who will like the conflicted characters and unreal sex , but it 's just not my preference . I returned it .	-1
Sorry but it 's boring . If this is what gets you off then ... well I ca n't help you . But I 've had better on the Hallmark channel and that 's saying something .	-1
this book started out really good and with a different seniario than other books of its type and maintained that throughout until towards the end . At that point it seemed the author was in a hurry to finish the book and ended it suddenly	-1
Warning to readers : There is really nothing worthwhile here . The author has an interesting premise - a gamma ray burst , often thought by scientists to be the worst possible doomsday scenario ever - but then he completely screws up the story with illogical plot lines and horribly simplistic characters . He has no apparent knowledge of gamma ray bursts besides what he might have caught in an episode of & # 34 ; Through the Wormhole , & # 34 ; and even then , none of the actual facts around such an event made their way to the text of this mess.Two quick examples : The main character supposedly has his eyes seared by the gamma ray burst to the point of saying they were baking & # 34 ; like cooking meat. & # 34 ; Not a hour later , the character can see fine.Then there 's the American president , whose behavior is implausible to put it mildly . There are better villains in most Scooby Doo episodes . You 'll be going & # 34 ; Wait - what ? ! ? & # 34 ; at virtually every page turn.I was able to get about 25 % in before throwing up my hands in exasperation . There 's nothing here to waste your time on .	-1
I had problems with a number of aspects of this story ; the first of which caused me anger . U.S. Army Rangers would NOT find themselves in the situation as described . By the time they were threatened with the explosive leg device , they 'd have realized how seriously depraved the President had become and taken action to right it . And that 's only after suspending reality enough to believe that they would stand by while their friends , family , and fellow troops were condemned to death.Sailors do n't say `` Eye eye . '' The term is `` Aye aye . '' Et cetera .	-1
Usually a prequel lets me meet the writer and the characters and wets my appetite for more . Not this time ! While I like the character of Kate , even her father , I just did NOT like Daniel . Left me not caring to go forward with them .	-1
Shallow , prefunctory and assumes you have a lot of equipment you may or may not actually have . I ca n't recommend it .	-1
I really hate giving bad reviews but this was a mess . From unrealistic reactions to disastrous dialog switching . If I found out I was setup like Steph was for a movie , in would be pissed . Not whine about it . Then forgive the jackass ' lame apology . They actual crime parts were n't half bad . However that was overshadowed by a sniveling leading lady willing to forgive a jackass man because he was famous .	-1
This book 's grammar , spelling and typo mistakes were so bad that I quit halfway through . Nobody edited for mistakes . Also the voice changes so much , it 's hard to follow . One minute it 's written in third person , the next in first person . Finally , take time to write complete sentences	-1
Too short . You just start getting into the book I d it 's done . The story did n't have an ending and left you wondering why .	-1
I bought this thinking , maybe it would lead you into a book . But NO it just left you ! I will not buy anymore of her books . But I also will not buy anymore stories ... .thinking it will go into the book . So she has most likely wrong alot of other author 's that do . Because I will not trust them . It 's a shame ... because it had the making of a damn good MC book ! ; (	-1
I like the story but come on way to short and for the money I would of liked at least fifty more pages ... so it only gets two stars	-1
Jai a famous male model is being blackmailed . He complies with his blackmailers demands , because if the secret about his family member was to be made public it would destroy his family . So for ten long years Jai allows this couple to sexually abuse him , often allowing their friends to participate . The fact that the couple were his agent and his wife , people who were supposed to have his best interests at heart made the whole thing more horrific.Then he meets Summer , she 's like a breath of fresh air . Summer is not without her own drama . But these two hit it off . Summer tries to support Jai but he 's on a downward spiral . Eventually things come to a head , it 's make or break time.Unfortunately I did not enjoy this book at all . The scenes of Jai 's abuse were unpleasant and seemed there just for effect . The fact that Jai was allowing himself to be blackmailed to protect a close family member with whom he had never confronted or attempted to discuss wether the accusations were true I found totally incredulous and unbelievable . Especially as the abuse has been going on for a decade ! The plot had more holes than a string vest.His light and fluffy relationship with Summer felt all wrong and out of place in this . The baddies were ridiculously OTT . This is not sweet or romantic , in fact for those of you concerned by explicit content and graphic scenes including rape , you might want to avoid this .	-1
This was to much . I wanted to like it , but the MCs were extremely mean to each other . Example : Jonah twisting Kyle 's arm behind his back while shoving him into the door , while asking Kyle , `` Have I ever hurt you ? '' Well duh you are now . When Jonah 's partner drops him in the tub so that his head hit the faucet . With friends like that you do n't need enemies . The grammar seem good enough , all though I only made it through 59 % of the book . I received this book from the lending library .	-1
Could 've been more in depth truthfully . It Seemed rushed , the story line was nice but it 's missing so much that it 's hard to actually like the story	-1
I could not follow what should have been simple instructions . I guess maybe I 'll just stick with the stitches I know .	-1
I received an eARC copy of this book from the publisher via NetGalley . Here is my honest review . I 'm not sure why I did n't enjoy this book . The plot was interesting but I just never really connected with the characters.I would n't recommend this book - especially at the 3 dollars and change price point .	-1
I give anyone with get up and go to write a book kudos . The book ? not so much.I imagine this book would be great for my coffee buddy who , is compulsive , already organized could get some tops , but I 'm waaay over the top ...	-1
The main reason for that was because I wasn & # 8217 ; t expecting much , which was good because this book didn & # 8217 ; t deliver on any level . Even though this book contains nine stories , I was unable to find one that was worth reading for the price of the book . None of the stories flowed or seemed to be touched at all by the editor . However , this seems to be the recurring theme with this editor so in that regard there is a consistency , just not one that shouldn & # 8217 ; t be tolerated from author , publisher , or reader . As an author myself I rarely do this , but I will be getting a refund .	-1
I really wish there 'd been a few decent reviews of this book so that I could avoided the pain of reading it . I will say that the book is decently edited and so it is n't full of mistakes and the writing is n't bad . My issue is with the story itself . The H was married off to the h when he was 18 and she 14 . He then spent 4 years abroad and returns home with his mistress after his father dies and he becomes the Duke . He is in love with his mistress and she is a schemer , who intends getting him to marry her . The h is beautiful and is the toast of London . The mistress causes havoc in their relationship , whilst the H 's mother and sister try to save the main characters relationship.+++Spoilers+++I hate books with infidelity and this has continual infidelity as a theme . The H has a mistress and he continues on with her after he consummates his relationship with his wife . This is a dealbreaker for me and I hated the book because of this and because of the continual pettiness between the H and h. It was the ongoing fighting and misunderstanding that really got to me though . I want to read a romance for romance and not for betrayal and mistrust . More than 90 % of the book was about those things . I can not recommend this book .	-1
I LOVE Marie Halls Kingdom Series . I even wrote on the calendar when this will come out . The first half i was confused . He was suppose to be with Chrysalis but he was falling in love with Lissa . Then it started to make sense . And I loved it but at the end ... *SPOILER ALERT* ... Lissa and Chrysalis are the same so he has to fall in love with both personalities . It was really disappointed . I 'm hoping the next one will be better .	-1
Not even a short story . Not worth your time . Unbelievable `` plot '' . I wo n't be reading any more of this author 's `` books '' !	-1
SPOILER ALERT ! ! ! There 's this redhead who wears a green dress to a ball where she is noticed by an earl and they share a kiss or two and then they get married . The EndEpilogue : All of a sudden her father has died , her mother has remarried and had a baby , and the girl really loves him and his friend from Eton and guess who stars in the next novel ? And the story is just that abrupt . It 's a promo for Coming Attractions , the ideal time to visit the snack bar and find your seat .	-1
In the first 50 pages , I learned nothing new of Director Zero ( well , almost nothing ) . Bored to tears , I set the book down.Edit : I came back to look at recent reviews and see that there are other people who found the book less than worthwhile ( and of course negative points awarded by the author 's fanboys/girls ) . I am out of this series . The book is a definite `` life is too short to read mediocre sf novels '' .	-1
85 percent of book 1 repeated all of what we have already read . Made no sense . Hopefully 2 will get to it without repeating all the other stuff .	-1
This was waste of money and time . Just a recap of Loyalty and Respect . I hope Mina s story gets better .	-1
I REALLY DID N'T LIKE THE ENDING ARE TOO MUCH OF PART THREE OK WOULD HAVE LEFT G AND Diamond SHOULD HAVE KNOWN WAY MORE ABOUT G AND MO SO CALLED FRIENDSHIP SINCE MO WANTED G SO BAD JUST WAS N'T WORTH IT TWO WAS BETTER He missed out on alot when it came to the baby he wanted You should have let Diamond expose MO to MO 's baby daddy let her hurt hell she seen her sitting on his lap duh	-1
So Meadow was with her dad when he was gunned down by rival MC member and long time friend ? , Axel . Her dad gives her a mysterious USB with instructions to run away and get it to & # 34 ; Raide & # 34 ; in Los Angeles . She runs , he chases and we fast forward 16 months when he finally catches up to her . Sounds pretty interesting right ? It would be , if it were n't bogged down in absolute ridiculousness.How this book got so many high ratings , I have n't a clue , but they led me to want to give this story a try . I am not sure where to begin with the problems I had with this story . First off was the author is obviously not American and her use of European slang was n't working in a California MC story . We 'd not say & # 34 ; knickers & # 34 ; in California . Second , Axel kills her father in front of her and then hunts her for over a year . A couple days after being captured and shackled in his room she is fondling him in his sleep ? The dialogue was stunted and unrealistic . Some of it down right funny . An actual quote , & # 34 ; my dad did n't deserve to die , but I guess that 's just how it goes sometimes. & # 34 ; Seriously ? ! WTF ? I generously gave it two stars because some of the sex scenes were ok , but that does n't carry a book ! Avoid this at all costs . Way better MC books out there to be wasting time on this one .	-1
I love this author but this book lost my interest in the middle . I finished it and look forward to the next and last book in this series .	-1
I read other stories of Ella James and enjoyed it very much . However I forced myself to finish this story.I found it soooooo unbelievable.I mean who in their right mind will decide to have a drug addict and pimp as a sex buddy . Especially if you saw how he is when on drugs and he tell you himself he just came out of rehab.Is this not the kind of person you stay away from and decide not to have as a sex partner . Especially if he own his own brothel.She knew all this before she jumped into bed with him.Who in the world will do that.I felt no attachment to the characters . This book did not do it for me . It was rushed at the end . It was a simple plot that was not explored enough and the emotions was just not there in this book.I will not spend a cent on this book .	-1
This is really a good book . Story line and all , but I do n't really care for how the story is cut off . Granted there hopefully be a second book and all . But I did n't like the cutoff .	-1
This was not thought out well at all . Too many gaps in the story and then trying to fix it in . Glad it was free .	-1
Painful to read , as the so-called author clearly did n't bother to proofread after producing this verbal vomit . The only good thing about this short story ? I did n't pay for it .	-1
I loved the first book ; it was unique and different . I think most people who loved it too will be able to enjoy this one . And I appreciate the author wrote a sequel . Unfortunately , this kind of dissolved into a hot mess for me , and I finally gave up after the bizarre screaming match in which two grown men reverted to high school teenage girls . I officially stopped at 60 % , and then skimmed all the way to the ending . None of the new side characters interested me , and I missed the magic of the first book . This became a generic MM shifter book . A little sad , but likely this is just my problem , and I 'm sure you will enjoy this book more .	-1
This was the most pathetic excuse of a story I have ever read . No organization , no hope as to what was to be next . One minute this character we was in the future the in the past . This story bounces back and forth . Then it leaves you hanging to force you to buy the next book . I wo n't bother .	-1
This book is all telling , no showing . In fact there is basically no dialogue at all . It just rambles forever about anything and everything in the heroines past present and future . Yeah , I was confused too .	-1
Ok so the story was fine , but very predictable . New girl in town meets hot billionaire , they lust after each other until it comes to its natural conclusion . The sex was ok , the flash-backs were ok , but would have been better served to have been a chapter or two in the beginning to build a plot.The editing , such as mis-used and miss-spelled words , was horrible . Not sure if this was self published or not , but if it was , the author could have gotten someone else to proof-read it first and if a publisher put it out , I think they need to run it back through editing .	-1
This book did n't really hit my style . IT was okay , and do n't get me wrong some people might enjoy it , but it just did n't hit my fancy . I got all the way through the book and still could n't really get sucked into the story enough for me to enjoy it or the characters .	-1
Boring to the extreme . I thought the premise of the book was great - I love it when these British high and mighty lords find themselves wards of young children . Even though the duke was considered a runabout experienced rake , he did n't act like anything but an overly amorous 16 year old green as grass boy from the time he met the lovely governess , Miss Standhope . It defies all possible versions of reality to have him hiding in his library muttering to himself for hours on end after only a couple of days of being in the presence of this lovely lady . When Lady Southridge comes into the picture to try and control his life , things get even more muddled . Not even believable at all .	-1
This was just pages and pages of the same old thing . `` I 'm just a lowly governess . He ca n't marry me . '' `` I want her but she does n't want me . '' Over and over again . It was agonizing . And then ( spoiler alert ) , wonder of wonder her ship comes in and she 's suddenly rich and they can marry and be happy together . So formulaic ! I do n't even want to read the next book in the series . I usually finish books - good ones - in one night . It took me two weeks to force myself to keep reading to the end and even then I fast forwarded quite a few pages . Please do yourself a favor and skip this one .	-1
I did not enjoy or completely finish this book . The first several pages are a pity party that Symphony is constantly throwing for herself about not being loved . I always give about 50 pages before I am ready to throw in the towel . Well , that is a third of this book , and I still was n't interested . I had hoped Adam would make it worth the read , but he seems to tell her nice things and is a good person , but lets her continue to wallow . I skimmed the remaining two-thirds of the book , hoping I could talk myself back into reading the story . However , I am sorry to say , the last 20 pages did n't convince me I missed anything in the middle .	-1
It was one thing that the relationship was jumped into w/ little to no communication . That I can deal with ; great sex scenes , too . However , the whole & # 34 ; little girl & # 34 ; -toys-play in your room thing has to be the weirdest kink I 've ever read . And I 've read a lot of kinked-out books ! ! ! ! It just did n't seem & # 34 ; right & # 34 ; . I barely made it to the end . If those kinds of things freak you out , like they do me , then I 'd pass on this book .	-1
Possibly some spoilers , but really , you know what is going to happen once you read the synopsis , so nothing really revealed.Okay ... I approached this book knowing that there would be some elements I did n't like , judging by what else this author has written ... In the beginning , you have a heroine who is naive , makes stupid choices , and recognizes that about herself , and knows she needs to grow and make better choices in the future . So far , I liked it . Characters can be stupid at parts , that is fine by me ; it makes characters likable , sometimes . She runs , and I can see why she would , and then meets the heroes . All is fine . I liked that Daniel was angry at first , thinking she was a drunk driver , and I appreciated how that transpired . When the spanking thing gets introduced , I was a little unsure about it , but the author had hinted at it , and Danny and Trevor seem to give her time to acclimate to the idea , and once she shows interest , they proceed . Out of my comfort zone , but ultimately , not bad , though I skipped over the spanking scenes after a while . But while their love is certainly explained , and I can see why Emily falls in love , for crying out loud , can it be explained more often that she feels neglected by her mother ? I do n't think so ! Talk about being hit in the head repeatedly with a fact until it is gushing out your nose ! Then ... something happened . Where earlier their treatment of Emily as their child seemed mild , really just broaching on being overprotective , and maybe just a kinky part of their affair , it gets to the point where she is literally acting like a child . I am talking dressing like a child , playing with toy ponies , and drawing with crayons . And then ... the diaper . Yes . The heroine wears a diaper.And where the author introduced interesting conflict in the beginning ? Nothing really comes of it . We do n't see a confrontation , it just gets dealt with . No , just ... no . I am going to pretend the book ended with the car accident . She dies . The end . Ugh , I have the creeps after reading this story . ( This is the same review I put on goodreads ; that is where I find books , then buy them on Amazon . I may or may not have wanted to put this here as well , just so I could more clearly warn people that the heroes put the heroine IN A DIAPER for a fetish . It is sexual , not a part of necessity . If it were due to illness or physical impairment , then go on , do it . But because you want to change your girlfriend 's diaper ... SEEK HELP )	-1
I am really of two minds about this book . It 's at least as well written as the first one for *most* of its length . The story is reasonably interesting and the character behaviour reasonably believable ... again , for *most* of its length.The problem is , well , the ending ... it 's a mix of almost fantasy wish fulfilment and really trite writing . Worse , it feels as if there should have been a third book , and the 'ending ' should have been expanded to *be* that third book ... it 's just too short , too sketchy and it 's as if the author simply ran out of puff and just wrapped it up overnight , when it really needed a more detailed and better developed ending.Up to that point ? Probably 3-4 Stars ( not quite as good as the first book , which was a 4 Star , pretty much , for a self published effort ) . The ending , however , drags down my opinion to 2-3 Stars at best .	-1
There was nothing in here that a person reading wikipedia could n't figure out . I wish there had been an explanation about how to value a company as well as theories about momentum , etc .	-1
I do n't understand all the 5 star ratings on this book series . I could n't even get through the first book . The writing constantly switching back and forth from one POV to another made it hard to understand who is & # 34 ; talking & # 34 ; . The writing is very juvenile also . Sending back for refund .	-1
This was a free kindle book . When I downloaded , I did n't read the blurb . So I got a shock when I started reading it . It is a erotica . So if you like books with the male being dominant , and the girl being submissive then you may like this one . I guess most people who read this type of book really does not care about the format . The little bit of this book that I did read , I found it to be choppy . The book did not flow .	-1
I did n't like it at all . Glad it was short , wo n't be reading more of the series . Maybe another time or day .	-1
If you enjoy the C.S.Lewis writings , you may not enjoy this book . The author is highly critical of him . Even the attempts to be positive seem to morph into criticisms .	-1
I have to say I stumbled across this book look for a cheap read and crossing my fingers for a good one ! That being said this book had amazing potential but fell short . The editing or should I say & # 34 ; lack of & # 34 ; editing is just sad . There are many parts with words left out of sentences and you kind of just throw your own word in their , heck make it a mad lib ! Also I really had a hard time liking many of the characters . Especially the girl characters because the way they are portrayed throughout is unrealistic . The girls in this book are easy and slutty , with no morals at all . Lee the protagonist is dumb as a sack of bricks . She gets treated like trash by Kyle and goes back to him every time . Also the story is VERY predictable . The & # 34 ; bad lasagna & # 34 ; and the & # 34 ; drinking too much & # 34 ; ummm helloooo ? ? ? ? It is very vulgar and not really a & # 34 ; love story & # 34 ; more like a dirty porn.All of that being said , I did kind of like it . Sometimes you just pick up what the author is putting down . I will get the next book just because I do n't think you should give up on the story , things can change !	-1
I read this booklet Cover-to-Cover ... TWICE . There is some great information about getting up in the morning , but miniscule information on what is ABSOLUTELY essential PRIOR to waking up early and that would be : FALLING ASLEEP . Someone may go to bed `` early '' and not be able to `` sleep '' so how is THAT person going to get 7 to 8 hours ( recommended time ) of ACTUAL sleep ? Alas , the author missed this CRUCIAL element . To wake up early , one must first be able to begin and continue to sleep . I felt this KEY POINT should have been addressed thoroughly , but it was NOT . Sleeping and Waking go hand-in-hand and the system will NOT work if ONE is missing . The mini-info provided is insufficient.Maybe this quick read could be enjoyed by people who are able to merely fall asleep `` on demand '' and thus confidently set their alarm clocks knowing EXACTLY when the 7 to 8 hours are fulfilled ; however , I would venture a guess that they already get up early and without delay .	-1
The way the story unfolded left me feeling like there was n't a true connection between all three characters . The development of their relationship felt disjointed and sometimes forced . I would be surprised if this threesome lasted .	-1
I really could n't get into this book . I skipped several pages and did not finish . This was not for me	-1
I found the story unsatisfying , the voices of the characters unappealing . Sure , I recognize it 's psychological suspense but it did n't rise to being very chilling . I do n't like writing negative reviews but this one did n't make the grade . I found I 'd downloaded another of her books and was not able to finish it either . Maybe it 's me .	-1
Normally i read a full length novel in a full hours . This one took me three days to read about a third of it . I am not sure what was wrong with it . The heroine was not very likable . I liked her friend better . The hero was shallow and the author never did finish him . He never changed but neither did the heroine . her next novel might be better .	-1
This book pissed me off ! Lets start with the positive - Its a lot of book , she def . gave a story ! She kept me reading which is a plus in my opinion . I had to finish to see what was going to happen next . Now the negative - What man any man hood , not hood would allow the crap that was going on . Jyme was three men put together . It was so unreal at times I just put the book down and walk away . And the ending was like ... . really ! All that and still ... . this is how you end the book . What I do n't understand is all those ppl in the casino but Cricket is the one who the police are looking for . All those bodyguards , and she is the only person . It was so fake and horribly unrealistic to me . But again I had to keep reading to see what happen . Then you make Cricket a sweet person , etc ... but her child now hates her ... lol it was just all over the place . Like the author wanted to put every scenario in one book . I 'm pissed I payed for the book to be honest . All I can say is the author def . has a vivid imagination .	-1
I have been using coconut oil for some time and have benefited from it . This book tells you about the advantages but does NOT give specifics , like actual measurements to make a lotion or toothpaste . If you just want to read about coconut oil this book is OK , but if you want recipes or how to , then this is not the book for you . Disappointed ... ...	-1
I normally do n't leave bad reviews . If I do n't like a book , I just do n't review it . But I 'm a little upset that I wasted my money on this book . I rushed to buy it because everyone was saying it was getting banned from Amazon because it was so dark . That made me think it was going to be a great book . I think that was made up to make people buy it before it was gone . I bought it over a month ago and it 's still not banned . I just got around to reading it and now it 's too late to return it for a refund . This was a very poorly written book with tons of grammatical errors . The sex scenes seemed like they were written by a kid . I did n't feel like it was dark at all . I really wanted to stop reading so many times throughout because I was so bored , but I kept pushing myself to keep reading . I 'd hoped it would get better , but it never did . I 'm sorry I wasted my time and money on this book .	-1
One thing I hate is an 8 page free story that the next 8 pages will be $ 2.99 etc . and by the time you finish you have paid $ 12.00 for a total of 99 pages . Okay exaggeration and I do not know if that is what the author is trying to do but first off the story started out good besides a few mistakes but what got me was there was no completion to the story . Please do NOT push publish on an 8 page story with absolutely no resolution at all . I am giving this 2 stars only because of the potential and I did not hate it I only hate the fact that we have nothing to rate but 8 short pages .	-1
I have no sympathy for dishonesty so i just could n't read this book . A woman 's pride basically so selfish it almost seems evil . I realized how judgemental I am as I could n't stand the fact Malia lied to her son , hid from her lover while jeopardiizing her son 's future with her dishonesty . I do n't care it has HEA ending . A women who manipulates , hides and lies does n't deserve it . Yuck.And Brad , ever hear of private detectives ? And you are a lawyer ? How incompetent is that ? Pining away for 17 years ? Really ? Both of thm- TSTL.I love Helen Conrad 's books- but not this one .	-1
I received an ARC of this novel from Netgalley in exchange for an honest review.I know I 'm in the minority here , but I did n't care for this book . In fact , I could n't even finish it.I did n't care for the writing style of this book . There was no real flow and the story came across as disjointed .	-1
I do n't know why I did n't care for this book but , it just did n't work for me . The plot was slow and confused to me and I did n't like the characters inter-action at all.I can see that it was a hit for a lot of people but I just could n't get into it . It was a very slow read for me . - Sorry !	-1
I can officially say I do n't like to read books that recap the entire time . I thought I was going to read a story with dialog that told me what was going on . The story itself was good but I would 've liked to read it as it was taking place .	-1
Conversations run together between the characters in the same paragraph -- which slows the reading and enjoyment as you try to decipher who said what . A rather sophomoric effort in regards to dialogue and emotional depth .	-1
While this book is very well documented , the contents are very amateurish and sounds as if an immature person wrote it . It should have had a better edit . And , too , the writing is too chatty ( too many uses of I , me , my , etc. ) . It reads as if it were written by someone outside the U.S. - since when do we not know that tsp and tb , tbsp , etc. ? Then , later , liter is used instead of US liquid measurement . Too many inconsistencies . I commend the author for his research and the extensive reference list of publications but ca n't recommend the book because of these & # 34 ; rush to get it published & # 34 ; items .	-1
There was no interview , no party , no morals , no self respect , or reason in this book , whatsoever.Just a story about a young girl being taken advantage of , because she was down on her luck and desperate . She was degraded , and used , and highly mistreated . And it did n't matter that she somehow managed to convince herself that she liked it , wanted it or had to do it . It was a slap in the face to professional women everywhere . Basically saying that if she even had a chance to be anything in the company , it would be her under a man or in between two men . Other wise , make these copies for me and have them on my desk by noon . WHAT ! Really ? Absolutely no realism , this book was just a sorry , sad excuse for a fantasy . And I found it just as disturbing as a good horror story .	-1
This book was not good . It jumped all over the place and made no sense whatsoever . This book was like 10 stories in one and neither of the stories was ever finished . I would not recommend . Sorry !	-1
I do n't review many books , and usually only when I really like the book , but this one was a bit disturbing . I think & # 34 ; Not my cup of tea & # 34 ; review was spot on .	-1
Although not my favorite type of books ( light S & M ) , I can usually tolerate a little bit if I like the characters . Beware this book was disturbing because of the interaction between the two . No safe words or other things that make the topic a little less disturbing . If this were a heterosexual couple it would be considered domestic violence because the main character was extremely controlling and masked punishment as being for the person 's own good . It is one thing to have two consenting adults enjoy spanking , it did not appear as thought this was what was happening . It was also kind of disturbing because although both characters were over 18 , it 's like there was some kind of Lolita like overtone . I absolutely did not understand the relationship at all . No depth to the characters either . There was a lot of grammars problems with the book as well .	-1
Meg is supposed to be a lawyer but lord does she ever have TSTL moments . She thinks Greyson is a human trafficker but willing allows him to do whatever he wants to her . I 'm sorry ... but that 's not sexy . She knows something is n't right at the club but she continues to stay there . Maybe she went to remedial law school or something because clearly she is n't the brightest bulb . But , I 'm invested and I want to know what all this & # 34 ; devil incarnate & # 34 ; foolishness is about so I 'll read the last book .	-1
but yes a glutton for punishment bought the series , regrets	-1
Compared to the Ex Games , I wasnt a fan of the Private Club series . Its written like the guy is up to no good and has some deep dark secret , but its not a dark thing . IDK , I just couldnt feel it very much .	-1
Not a good read , sorry it just got my attention . Have never read any of her books , not to say I will not	-1
Nobody reads erotica for mental growth ; but this story was dumber than most stories . No man who is falling in love with someone treats the female as this man did .	-1
I do n't know how I even got through this atrocious story . The story left much to be believed , it was far from steamy and bordered on plain rank . Save your coins ladies , cheap sex with a ridiculous plot .	-1
Tank and ill were great . Just did not flow like a story should . Could be a great book if it read more like a story . Do n't think I would recommend this book . Meds	-1
I finished this book , and I do n't know why . I have read some books like this and was unable to get through most of them . This is the type of book that ... everything goes too well . The good characters are REALLY good . They are understanding and easy to get along with . They are supportive of each other . They also have incredible skills and items that make everything they face seem as daunting as a walk in a park . The 'bad ' guys or antagonists are pathetic . They are the type that monologues and incompetent to the utmost degree.Some of them have their own charms this is true but they do n't have any flaws that make them seem real . Alex is just over the top in all respects . He takes everything in stride , nothing actually affects him . He is great at everything he does and is ridiculously understanding.I wont be buying book 2 . The antagonists are essentially a name . No true threat to the main characters is hinted at and parts of the story are so heavily foreshadowed ( they basically just tell you what will happen ) it takes what little may have been an interesting development into a forgone conclusion .	-1
Very few recipes that I would try . It was interesting to see the recipes but they looked like they tasted yuck to me . There are lots of tasty low carb breakfasts that take less prep and fewer kinds of unusual flours and ingredients . The book was free so I did n't waste money . Would not have gotten if had cost me anything . This is for Real Gungho Health Nut Enthusiasts I would imagine ... . those who Think they are going health . Aspartame was an ingredient used in some recipes . Aspartame is not even good for you ! Better to use sugar for health !	-1
Like others I was excited when the third book came out - especially since the last book left us with such a cliffhanger . I loved Syn in the first books . She was a strong willed , ruthless assassin - what 's not to love ? I found The Fae Chronicles because I was looking for a strong female heroine and the first two book completely delivered . There was a complete disconnect between the Syn of the first two books and the Syn in Escaping Destiny.~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~SPOILER BELOW~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~Syn cried so much or wrestled with & # 34 ; unshed tears & # 34 ; so much that I was completely over the waterworks ! We are n't not talking tears because her best friend die - like in the previews books . We talking & # 34 ; everybody is being mean to me & # 34 ; and & # 34 ; he is not giving me enough attention & # 34 ; tears . Yes , she is pregnant but come on ! Kick butt assassin to & # 34 ; he is not giving me enough attention & # 34 ; crying ? In addition to this , the dialog was repetitive and cheesy - I laughed out loud several times at the verbiage . Can you really read & # 34 ; precious womb & # 34 ; and not laugh ? I kept picture Gollum form Lord of the Rings ! As for the characters themselves , them seemed like washed out versions of their previous self . Ryder was a complete caveman . Do n't get me wrong , I love an alpha hero , but I like one with depth . Ryder was one-dimensional and Syn was crying every chapter for the first half for the book . All the favorite characters made cameo appearance but they were also flat.I was so frustrated because all the previous issues were completely swept under the rug . Apparently , Adam is magically over Syn now . Syn not mad at Ryder for chopping her brother 's hand off because he is really sorry . Ryder lies ( twist words ) to Syn all the time and she just laughs it off & # 34 ; Oh , you Fairy & # 34 ; . Anytime Syn actually got mad for righteous reasons , Ryder would resolve the issue with his magic male part - presto chango everything fixed.Ryder calls Syn 'pet & # 34 ; every single time he talks to her and she basically does become his pet . Again , do n't get me wrong , I love erotic scene but you get over it when every other scene is sex.I know I am going against the normal but I really do miss our hard as nails heroine ! Hopefully , we see her come back in future novels !	-1
I think I may be done with this series . It started out so promising but has taken a left and has yet to back on track . My main problem is Ryder being the & # 8220 ; hero & # 8221 ; . He is a complete ass . He is a liar , abuser , and tyrant . He came up with the excuse of his Daddy made him do it for things , but none of his actions during the last 22 years can not be blamed on his father . His killing Syn & # 8217 ; s first love , his torture of her brother , his killing human woman , and his obsession with Syn that he originally thought would end in her death . There are a few lame attempts to make him out to be a & # 8220 ; good & # 8221 ; guy , but then he squashes that with his complete lack of remorse for his past deeds . Syn seems to be suffering from multiple personality disorder because she is back and forth with what she will put up with . And her determination to make a man love her , a man who told her he is incapable of love is maddening . He doesn & # 8217 ; t love her , he is obsessed with her . He referred to her as a drug , and that is exactly what she is to him . And I really hate the sex scene & # 8217 ; s where he starts with her , she says no , and he keeps going anyway and it becomes sexy her to because he is a dom . Uh , no . Isn & # 8217 ; t a dom/sub relationship supposed to be about trust . How can you trust someone who never stops when you tell them to . Those scene & # 8217 ; s feel like rape , but Syn is somehow morphed into being turned on . I was also annoyed by Adam . All of a sudden , out of the blue , he is completely cool with Ryder and Syn being together . He was just madly in love with her at the beginning of the book , and then when he finally reappears in the middle he & # 8217 ; s totally cool with everything . That one sentence explanation was crap . And Adam and Syn & # 8217 ; s bond seems to be completely gone . How did that happen ? And we know who the Horde King is now , what a crappy reveal . So disappointed ... **********************************Spoilers***************************************************The Horde King is Ryder . Really ? Syn asked him and he said no . He lied . He & # 8217 ; s not supposed to be able to do that . His reasoning of not being coronated is a bunch of crap . He is the sole heir , the old king died , and he has been committing acts as the King for the past 22 years . Therefore he is and was the Horde King . It would & # 8217 ; ve been more interesting if he wasn & # 8217 ; t. If his father was still alive , and took Syn . And she was the Light Heir fated to have children to save their world with Adam . It would & # 8217 ; ve been nice to see Ryder earn Syn & # 8217 ; s love and devotion , and test his resolve to & # 8220 ; have & # 8221 ; her.Also Syn said she wanted those babies but she acted more like someone who was secretly trying to miscarry . She is carrying twins which among normal , healthy , young , strong , human women is still considered a high risk pregnancy . Among the Fae who have a high miscarriage and infant mortality rate , and who only have one case ever in their multi millennial history of twins , the risk is astronomical . But she was drinking coffee , having extremely rough sex , going on a weeks long horseback journey , and fighting . And now she & # 8217 ; s Danu & # 8217 ; s daughter too . Syn has to many damn parents . It is no longer shocking when a person is added to her parental roster .	-1
Rating : 2 StarsMore from Mason and Ava in a short novella that extends their book life . Really , I do n't know how much more Ava 's poor body can take . Same drama happened in previous books in the series . I think I continue to read this because I like Mason and Ava . I need to put this up for a while , we both need a break ! Why Not 5 Stars ? This is becoming stale for me . It 's the same kidnapping and beat down drama with Ava . I did not find anything new and creative . The foursome scene the next day after Ava 's drama ... boring , cheesy and unrealistic . Ava must be the new bionic woman . She does not need to go to the hospital to heal anymore . Just have sex and it 's business as usual . Ugh !	-1
