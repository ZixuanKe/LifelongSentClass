I pretty much shop exclusively in the natural/organic food department in my grocery store and those few times that I have strayed and read labels I was always reminded why I do n't shop in the normal part of the grocery store . These bars are not bad at all . So many others I have looked at have hidden artificial sweeteners ( like aspartame ) in them , but not these , only 8 grams of sugar per bar ( our household limit is 9 grams per serving of any food ) and there is a tiny bit of stevia , but I have no problem with that since I am a big stevia believer . These have only 130 calories so it can be a snack ( if a protein bar gets to be too high in calories it really ought to be a meal replacement ) and these are chocolatey enough to satisfy my chocolate craving . These have 3 grams of fiber , not so much , but then these are not trying to be fiber bars . These bars have 9 grams of protein , not bad , but it appears to be all soy based , but since it is not SO much protein I guess that is fine ( too much soy is not good ) . There is some palm oil which I am not a fan of ( not ecologically sound and it is cholesterol raising ) , but few processed foods out there are perfect . I would recommend these to anyone who needs a little something sweet and chocolatey that is low enough in calories to be a snack and who is n't so hung up on natural/organic foods . From what I 've seen in the conventional food isles these are quite clean and they taste good . While I say that I recommend them , for me personally I will still go back to buying my old standby in the natural foods department , NuGo Slim .	1
So I typically do n't like bars with a lot of chemicals . I have tried South Beach products before , never a huge fan but willing to give new products a try . The Protein Fit cereal bar I tried was chocolate and has 9 grams of protein and 3 grams of fiber . To me the big selling point was no artificial sweeteners ( they use sugar , stevia and cane syrup instead . ) The ingredients number 20 or so , but I understand this is because it needs to have a certain shelf life . For me , the taste is ok , not delicious , but not bad either . Would I choose this for a snack ? If it was paired with something else to `` wash it down , '' like an apple . It 's not filling on it 's own , though I guess for some people it would be . All in all , a decent choice , and a good flavor .	1
Individually-wrapped , the Peanut Butter South Beach Diet Protein Fit Cereal Bar actually looks like the attractive product photo on the box . It 's tasty , and weighing in at 5 grams of saturated fat , 7 grams sugar , does n't weigh on your conscience . The only draw-back is it 's so good , you might be tempted to eat several in a sitting , but of course you know , that 's not the point .	1
I try not to eat too much in between meals , but often when I 'm out shopping or waiting in an office somewhere those hunger pangs sneak up on me . I used to always take a banana or a cheese stick , but lately have been pampering myself with more tasty nourishment.I 've tried different protein bars , so thought I 'd give these a try . Boy , am I glad I did ! They 're an energizing pick-me-up packed with protein and fiber . But what makes them stand out from the pack is that they 're more crunchy and flavorful . Natural whole grains combined with peanut buttery soy crisps and drizzled with peanut butter coating ! YUM ! ! ! ( And did I mention the healthy vitamins and minerals ? ) And what a very `` cute '' name : GOOD TO GO ! That says a lot !

I enjoyed these bars although I really did n't need either the fiber or their low-calorie aspect . They were flavorful , and I found them almost too chocolate-y , notwithstanding the comments of some other reviewers who found the bars tasteless or the chocolate unpleasant . I eat two meals during the work day , and I found these bars to be a great alternative to a candy bar in the afternoon ( about half the calories of a Power bar and the benefit of fiber ! ) . At current prices , each bar nets out at 68 cents and they are also more economical than a trip to the snack bar or candy machine . But be careful with these if you are eating these in dress clothes - the chocolate melted on my fingers as I ate the bars . The only reason I did not give these bars five stars is that they sat a bit heavily in my stomach after eating . Recommended if you 're looking for a tasty , chewy fiber bar that feels more like a candy bar than a granola bar .	1
This product has a strong cinnamon flavor- very pleasant , and is quite reasonable at $ 20 for 40 bars ( a bit cheaper under the subscription program ) . However , Zone Perfect bars ( available in many flavors ) , while more expensive , have a crunchy moister texture , higher protein , about the same carbs and fiber , and higher fat ( to make you feel fuller ) . Both products are `` all natural '' , without artificial flavors . Personally , I 'd rather spend more for the Zone Perfect bars , which have great flavor and texture and are more filling than the South Beach bars .	1
While I prefer crunchy granola bars , chewy bars such as these are good change of pace once in a while.These bars are supposed to contribute to `` healthy snacking '' as part of the South Beach Diet . For `` diet food '' they 're not too bad . They 're sweet and chewy with a nice cinnamon flavor . Those crispy bits ? Nope , they 're not rice crispies but `` soy protein nuggets . '' The rest of the ingredients are pretty normal , as well . It was nice to see they have no artificial flavors or sweeteners.Though these are called `` cinnamon raisin '' bars there only a few tiny specks of raisin bits that do n't really add to the flavor in any way . When you 're finished , there are no unpleasant aftertastes like some `` healthy '' bars can have.Overall , I would have to say I was pleasantly surprised by these bars . It makes me think that sticking to the South Beach Diet would n't be that bad . But the hard part of sticking to this diet would be only eating one of the bars time .	1
Fiber ? I got yer fiber right here . A big 9 g of it , baby , 36 % of your daily requirement . Dark chocolate , VERY dark , lots of crunchiness , big satisfaction whether you 're looking for fiber , chocolate , or just to calm the tummy rumbles . Yep , South Beach rules .	1
Fifty cents a pop , 130 calories , protein , a little bit of carbs for energy , some vitamins/minerals , fiber ... These are good little diet bars . A much better choice than a candy bar or a soda if you 're bored / got the munchies and looking for something with a little more bite than fruit or carrots or something.These are great for at your desk at work , bike/beach trip , etc . They 're nice and chewy , so even though they 're small they take a little while to eat and it makes them seem like a more substantial snack than they are .	1
The South Beach Fiber Bar Dark Chocolate comes in a box with five individually wrapped granola bars . The nutritional information and ingredients are listed both on the individual wrappers and the box they all came in.For a packaged bar that has 9g of dietary fiber , the taste is pretty good ! It does indeed have a dark chocolate flavor to it . The first and third item in the list of ingredients are cocoa and cocoa powder . As others have observed , it is not as chewy , but I actually prefer it as it is . Maybe you burn an extra calorie while chewing it : ) It is definitely not crunchy , just not chewy chewy.Each bar has 120 calories , with 3.5 fat ( 2g saturated , 0g trans ) , 0mg cholesterol , 100mg sodium , 80mg potassium , 22g carbs ( 9g dietary fiber , 6g sugars ) , 6g of protein and single-digit percentages of iron and calcium.The list of ingredients is long , and it includes some of the usual things one can find in packaged food . Obviously you do n't have to be nutritionist to understand that it is better to get your nutrition from fresh fruits and veggies and their friends . However , not everyone has the flexibility of eating fresh food all the time , so this bar looks to me like a good source of fiber that also moonlights as a reasonably tasty chocolaty dessert.The expiration date was found at the bottom of the box , on the outside , white font on a brown chocolaty background and was easy to read : APR 30 2013 .	1
Got these in the peanut butter flavor and I thought they were quite tasty . They 're not going to be quite as delicious as a regular , non-protein bar of course , but considering that they 're healthy I thought they were a great alternative to a regular fattening snack . Really good for something to tide you over between meals .	1
the flavor is very nice and the only reason i did n't give it 5 stars was becasue it was too hard to bite into . i recently just had some dental work and i was afraid it would break my cap.i broke it into little pieces and ate it that way and it really did hold me over between my workout and my dinner.nice product , no aftertaste , great flavor but it was just too hard for me .	1
For a diet bar this is n't bad . But is 130 calories really a `` diet bar ? '' Thirty calories are from fat.This bar does taste like a cinnamon roll . It 's not soft like a cinnamon roll , nor is the texture much like one , but for a bar made for a snack I like it . I can take these with me hiking for quick energy without them crumbling apart , a big for me since I take a lot of things on a hike .	1
I 've had poor luck with the `` better for you '' protein bars I 've tried so far , but this is proving to be the exception . The taste is quite good ! The cinnamon comes through nicely and it 's pleasantly sweet . Where it falls down a bit is with regard to texture . It 's soft and chewy ( which is a plus ) , but has a bit of a gritty texture . While it 's not as bad as many other protein bars , it 's still noticeable.Although the bar is small , it 's pretty filling . One bar was enough to make be feel as if I had a decent size snack . The bar is just a bit sticky , but remains easy to eat without needing a wet nap to clean up after.While I still prefer a traditional soft granola bar in terms of taste , this does offer a much better nutritional profile than a granola bar . Definitely worth a shot if you 're looking for a calorie controlled , better for you type of snack .	1
The pluses : price , 9g of protein , and the chocolaty flavor , which is better than the other bars I have tried . I also like the crunchy texture The `` cons '' : too sweet for me , and very dry . I have to drink a lot of water after each one .	1
I 've tried several of these bars and this one is among my favorites . I had triedSouth Beach Diet Protein Fit Cereal Bar , Peanut Butter , 5-Count ( Pack of 8 ) and had mentioned it seemed a little dry . This peanut butter flavor on the other hand did n't seem that way at all . It was actually just like I would 've hoped the other bar would be , the texture of a dense moist rice crispy treat.I really enjoy the high protein & low fat content of these bars . They are not quite high enough for a post workout snack per serving , but definitely great as a pick me up for hunger pains between meals . Personally I only eat bars high in protein & this is one of the most affordable protein bars out there . If you are looking for 20 gram protein bars , then compare these to those . It 's very similar in calories & the cost is often less than a $ 1 for two South Beach bars , compared to $ 1- $ 2 for one of the other brand 's bars . These are small bars so consider that too . At only 140 calories , that is approximately 1/2 to 1/3 of the calories of a normal high protein bar.As a diet tool , this does have a great balance of calories . But as a training tool , do a little bit of math & see that it can be helpful there too if you 'd like to save a few bucks .	1
Yum ! When I read a review that these tasted like S'mores , I did n't really believe it . I was wrong . They are so good that it is like eating a S'mores candy bar . I feel like I am being so bad , when really I am being good . For how many you get this is an absolute steal .	1
Love the taste of the South Beach Cinnamon Raisin cereal bars . There is n't a funny or off taste here . No artificial or after taste either . The taste is that of an appley-cinnamon taste . Not overly cinnamon-spicy.It has 130 calories , 18g carbs , 3g fiber , and 9g of protein which makes for a good , healthy snack , although I do n't consider that low carb if you are looking at this thinking it would be because it 's South Beach . This is at the very top of how many carbs that I 'm allowed since I am on a low carb diet because of health reasons.As for taste , they taste great , even the kids liked them .	1
I have tried dozens of various protein/meal replacement/snack bars , and after a while they all tend to taste about the same . Some have great nutritional profiles , while others fare worse than even a Snickers . So I did not have high hopes for the South Beach Diet Protein Fit bar , thinking it would just be another Atkins-type snack bar . I was quite wrong , which I hate to admit.The Chocolate Protein Fit bar has a satisfying texture , somewhat akin to a Rice Krispies Treat ; somewhere in the trenches between moist and crunchy . The flavor is absolutely on-point and satisfying , neither too sweet nor too bland . And nutritionally these bars are on the healthier side , with just 140 calories , 3g Fiber , a vitamin spectrum , only 125mg of Sodium ( most protein bars I 've had were loaded with sodium ) and no high-fructose corn syrup.Here is the full nutritional breakdown , for those who might be curious : Calories : 140 ( 35g ) Total Fat : 4.5g ( 7 % ) Saturated Fat : 2.5g ( 13 % ) Cholesterol : 0mgSodium : 125mg ( 5 % ) Potassium : 160mg ( 5 % ) Total Carbohydrate : 17g ( 6 % ) Dietary Fiber : 3g ( 12 % ) Sugars : 8gProtein : 9gINGREDIENTS : Protein blend ( soy crisp [ soy protein isolate , rice starch ] , soy protein concentrate , defatted soy grits ) , brown rice syrup , chocolate coating ( dried cane syrup , palm kernel oil , cocoa powder , soy protein isolate , soy lecithin [ an emulsifier ] , and vanilla extract ) , crisp rice ( rice flour , sugar , salt , malt ) , invert cane syrup , safflower oil , oats , chicory root extract , polydextrose , chocolate liquor , nonfat dry milk , natural flavor , whey ( milk ) , calcium carbonate , dried cane syrup , soy lecithin ( an emulsifier ) , vegetable glycerin , salt , nutrition blend ( niacinamide , vitamin B6 [ pryidoxine hydrochlroide ] , vitamin B12 [ cyanocobalamin ] , riboflavin , folic acid , vitamin B1 [ thiamin hydrochloride ] ) , stevia extract , beta carotene , zinc and iron blend ( zinc [ zinc oxide ] , reduced iron ) .For those who avoid soy , this is not the bar for you , as soy is the primary source of protein used here . Truthfully , my preference is for whey , or a whey/soy protein blend , but the soy crisps were really satisfying in the end.Overall , at a fairly modest price point , I think the South Beach Diet Protein bars are a viable option for a mid-afternoon snack , something to give you enough energy for a couple of hours , and a great alternative to those who eat Atkins or other similar bars !	1
I love peanut butter , I thought it was just a summer thing , but no , we 're definitely in a lifelong relationship . I was really hoping these bars would pack a strong peanut buttery punch then they did . They are good , they satisfy your sweet tooth , but I really would have liked more peanutty zing to it . It lacked that extra flavor .	1
Delicious ! I 'm not on a diet to lose weight , but am on a rather restrictive medical diet that demands I keep my ingestion of proteins within a certain level . I 'll definitely be keeping the South Beach diet Protein Fit Cinnamon Raisin bars on my list of special treats to boost my protein levels in a natural , healthy way . The taste was excellent with the cinnamon and raisin mixture at the forefront . There was n't any cardboard or artificial sweetener ( there is Stevia in the ingredients ) tang or aftertaste to spoil the taste . In fact there are n't any artificial flavors or sweeteners in this product , which happens to be made in Canada for those who like to know where their products emanate from.However , if you are on a diet , South Beach or otherwise , you 'll find that at 130 calories per bar this will satisfy your craving for sweets . It did n't fill me up for hours on end , but did satisfy my sweet tooth naturally and give me a snack I can look forward to . The flavor actually reminded me of a cinnamon roll , something I would like , but can not have . Perhaps if you are on a weight loss diet you 'll also appreciate the taste of these bars without the heavy calorie load . The nine grams of protein in these bars are just enough to round I my needs on days I 'm not getting enough.There are several weight loss plans online , but South Beach does offer a free 14 day program for those interested . This includes 24/7 support , recipes , and access to a supportive community . Back to these bars . On their website South Beach claims that the `` Protein Fit Cereal Bars are a delicious and wholesome snack option . They are perfect when you 're hungry for a snack that is crunchy and sweet . They 're part of our strategic snacking ( tm ) plan to help you avoid empty calories . They taste delicious and are a good source of protein and fiber and contain no artificial flavors , sweeteners , or sugar alcohols . '' Below I 've listed links for those who want to try other types of snack bars if these prove to be a hit . I certainly enjoyed them and will keep them on my grocery list ... the special one.SOUTH BEACH DIET - PROTEIN FIT BARS : South Beach Diet Protein Fit Cereal Bar , Peanut ButterSouth Beach Diet Bar Protein Fit Cereal Bar , ChocolateSouth Beach Diet Protein Fit 5 Cereal Bars , Cinnamon RaisinINGREDIENTS ( Cinnamon Raisin ) : Soy protein nuggets ( soy protein isolate , tapioca starch , salt ) , tapioca syrup , rolled oats , raisins , chicory root fiber , sugar , fructose , fractionated palm kernel oil , water , soy protein isolate , butter ( cream , salt ) , nonfat milk , maltodextrin , cinnamon , calcium carbonate , natural flavor , soy lecithin , nonfat yogurt powder ( cultured nonfat milk ) , salt , dextrose , caramel added for color , stevia extract , niacinamide , ferric orthophosphate , ascorbic acid , zinc oxide , pyrdoxine hydrochloride , riboflavin , thiamine monoitrate , vitamin a acetate , folic acid , vitamin B12.ALLERGEN INFORMATION : Contains milk , soybean .

This reviewer was pleasantly surprised to find this South Beach Diet breakfast bar to be both tasty and reasonably healthy . The bar promises 9 grams of protein and 3 grams of fiber in a cinnamon-raisin flavored cereal bar at the cost of just 130 calories per bar . That is a decent start to a busy day in a portable and all natural form . Highly recommended .	1
My biggest gripe with these is I wish they had more than 5 to a box ! The taste is enjoyable , ingredients are not questionable and I like that it has protein to enjoy post-workout . The bars withstand being thrown in a bag haphazardly without breaking into tons of little pieces or getting dented up ( ca n't say the same for some of those more soft cereal bars ) . A big plus that it can be an on-the-go kind of snack . These are n't too messy to eat either which helps for portability . This was my first foray into the South Beach Diet line and look forward to trying out other flavors soon .	1
I shared the South Beach Diet Protein Fit Cereal Bars with my husband and mother and we all agreed that the bars were tasty , had a good `` chocolate '' taste , were not too chewy or too sweet and had a fantastic flavor . My mom has diabetes and always has something with protein next to her bed in case her sugar level drops during the night . She ate the South Beach bar when that happened and it leveled her off and lasted all through the night . It is easy to stick one of these bars in your purse or the glove compartment of the car and be prepared for a hunger attack while out and about . We all agreed that we will buy this product again .	1
I was very happy to try these cereal bars as I am a vegetarian that is always happy to find a product that is tasty , high in protein , and low in calories and sugars . The chocolate flavor is more a `` cocoa '' flavor , but still appetizing and high in fiber as well . I was so impressed that I have already gone out to buy more , in both chocolate and peanut butter flavor . If you are on the South beach Diet ( I 'm not ) , these are indicated to be for Phases 2 & 3 . Good flavor , good value , and healthy as well .	1
This is one of the nicest candy bars I have ever tasted . Perfect size , not too wide , not too thin , not too soft and not too hard . The combined flavors are of crushed soy protein nuggets , peanuts , fructose for sweetening and a tang of tapioca . In some ways it is reminiscent of a granola bar , but far more tasty . There are no artificial flavors or sweeteners , and you can really tell.The only ingredient I am concerned about is the palm kernel oil . I hope it is not from Indonesia , where orangatuns are being slaughtered by the palm oil industrialists and their numbers are dwindling . Hopefully this oil comes from a humane mileau.It really is low fat , with only 5g of total fat , and no trans fat . There is no cholesterol - the salt level is a little high at 160 mg . There is even 9g of protein.It is medium crunchy and oh so tasty . I will be picking this up at my local supermarket whenever I have a sweet tooth .	1
These bars were surprisingly tasty and we enjoyed each and every one of them . They had a full rich chocolatey flavor mixed in with a little crunch in the bite with caramel type topping . One regret is there were not more of them . For a diet bar these were amazing in flavor and hard to believe they are considered diet . A lot of times you get a after flavor with these types of `` diet '' food . Not so with these . If you want a great alternative snack for a desert this is one I would recommend .	1
Often when you see the word `` diet '' on a snack package , it 's code for mediocre or even downright gross . Not so with the South Beach diet dark chocolate-flavored fiber bars . The first ingredient listed is cocoa soy crisp followed by cocoa powder . This must account for both the crispy , chewy texture when you bite into one and the strong but not overpowering chocolate taste . ( cocoa powder is listed twice for some reason , followed by chocolate liquor and cocoa butter further down on the ingredient list ) . Each bar according to the package is 120 calories with 30 calories from fat . My package , which was a Vine sample , contained five bars . Overall , one bar was enough to fill me up for a snack or dessert , was not too gummy or messy , and had a faint but not unpleasant aftertaste . I 'm not a huge dark chocolate fan , but these were very good .	1
If you are looking for a sweet treat that wo n't add guilt to your enjoyment , try these ! They are really chewy and chocolaty - much more chocolate flavor than most & # 34 ; fake & # 34 ; bars . No weird aftertaste , either , because they do n't contain artificial sweetners ! Still , they are low in sugar and high in protien and a perfect craving reliever ! I almost hate to write such a good review because I do n't want them to go out of stock ! ! ! !	1
I ca n't speak to the nutritional value of these bars , but in terms of flavor their delicious . The flavor is a very rich peanut butter flavor . The consistency of the bar is so soft it almost melts in your mouth . It 's almost a bit too gooey and soft , so be careful if you 're eating it out in public.I should add this is the first version of the South Beach Peanut Butter Bar I 've tasted , so I ca n't compare it to the original version . But at 100 calories it still has a very rich taste .	1
Normally chocolate-flavored diet/fiber bars taste only mildly of chocolate , but these had a truly rich chocolatey , almost fudge-like taste . A quick look at the list of ingredients reveals that there are 4 separate cocoa or chocolate ingredients present , so that explains the taste . Of course , there 's also a fair amount of sugar in these bars , but with 120 calories and 9 grams of fiber , I 'm happy to enjoy them ! In addition to the great taste , these bars also have a very nice consistency . They are similar to a rice crispy treat , but a good deal less chewy . There is a solid chocolate layer on the bottom and more chocolate drizzled on top , but they were n't soft or messy to eat.The only downside is that these are small ( that 's why they are only 120 calories after all ) . Even with 9 grams of fiber and 6 grams of protein , they did n't put much of a dent in my appetite . I definitely would need more than 1 for a snack .	1
Generally speaking , I have trouble with a lot of protein snacks , as they usually try to pack in the protein with a lot of nuts that I 'm a allergic to . This South Beach Diet bar is a welcome exception . It 's basically a crisped rice snack coated in a waxy chocolate - no nuts -and while that does n't sound all the exciting , it is actually quite tasty . It has a good balance of carbs and fat with the protein as well , and because it is tasty , it 's easy ( even desirable ) to eat . It leaves me feeling full and alleviates any tendency to head for the vending machine or candy jar . The chocolate held up well in both my regular carry bag and my lunch box , and was n't even too mushy after being left in a warm ( not overly hot ) car . That leaves me with : tastes good , is good for me , goes anywhere . That makes this a winner of a snack .	1
I 'd compare the South Beach Diet Protein Fit Peanut Butter Cereal Bar to Rice Krispies with peanut butter drizzled on top . It has a good flavor , but does n't feel as substantial as some protein bars . And at 9g of protein per bar , its protein content is only average . And while the package says no artificial flavors or sweeteners , it certainly has a lot of hard-to-pronounce ingredients listed.Does it taste good ? Sure . Is it better than other protein bars ? Not really . In fact , I think it lacks the substance and protein that other similarly priced bars have . It 's all about the brand name , because the South Beach Diet is recognized as a popular diet . You could easily get similar results from Rice Krispies dipped in peanut butter .	1
I like the taste of these protein bars ( especially the drizzle on top ) , and they help me make it through the period between breakfast and lunch when I have a tendency to snack . They 're only 130 calories , and pretty filling .	1
I like the convenience of protein bars for an on-the-go snack that fits in a purse or bag . I 've been in search of a bar like this for a while because most other protein bars I 've tried either are n't satisfying or have as many calories and fat as a big candy bar . These South Beach bars have a very rich cocoa flavor that chocolate lovers will appreciate . They 're only 130 calories but still have a good amount of protein to keep hunger at bay between meals . They 're also much lower in sugar than similar bars in this category but it does n't affect the taste . They are just the right balance of low calorie , great taste and still very satisfying . I have already ordered my second box of these .	1
Usually when I look for a protein bar , I look for something that is lower in calories in fat . However , many of the leading brands that are high in protein also contain well over 200-300 calorie . The only bar that I have found that is lower in calories is the Pria bar , and that bar is quite small and has only 5 grams of protein and 1 gram of fiber.Pros : -Only 140 calories and 5 grams of fat ; fits my breakfast calorie goals perfectly.-Contains 9 grams of protein and 3 grams of fiber which helped keep me full longer.-Easy to grab and toss in your purse or carry with you when hunger strikes.-Tasty for a protein bar ; there was a little bit of a grainy texture as there is in most protein bars , but the peanut butter flavor was strong , and the bar was crisp from the crispy rice cereal . There was also a drizzle of peanut butter on the top for peanut butter lovers.Cons : -There is a slightly grainy texture to the bar which is to be expected from a protein bar.-You ca n't keep them in your car on a cold day . I discovered they were as hard as a rock.So , weighing the pros and cons , would I purchase these again ? I think I would . I did give them four stars rather than five because there is a slightly grainy texture to them , but overall , they fit my nutritional goals and needs.Additionally , my one-year-old son stole my first bar . I left it unwrapped on the table and came back to find him eating it , so it 's safe to say my children will like it too . If my children will eat something healthy , I 'm sure to buy it !	1
I was a HUGE fan of their previous SB Smore 's fiber bars , which apparently they stopped making ( all fiber bars were gone from the shelves for a while ; guess they were revamping their product ) . I had high hopes for this bar . Taste wise , I did n't get the taste of 'dark chocolate ' , just an overload of chocolatey in general . I prefer the taste of true dark chocolate , so this bar was a let down . I was also hoping for something a bit chewier or softer . Still , the bar was a good snack and I might buy them again if the price is right , just to keep something chocolately around when the craving occurs .	1
Four thirty in the morning . Still 3 1/2 hours to go before I can go home . Let 's see what 's tucked away in my bag ; oh wow , a South Beach Cinnamon Raisin bar ! I have to admit , this hit the spot . Just enough to get me over the hump and give me enough pep to keep going.I have n't had a South Beach snack product yet that I dislike , and the fact that this had cinnamon in it gave it high marks . I 'd probably eat a boot with cinnamon on it . This is considerably nicer than a boot .	1
I have always been a fan of these types of diet snacks so I tried these out . I have to say that i really enjoyed them and thought that they were very good . I would recommend them to any one even those not looking to loose weight , they do taste very good .	1
Any granola bar drizzled with chocolate tends to invite suspicion with regard to how much nutrition it could offer as well as how many calories it 's packing . But this bar has quite a bit of fiber ( 9 g [ 36 % DV ] ) and protein ( 6 g [ 12 % DV ] ) without too much in the way of calories ( 120 [ 30 from fat ] ) , fat ( 3.5 g [ 5 % DV ] ) , sugar ( 22 g [ 7 % DV ] ) or sodium ( 100 mg [ 4 % DV ] ) . I scanned the product 's UPC with the mobile app MyNetDiary and the nutritional `` food score '' for a bar rated as a whopping +4.6 . Compare this with my usual breakfast foods : a package of Chobani fat-free peach Greek yogurt gets a score of +2.2 while a large banana garners a mere +1.7 . Apparently this dark chocolate bar has a lot to offer . With regard to texture , it 's crispy inside ( like a Krackel bar ) and covered-for the most part-in dark chocolate , which leaves a lingering though not unpleasant dark chocolate aftertaste . I would get these again .	1
Remember coming into your grandma 's house , the sweet smell of cinnamon and raisins wafting in the air ? You knew before you took the first bite that those delicious oatmeal cookies would melt on your tongue as you gobbled them hot from the oven ? Remember as well how young you were and how easy it was to burn the calories away running in her yard ? Well , `` South Beach Diet Protein Fit 5 Cereal Bars '' are not quite as yummy ( we are talking grandma 's house , people ) but they are much better for the older body that does n't have quite the zeal . They are tinged with cinnamon , a crunchy crackling of oats with raisins adding moisture to the whole mixture . No guilt on enjoying one because there is n't a sugar jar in them.Tasty and quick . For the aroma maybe a quick stop in the micro after unwrapping.Enjoy .	1
These South Beach Diet dark chocolate bars hit the spot . All forms of chocolate have been my downfall throughout my life as I tried to control my weight.These are designed for people like me . A great snack that is not out of line.Loved them .	1
If you like dark chocolate and are looking for a reduced calorie snack , then this is something you should try . While taste , by definition , is very subjective , I found the rich dark chocolate taste to be slightly too rich . But , again , your mileage may vary . Otherwise , the snack bar was very enjoyable ; it 's a decent size and , while labeled as a fiber bar , it really does n't taste like a fiber bar . The bar is chewy and not crunchy.One very positive aspect of the bar is that after eating one , I really felt full and satisfied . I presume the richness of the dark chocolate quenched the appetite . I really do n't feel hungry again until several hours after eating one .	1
And this is supposed to be good for you ! The only trouble with these cereal bars is that I 'm tempted to eat too many of them because they are so tasty . They 've got raisins , they 've got cinnamon - they 've even got a little zigzag of icing on top , for heaven 's sake ! They 've also got protein and other good stuff under the hood , so it 's a win-win situation . They are handy for me to stash in the car for trips or in my school bag for long teaching days .	1
I find the South Beach Cinnamon Raisin cereal bars to be pretty tasty but with a bit of a cinnamon aftertaste . They are pretty filling though . I do like there is a minimum of sugar and higher in protein .	1
Some think that you can not have good taste with fiber or that chocolate can be part of a diet bar , but this granola bar has done it . It tastes good , has great texture and chewy chocolate that is not dry tasting . I really enjoyed these bars but found that they were not available at my local supermarket .	1
For a product that is billed as a healtyh alternative , this cereal bar does a great job of filling you up while tasting good . Despite being a bit dry ( the only real complaint ) , this is a great choice to make during those stretch periods between meals . The bar is packed with vitamins and minerals ( 15 % of Vit A , Calcium , Iron ; 10 % of Phosphorus and Zinc ; 4 % of Vit C ; and a whopping 25 % of thiamin , riboflavin , niacin , Vit B6 and Vit B12 ; plus 30 % folate ) , making it a much more enjoyable source of them over supplements . You also get 16 % of your daily protein and 12 % of your fiber ! Sodium is not too high at 7 % , but if you 're not exercising you might be cautious of these having 10 % of your daily saturated fat value . It might not be as enjoyable as a granola bar , but it 's a much healthier alternative .	1
I like these even better than the chocolate version , very tasty peanut butter and moist and chewy . Great healthy snack .	1
These bars are perfect to stash in your purse for a meal on the go . They are absolutely more of a meal bar than a snack bar , they are filling and will keep you full for a few hours . The bars are soft but hold up well in a handbag or desk without turning to mush . They are sweet , chunky and satisfying . The bar is larger than average and it is chewy enough to keep you munching on it for awhile . The flavor is similar to a cinnamon roll . I really enjoy this bar !	1
Satisfying and full of yummy peanut butter flavor . My only complaint is with the texture -- a little like eating gravel . Do not worry about the diet label -- there is no diet medicine or supplement in this -- it is just a low cal cereal soy bar .	1
I really eat a lot of bars since I 'm on the go all the time and these are delicious . The peanut butter is especially tasty and filling and really tastes like peanut butter . I would definintely buy these again .	1
There are a lot of variations of the granola bar out there . Some are low fat , some high protein , some are high fiber , etc . This bar is a dark chocolate high fiber bar . There are 120 calories , 9g fiber , 6g sugar , and 3.5g fat . Frankly , for a fiber bar it had a very nice taste , not too far from a chocolate candy bar . If you are looking for a tasty bar with high fiber , this is good choice .	1
The bar is dense and chewy . There are 5 grams of fat per bar , of which 2 grams are saturated , and 160 mgs of sodium . The box says `` no artificial flavors or sweeteners . '' Despite this , the peanut butter taste , which was not strong , did seem artificial to me . A serving is one bar , and each bar has 140 calories . This is n't too bad since the bars are 1.23 oz , a decent size . I also tried the dark chocolate variety , which have fewer calories and less fat and sodium . I liked the dark chocolate ones better than these , but if you do n't care for dark chocolate , you might like these better . You will never mistake them for a Snickers , but they 're not bad for a cereal bar .	1
highly recommend this product . Great for a quick breakfast on the go , or a mid-afternoon energy boost . High protein also .	1
This snack bar is in an interesting mid-range between traditional high protein bars that taste like concrete and traditional granola/fiber bars that are sugar loaded with very little nutrition . Many lower carb , higher protein diet products contain sugar alcohols which cut down carbs but also can cause digestion problems . This fiber bar , although labeled `` South Beach '' is not nearly as low carb , high protein as some of their previous products , but also has not as artificial an ingredient list . It has a great taste and is filling .	1
These cereal bars , each containing 9 grams ( or 16 % of the RDA ) of protein , certainly live up to their billing as `` Protein Fit . '' They are also pretty tasty -- but , like most South Beach Diet products , they are rather dense . With a calorie count of 130 each ( and only 30 of those calories from fat ) , a carbohydrate content of just 17 grams ( or 6 % of the RDA ) , and a reasonable dose of many essential vitamins and minerals , these bars can easily fit into any reasonable calorie budget as a sensible , healthy snack . They 're individually wrapped , so they 're easy to take with you wherever you might be going . My only complaint , really , is that each box contains just 5 bars .	1
I like it that it has no carrageenan in the ingredients , I find the taste less then I had hoped . They are pretty good and I may get used to them , I liked the whipped peanut ones better but they have the carrageenan added . Not sure if I would recommend them at this time .	1
These bars are delicious ! My husband and I have started a diet program and these fit right in . The taste is delicious and the convenient size is great too .	1
When I was teaching my grandson to make cookies a couple of years ago , I shook in a mountain of cinnamon , after carefully adding measured quantities of nutmeg and ginger . He was curious and I replied , `` You can not have too much cinnamon . '' Well , these bars test that thesis.The dominant flavor is just that . Almost too much , but not quite . But the texture is good , the rest of the taste good , and the protein quantity for such a small bar with only 130 calories quite satisfactory.A nice addition to my meal substitute collection .	1
A friend of mine has been on my case to start eating a little healthier - specifically to have something for breakfast besides vitamins and orange juice - so I thought I would give these a try . I lost a lot of weight a few years ago by cutting way back on carbs so the South Beach brand gave me a little confidence that I was n't going to be eating a lot of useless carby stuff.I like this . The texture is pretty crunchy but not brittle , it 's not gummy like a Rice Krispies bar kind of thing , and the cinnamon flavor kind of jumps out at you in a good way . I normally equate the word `` spicy '' with `` hot '' but this is a non-hot kind of spicy that leaves enough impact that you can still taste the cinnamon for a while after you eat the bar . I 'm not sure if I 'll settle on this as my new breakfast regimen or not but I thought this was very good .	1
The South Beach Diet Dark Chocolate flavored granola bars are a nutritious snack . Made with natural whole grains and no artificial sweeteners or flavors , they are a perfect healthy snack choice . The dark chocolate flavor is not bitter . The texture is right in the middle , not too chewy and not too hard . The product contains 9 grams of fiber per serving which is 36 % of the RDA . Each bar contains only 120 calories , and is the perfect choice for a morning or afternoon pick-me-up snack . Overall , the great taste combined with good nutritional value make this a sweet tasting bar !	1
To be honest , I was a bit hesitant to try these . I had some other South Beach brand bars that were n't very good . But-I was pleasantly surprised by the Dark Chocolate fiber granola bars . They have a rice krispie like texture and a good , dark chocolate flavor.Each bar has 9 grams of fiber but 120 calories which is surprising for such a small bar . The list of ingredients shows a good amount of sugar . I wonder why they do n't use Stevia or agave instead since this is a `` health food '' type of snack . Also the protein in these are pretty low , only 6 grams . I think that could be a higher number as well . As a meal replacement-these would n't be enough . Having them in your purse or bag to stave off mid afternoon hunger pangs or low blood sugar - these are excellent !	1
As these things go , that is a `` diet '' bar , that is a snack bar that is supposed to be `` good for you , '' these are pretty good . The chocolate flavor is not overly processed or synthetic , there is a nice mix of crunch and chewy and , most importantly to me for these things - they are NOT mealy . I have no idea if they really help you lose weight as part of the SB diet , but if they do , all the better . No one will confuse these with actual baked goods , you know , like you 'd bake yourself or buy at the bakery , but there are a lot worse products out there on the shelf next to these .	1
I enjoyed the flavor of South Beach 's Cinnamon Raisin bar . Having tried several other brands of snack bars , it was nice to have one that is different . The taste was very good , but I honestly did not get the sense that there were any raisins in it . If I did n't see the bits scattered inside the bar , I would have thought it was more of a subtly flavored cinnamon snack . Regardless , it was certainly good enough to buy in the future .	1
I need to watch what I eat , so I l00k for high protein , low sugar snacks.The South Beach Diet Cinnemon Raisin bar delivers an acceptable level of protein , without a lot of fat . The frosting drizzle on top has the usual diet frosting artificial flavor , but I like the nutty cinnamon flavor of the bar underneath it .	1
Satisfies cravings for something sweet , something with chocolate and something with crunch all in one bar . Very tasty and no unpleasant aftertaste . Do n't know how `` fit '' they are , but still a great hunger-pain reducer .	1
This product , recently reconfigured is an improvement over the previous receipe . This version has diminished the cardboard texture of the earlier bar . A great grab and go morning bar .	1
These bars are a great way to help curb your appetite in between meals . And since they 're protein bars ( 9g= 17 % Daily Value ) they 're light on carbs ( 18g= 6 % Daily Value ) which wo n't weigh you down while still giving you a boost . They 're also largely soy-based , always a plus in any book . Good stuff .	1
These South Beach Choco-granolas are pretty much what you would expect from a diet bar . No where near as delicious as the good stuff , but hopefully containing a passable amount of flavor . Actually I gave these bars a little more credit for they are a nice cross between the usually dry and crunchy granola bars , and a chocolate brownie . If I was to criticize anything about them it is that they are still a little stiff and hard to chew for those with sensitive teeth , but the flavor is decent for something that is light and a lot better for us than the real thing . I particularly enjoy these bars with a cup of coffee . A warm mouth that is the result of eating them with something hot helps soften them a little for chewing , and in my opinion even helps them taste a little better . If you 're someone that has eaten these kinds of diet bars for a while now , it is my feeling you wo n't be disappointed in them . If you 're a new comer to them , do n't expect much of these , or any other of its kind for that matter ... In conclusion , these bars are at least as good and even better than many I have tried in the past . If you really do like them and plan to eat them regularly , you ca n't beat the deal of subscribing to them here on Amazon where you not only save money , but get free shipping at intervals of your choice as well . Recommended for the diet , health conscious snack crowd ... : )	1
Just the thing to grab and go when I do n't make time for a proper breakfast . They have a dark chocolate kind of taste , and go great with a cup of coffee . Not the breakfast of champions , but perfect for short on time dashers : ) .	1
South Beach Diet Bar Protein Fit Cereal Bar , Chocolate , 5-Count ( Pack of 8 ) What we have here is a very tasty snack bar . At 130 calories , it 's not the highest and not the lowest in that category . It is also of a size that can make for a nice on the go snack . It has a nice chocolaty taste and a good bite . It has just a bit of crunch but mostly a chewy texture . I think it tastes good . It has 8 sugars and 3 fibers and an assortment of added vitamins to make the calories not totally empty.Overall it 's a good snack with some added value in the nutrition department . I like it and can recommend it .	1
Wow.. these are good.These are chewy chocolate-goodness in a fairly healthy bar ! Each bar is a manageable 120 calories ( 30 from fat ) . The fiber content is 9G , the carbs are 22G and the protein is 6G.For people who use the `` Choose your foods : Exhange Lists for Diabetes , it is listed at 1 Carb ! 1 lean meat ( to be honest I do n't know what that means , but it may be of yuse to people who do.What I DO know is that these are VERY VERY good , the chocolate is a dark - not too sweet.. just the way I like it.It is chewy but not gummy , .. it is just a `` sinful tasting '' little break and treat.The only problem with the bars are that you will want to eat more than one ! Jim	1
How do you make protein palatable ? You load a bunch of sugar onto it . But do n't worry , I 'll still eat these like there 's no tomorrow . Good thing I 'm not 'on a diet ' . For those of you who are , you may want to invest in nature 's good to go bars : they 're called cucumbers.The flavor is reminiscent of the basic Quaker Oats bars that I used to eat in grade school and the only thing that 's changed , it seems , with this bar is the inflated price and the drizzle of sweet cinnamon topping . They 're tasty just like I remember them and they do have a good amount of protein ( 9 grams ) , but you 're going to need more than that and it 's not clear how this mixture of carbs and protein affects digestion . If the science in my diet is correct , these bars may be more magical than the magical fruit ( beans ) if you know what I mean.These are great for workout recovery or a pick-me-up before exercise . They 're probably too sweet any other time . Enjoy !	1
South beach varies widely in their offerings , but this particular bar ( South Beach Diet Bar Protein Fit Cereal Bar , Chocolate ) , is delicious . It is not brittle and dry as are some other varieties . The chocolate has a nice , rich taste , and the fat and carbs fight your immediate hunger very nicely , while the 9g of protein make it last . For only 130 calories , these really do the trick . The only downside is they are spendy if purchasing just one box at the store . But in bulk they are reasonably priced .	1
The overall flavor is good , but the texture is different from anything I 've experienced before , and I venture to attribute this to the chicory root fiber ; it seems `` woody '' in a way , but that does n't make me dislike it ... it 's just curiously different.Each thirty-five gram bar provides nine grams of protein . I 've been eating a bar just after I get up in the morning , and it does well to sustain me.The cinnamon and raisin bars are lightly drizzled with frosting , they are free of artificial flavors and sweeteners , and they are satisfyingly good . These bars do leave an aftertaste , though not unpleasant . These are , actually , quite yummy .	1
A little gooey which kind of puts me off a little ... a little more crunch would be more natural and tasty in my opinion . They are good though and I was surprised since health foods usually are n't all that tasty . Great for sticking in your purse or pocket and eating when you need a quick snack .	1
Whether you are picking the kids up at school or on the run from the law , your day is busy and you do n't have time to prepare a healthy , filling , nutritious snack to fill you up between meals . These little bars are great for those busy times.I really like the taste of these snack bars . They are very cinnamony , and I noticed that flavor much more than the raisins . The texture of the first bite really surprised me . They have an almost gritty feel to them , perhaps because of all the fiber . Although that first bite was a little surprising , I did n't find the texture objectionable . These bars have only 3 grams of fat , but two-thirds of that is saturated fat . For 130 calories , they do feel quite filling.These are a convenient snack to keep in a purse or your car . However , for those first starting on the South Beach diet , it is not obvious that you can not have these bars until phases 2 and 3 . There is a little notice on the side of the box that is is for those phases , but that notice is at the very bottom and quite small.They do contain palm kernel oil , and I am not a fan of that.These make a nice snack for someone following South Beach or something similar , and I love their convenience , but I would n't make them a daily treat .	1
South Beach Diet 's CHOCOLATE PROTEIN FIT bars are chocolaty , chewy , and crunchy all at the same time . That 's a good thing , especially for those of us who are dieting and really miss our snacks ! I found the chocolate flavor to be fairly intense - it has a very nice creamy dark chocolate taste that mixes nicely with the whole grain cereal crunch.Health-wise , the South Beach bars have more protein than comparable Atkins bars , but less fiber . As a comparison , the South Beach CHOCOLATE PROTEIN bars have 9 grams of protein , 3 grams of fiber , and 130 calories . TheAtkins Day Break , Chocolate Hazelnut Bar , 1.40 oz Bars , 5 count box ( pack of 2 ) have 6 grams of protein , 7 grams of fiber , and 180 calories . If you 're watching fat consumption , the South Beach bars are definitely the better choice - the CHOCOLATE PROTEIN bars have only 3.5 grams of fat , while the Atkins bars have 14 grams . The South Beach bars do have almost twice the sodium content as the Atkins bars , so keep that in mind if you 're watching sodium intake . I found the taste of the two bars to be comparable , although I would describe the South Beach bars as more chocolaty.Overall , the South Beach CHOCOLATE PROTEIN bars are a good choice for dieters looking for a tasty low-fat treat that offers some definite health benefits . There 's also a 55 cent coupon printed on the inside of the box !	1
I was surprised that , to my taste anyway , these bars are quite good . I liked them so much , in fact , that I ordered some more for myself after taste testing them through the Vine program . I like chocolate , but I do n't always eat it ( other than as low-sugar , dark chocolate ) because it has a lot of calories . This bar satisfies chocolate cravings for me with relatively low calories , and it also has protein in it to keep blood sugar even.The ingredients of this bar are n't organic like theClif Bar , which is , or was , my favorite meal bar . However this bar is less condensed than the Clif bar . That means that for the same calories as in a Clif bar ( which is 240 calories ) , you can eat two of these bars ( if you subtract out the calories for the fiber it has , the net calories are only about 115 ) . These bars also are much less expensive than Clif bars . They sell for around 50 cents each in most places , so two of them , the same weight as a single Clif bar , costs about 2/3 the price of a Clif bar , and there is a lot more volume to it , so you get to chew more . These bars also have almost twice the protein per weight as a Clif bar.Update 11/15/12 : I got received the order I placed for these bars which I purchased myself . Interestingly , they were much more soft and chewy than the free sample I got from Vine , which is a texture I really like in a meal bar . Either the Vine samples were old and stale or they 've improved the formula . Whatever the case may be , I like the new batch I got even more than the previous ones I tasted .	1
I received a pack and shared it with 4 co-workers . Everyone liked it . It had a nice taste , kind of like peanut butter and rice crispies . It was not too much PB and not too little . It was a nice mid-day snack and a nice addition to the lunch box .	1
These are very filling , savory snacks and I am glad they have them on such a good deal on Amazon . Of course you ca n't let them get above room temperature as the peanut butter topping will get stuck to the wrapping.. but hey , when you 're counting calories sometimes being able to lick the wrapper is very satisfying !	1
I have always enjoyed any bars that the South Beach folks make , so I knew that I would like these especially well . Peanut butter is my very favorite flavor , and I appreciate that it is NOT combined with chocolate in these bars ! I love them - they are wonderful for me to grab in the morning when I leave for work at 6:30 a.m. and do n't have time to make breakfast . They are crunchy but also have the very pleasantly-textured creamy peanut butter drizzle on top . One bar holds me well until my early 10 a.m. lunch . Very nice !	1
These South Beach Diet Protein bars are super chocolatey . It reminded me of a fudge brownie when I first bit into it . For a little bar it 's also quite filling . Usually the last bite I 'm ready to toss it . If you 're a chocolate lover , these will definately satisfy your chocolate craving . It 's a great snack to reach for in between meals .	1
The South Beach Diet Bar ( Dark Chocolate ) offer a tasty but relatively healthy treat . It has a rich though not overly sweet taste and is fiber rich while low on calories . Do n't expect it to taste like candy - this is a granola bar , after all - but it does offer a rare treat for those trying to lose weight . While the heavier fiber intake may make it a little bit of an acquired taste , the chocolate makes it a lot easier to acquire . If the rest of losing weight could only be this easy !	1
This is the very best way I 've ever found to get extra fiber in my diet . If you like dark chocolate , you 'll be in heaven with these . I buy them on the Subscribe and Save plan and get them for under $ 0.50 apiece ! They 're my healthy candy bars . Num num !	1
Yes , that 's right , I was n't expecting much from these bars . I 've never tried a South Beach diet food , mainly because I do n't follow the South Beach diet ( or any diet , for that matter ) , but I was curious about these . After all , they are chocolate , or at least chocolate-flavored , and you have to work really hard to go wrong with chocolate . After the first bite , I was pleasantly surprised at how good these fiber bars managed to be.The first thing I noticed was that there was no weird , chemical-y aftertaste , which is often the biggest issue with chocolate-flavored snack foods . It 's also not bitter , which is yet another obstacle to snack foods when they use dark instead of milk chocolate . In fact , the chocolate flavor is rather good , not quite a-dessert-I'd-give-my-eyeteeth-for good , but respectable , and there 's quite a bit of it . The bottom of the bar is coated in a solid layer , it 's in the bar itself , and , of course , there 's the lovely chocolate drizzle across the top . The texture is chewy enough to be satisfying without making your jaw fall off from the effort of getting through the bar , and it 's also got some crunch to it from the soy and whole wheat crisps . The one negative I have about the texture is that it 's rather ... not dry , but mealy , perhaps . I think it could be slightly moister.Each bar offers up 9 grams of fiber and 6 grams of protein , which you may already know from looking at the box ; what you may not know is that the bars also have only 6 grams of sugar , a respectably low number . Sugar content is something else that should be noted when looking for a healthy snack , but is often overlooked in favor of things like fat and calorie content . Speaking of which , each bar has 120 calories , with 3.5 grams of total far ( 2 grams of that saturated fat , which is n't the greatest ratio , but it 's doable ) . The ingredient list is fairly short and is n't stuffed with unpronounceable , multisyllabic words , which is always a good thing in my book.Eating one of these bars wo n't fill you up , but it will stave off any unnecessary snacking , plus it 'll satisfy your sweet tooth in a way that wo n't derail your diet plan , so they get a big thumbs up .	1
I picked these up on a special and was a bit skeptical about them . I have found they are an excellent alternative for when I get that & # 34 ; candy bar & # 34 ; craving . These are quite solid , so you actually feel like you are eating ( unlike similar bars I 've tried ) . Eating with a glass of water , and the fiber swells up and I feel very satisfied for an extended period of time . The flavor is very & # 34 ; dense & # 34 ; -- I 'm not sure how to describe it . I can taste the chocolate in every bite , and there is no question that I 've eaten something when finished . I have also found that because they are so solid , they can take quite a beating in my lunch bag or purse and remain about the same ( not a bag of crumbles ) .	1
I wish I could find these at the local Food Lion . I limited myself to one every other day so as to extend the taste experience . This is NOT diet food . It simply tastes too good .	1
When it comes to low glycemic bars , I 've tried them all , and I 'm always on the lookout for something with a true chocolate flavor . So many low cal/diet snacks sacrifice dark chocolate richness with bars with the taste and texture of used coffee grounds sprinkled with the world 's worst sweetener . These fiber bars are a pleasant surprise -- very good , very true dark chocolate flavor . And they are the right amount of moist . Thumbs up !	1
I really enjoy this little cereal bar . Usually , especially when it comes to peanut butter , I am very picky . I do n't like that `` fake '' taste that many food products tend to have . However , this protein bar really tastes of `` real '' peanut butter , but the taste is not so overpowering , it 's as if you are eating pure peanut butter . The combination of peanut butter and the cereal/grain is just perfect and the crunch is not overly crunchy to the point it has become crispy , but yet it is not so soft and smooshy that the texture resembles that of nougat in a candy bar . The texture has a great balance , and between the `` grain '' for the base of the bar and the peanut butter flavour , it combines it to a distinguished but not overly powerful flavour so as to turn the Consumer ( no pun intended ) off . The size is n't tiny and compact , yet is not overly large and seemingly daunting . I feel it is just right as a nice `` grab and go '' kind of nutritional bar that has quite the enjoyable taste and is just the right size . I would comment , though , that this is a bar I 'd probably get again , but I would n't eat more than one for a single sitting , nor would it be something I 'd want to eat everyday - to me , especially for this kind of product , either the taste or the texture would get `` old '' and it would become less enjoyable .	1
These South Beach Protein bars are great for someone like me , who tends to skip breakfast and be so busy at work that I tend to `` forget '' to take a lunch break . They have a lot of protein , so I can grab one on the go and know I am getting some form of nutrition . I usually buy bars that are a bit lower in calories ( these are 140 ) but they satisfy my hunger and tide me over till I can get a proper meal . The peanut butter flavor is so good !	1
At only 130 calories , this is a delicious snack . Somewhat chewy with a very slight crunch , it tastes a lot like a cinnamon roll . I was actually quite surprised by how good it tastes . It has 15-30 % of the daily allowance of several vitamins and minerals . Being a good source of both fiber and protein , it 's a filling snack that will hit the spot and satisfy sweet cravings .	1
These are really rather good -- dense dark chocolate flavor , nice `` mouth feel '' ( crunchy , chewy ) . Nice high-fiber count , too.I 'm on Weight Watchers , and the calculator totals these at 3 points each . They 're 120 calories -- similar to a lot of `` diet ' snacks -- but the difference is in the amount of fiber.There 's a slightly `` chalky '' taste to them ( maybe due to the chicory listed as one of the main ingredients ) that I 'm not wild about -- but if you 're looking for a high-fiber chocolatey snack , these might fill the bill .	1
These diet bars have a rich dark chocolate taste but they 're a little gritty ( too much sugar ) ? I think the most important aspect of any diet product , if it 's palatable and these are , is whether or not they 're filling . These do fill the void , but with so much fiber you can expect a gassy side effect . They 're kind of like drinking Slim Fast which many people refer to as gas in a can , but that 's the sacrifice we dieters have to make to lose weight . They 're great if you get up late and can not wait to cook a plate !	1
I 've decided to eat these instead of candy bars or cookies as an afternoon snack . I think they taste much better and I know they are healthier . Only 120 calories , 9 grams of fiber and 6 grams of protein . Both protein and fiber help me feel fuller longer without the energy dip of simple sugar.The Dark Chocolate South Beach bar tastes like an Oreo type dark chocolate cookie to me , without the greasy sandwich filling . I 'm one of the weird people who scrape the filling off and discard it . To me this bar is THE BEST part of the cookie.South Beach is a quality , dependable product line . I 'll definitely buy them again .	1
I decided to try this product for the reviews I read said it tasted like a crunchy , sweet , chocolate bar . Well it does smell like a brownie but this taste like no brownie I have ever had from home made or any bakery . But as a crunch chocolate protein supplement for breakfast it is good . This bar is for someone who wishes to carry a easily transported meal supplement/replacement . Each bar is 130 calories and does have the reported 9g of protein , 3 g of Fiber as well of 17g of Carbohydrates ; 8g of those carbohydrates being in the form of sugar . This accurately belongs in the cereal bar category .	1
I did n't expect to like the south beach diet products as much as I did but after trying these peanut butter variety , I 'm going to purchase more ! I loved the taste , the crunch and the way t filled me up . Totally beat out the Special K diet bars for me ! !	1
When I first got my hands on the the box of fiber bars , I was feeling ready for a nice pre-lunch snack . I took one bite and was pleasantly surprised at how much I enjoyed them . The texture reminds be a bit of the rice crispy treats , chewy , with a little crunch . There 's no artificial flavors or sweeteners , which is probably why they taste so good . With 9 grams of fiber and 6 grams of protein , I was left feeling satisfied . I did n't have the hunger pangs nor did I feel bad like I would with many other high fat , sugar treats . At $ 27.00 for 40 bars , the price is n't bad either . About the same as you 'd pay for a regular candy bar . Now I will say that a nice piece of pie , cake , donut , or candy bar would be a bit tastier , but not by that much . With the extra taste of the fatty , sugary treats , there 's always the , why did I eat that , now I feel like s $ % ^ $ # .I feel like I 'm missing out without some sort of sweet treat . These bars , are a nice way to satisfy those cravings .	1
I think they are self-defeating in that they taste so good I wanted more than one - in fact I just atee the entire box one after the other- so not slimming for me , a man of little restraint	1
One word : YUM ! These diet bars taste fantastic . The texture is amazing , not crumbly or hard , just nice and chewy . The taste is delicious . I was expecting a little bit of that powdery 'diet ' taste , but there is none to be found with these.I was satisfied until dinner , and the calorie count is just right for my afternoon snack.The only stopping me from stocking up point is that there is only 5 in a box . It 's a little steep price-wise for a daily snack . For a treat though , I 'm happily picking up a box here and there .	1
The South Beach Diet Bars ( Dark Chocolate - Pack of 8 ) are so delicious , it does n't taste like a diet bar . If you have a sweet tooth , I highly recommend these bars as a dessert . Just try not to eat the entire box in one sitting . At $ 27.36 ( as of today ) for a pack of eight 5-count boxes , each bar comes to approximately $ 1.35 . This is a lot less expensive than most desserts and much healthier . Highly recommended .	1
I liked these for a quick on the go breakfast or snack . There are 9g of protein , only 130 calories and are yummy . To be honest I did not taste the cinnamonny goodness until the second bite , but then I tasted a cinnamon raisin roll without all the calories.Recommend for a high protein , low calorie on the go snack or breakfast .	1
The product leaves a slight metallic after taste which I guess might be from the pyridoxine and the zinc oxide . At first there is a slight peanut butter and cane syrup taste and then one feels the rolled oats pieces . This does not linger for long and then one is left with the metallic taste.It wo n't be an addiction product that is for sure . It is not like sweet candy which compels one to eat more and more . It does have that diet cut-off mood .	1
These bars have a nice , chocolate taste that is not too overpowering , and is not too `` hard '' or too difficult to chew as some of these types of bars can be on occasion . While consisting of just 130 calories , there does seem to be a lot of saturated fat at 2 grams or 10 % of the recommended daily allowances . Overall , very tasty and I would consider these again in a future purchase .	1
I buy granola bars of all kinds and types , trying to find any that taste good , do n't taste like cardboard and are n't so small you need to eat 3 or 4 . I was leery of these South Beach Fiber bars , but have to save I was surprised at the flavor . the bottom of the bar is solid chocolate , with some chocolate drizzled on top , and the chocolate flavor is very good , it does n't taste pasty or chalky like some other diet bars I have tried . In my opinion , kids would even eat these , they are that good ! I would buy these again and recommend them .	1
I 've tried a lot of protein bars and this one ranks up there . The peanut butter flavor is nice , and best of all , there is no unpleasant atertaste . That 's the real issue with most of this type of product , and this one does pretty well in my book . The only thing negative I can say is the bar is actually much smaller than I expected , even though it did hit the spot when I needed the snack . Yum !	1
The front of the box says , Improved Taste . I do n't know how it did taste , but the new and improved taste is good , almost as good as a candy bar.In fact , it tastes so sweet I thought it would have a lot of sugar , but was surprised to see it only has 7 grams of sugar , and no artificial sweeteners.You will not be disappointed by this bar .	1
I 'm not a big fan of Protein Bars but found this one far better than most . I 'm not a breakfast fan and now that I 'm at an age where I have to watch my diet and surrender to doctors ' orders I 've been using Protein Bars for that first meal of this day . The South Beach Protein Fit Cereal Bar surprised me in that it was n't a chore to eat it ; in fact I liked it . I know this is n't much of a testimonial but I figure if I like it , those who are into this type of meal replacement will probably be very happy . The chocolate flavor was real tasting and very chocolaty . I was reminded of Rice Krispy treats which are a favorite of mine.If you 're like me and do n't purchase this type of meal replacement or snack give them a try . I was pleasantly surprised .	1
The South Beach Diet Protien Fit Cinnamon Ceral Bars provide a grat addition for meals on the go . These protien bars are great tasting and are great with milk , juice a cup of coffe to provide a great meal on the go . Good nutrition , convience , great tasting are just what busy people are looking for . These bars are really great to have on hand .	1
To be perfectly honest , I was n't really expecting much from these South Beach granola bars . I 've generally found most granola bars to be in the `` OK-tasting , keeps you full for less time than necessary '' category . I ended up being really surprised at how much I like these . First of all , they taste really good - almost just like a chocolate bar . Second of all , with 9 grams of fiber , they kept me full for a few hours , which is all I needed for the days when I missed breakfast or needed an afternoon snack . Additionally , they are the perfect size to fit in a small purse . Recommended for anyone that is looking for a filling , great-tasting snack .	1
These bars have a pretty good flavor for a fiber granola bar . They pack a chocolate punch and a nice crunch to them , and do a decent job of filling you up if you 're looking for a sweet snack to tide you over between meals . I also like the fact that there 's no artificial sweeteners in these bars , something I need to avoid .	1
As they say on the South Beach Diet web site , `` The best choice for a healthy meal or a healthy snack is always whole food . But , sometimes our schedules are just too busy and we do n't have time to prepare a meal or snack . '' What to do then ? These cereal bars are tasty with a nice flavor of cinnamon and raisin . With 9 grams of protein and 3 grams of fiber to 8 grams of sugar and only 130 calories , they offer a much healthier snack option than the typical vending machine choices or even a lot of other diet products.I have successfully used the South Beach Diet over the past few years to loose weight , to lower my blood sugar , and to improve my cholesterol and I have incorporated its principles into the way that I eat all year long.Like some other programs , the South Beach Diet encourages morning and afternoon snacks and allows a dessert in the evening . These diet bars are a good choice for anyone on such a program , or really for anyone who just feels like having a healthy and tasty snack or light dessert from time to time.In the same family of products , I like even betterSouth Beach Diet Bar Fiber Granola Bar , Dark Chocolate , 5-Count ( Pack of 8 ) . I find them even more tasty . Plus , they have a little less sugar , a bit more fiber , and even a few less calories .	1
For `` diet '' snack bars , these taste the best ! They are filling , delicious and are a good source of fiber . These bars taste the best out of many of the others out there -- To me , they blow away slim fast bars ! Great item for those who love chocolate yet want to watch what they eat !	1
Sometimes work is too hectic to take my lunch when I 'm actually hungry , so I like to keep bars like the South Beach ones on hand to keep me going until I can have lunch . But which ones provide the best nutrition as well as flavor ? The chocolate flavored Protein Fit Cereal Bar from South Beach definitely gets the taste right and I liked the texture of the bar with its rolled oats and drizzled chocolate . With the question of flavor answered , I looked into the nutritional value . Since the numbers on their own do n't mean much to me , I compared the South Beach to another bar I had which was the Kid Clif Bar in the chocolate brownie flavor . The Clif bars are slightly bigger at 1.27oz versus the 1.23oz of the South Beach , but both bars are 130 calories . The South Beach has 30mg more sodium . In terms of nutrients , the South Beach does better in some areas ( Vitamins A , B2 , and B12 ) while the Clif is better in others ( Vitamin C and B1 plus Calcium ) . So in all , it 's a bar I will add to my list .	1
I like protein bars because , as someone on the go a lot , I do n't always get a proper meal , and a good protein bar can fill you up while still being easy to take with you.These bars do the trick pretty good , while having the pleasant surprise of tasting like a cereal bar . Imagine a Coco-Krispies bar and you 're in the ballpark.Tasty stuff , and they do n't have as severe a protein aftertaste the way some bars do . Not a bad product !	1
It is hard to find an energy bar that has a low sugar content . These have less than one-quarter sugar , while still delivering nine grams of protein . Most comparable bars contain thirty to forty percent sugar . In addition , the contents are all natural.These bars have at nice taste that is not overwhelmed by sweetness . I give these bars my vote for five stars .	1
I love to eat healthy . With so much fiber ( 9 gram ) in a low calories ( 120 ) package , I do n't feel guilty having this delicious dark chocolate bar . It is chewy because of the fiber . It will serve as a great afternoon snack or grab-n-run breakfast alternative .	1
I have reached that stage of life where the dietary fiber content in the food I consume is an important consideration . Let 's just say it would be `` irregular '' of me to explain why . I 'm also trying to keep my weight under control , so calories are a factor as well . These Dark Chocolate Granola Bars are , for me , outstanding on both counts.Let 's compare with the gold standard for dietary fiber , Metamucil . If you do n't want artificial sweeteners , one dose of Metamucil Orange Flavor will give you 3 grams of fiber at a cost of 45 calories . These South Beach Bars will give you 9 grams of fiber for 120 calories . Do the math , and they are almost equivalent in terms of fiber per calorie , and the Granola Bars taste a lot better than the Metamucil . They have a nice chocolatey flavor and a good granola chewiness.They have `` No artificial flavors or sweeteners , '' and are made with , `` Natural Whole Grains . '' However , a word of caution here about ingredients : They contain Chicory Root Extract , also known as Inulin . Although I am not one , I know that there are folks whose digestive systems can not process Inulin . If you are such an individual , these bars are probably not for you . The remaining components look fine to me , with the rest of the fiber coming from Soluble Corn Fiber and Whole Grain Wheat . They contain 3.5 grams of fat , 2 of which are saturated fat . 100 mg of Sodium and 22 grams of carbs along with 6 grams of protein.I do n't really want 40 of these in my pantry , but if I see individual boxes of them in the store at a more or less comparable price , I will buy them .	1
These are VERY good choco-granola bars , definitely tasting of dark chocolate , not bitter or weird-tasting ( definitely NOT carob ! ! ! ) They 're nicely crunchy and decently chewy . One , alongside the morning coffee , fills me right up ! They taste better than a LOT of non-diet granola bars I 've had , plus you get 9 grams of fiber per 'serving , ' as well as 6 grams of protein ( and 3.5 grams of fat . ) Supposedly it 's 120 calories per bar , which is apparently pretty good for chocolate granola bars . I 'm not actually watching my weight , but apparently Weight Watchers gives them a 3-count , so I would STRONGLY recommend them if you 're looking for good taste with nutrition balanced against calories .	1
You know I was really sceptical that these would taste good . In my experience anything with diet on it is pretty disgusting . These peanut butter bars are yummy ! Many times I get in a hurry and ca n't stop to eat so I have tried many protien bars . These are only 140 calories and are moist and tasty . They kept me going for six hours the other day when I was too busy to eat . I would heartily recommend them .	1
The South Beach Chocolate Protein Cereal Bars are pretty tasty , and with 9 grams of protein and 3 grams of fiber , a pretty good choice for a snack . There are 8 grams of sugar , but only 130 calories per bar . I thought they tasted good , had a nice chewy constancy , although a little dry . They are great with a glass of milk ! I carried them with me for a quick snack between meals , and I found they curbed my hunger longer than other snacks . I would buy these to have something to easily carry with me that would satisfy my sweet tooth , as well as tide me over to meal time .	1
I 've beeen having a protein bar for breakfast almost every day for about two years . My bar of choice is the Medifast Peanut Butter Crunch . It has 10 grams of protein and 110 calories as compared to 9 grams of protein and 130 calories for this . That 's not a significant difference and I 'm not certain of the price of these but they 're probably less . Nonetheless , I 'm a Medifast ( Take Shape for Life ) distributor so that will remain my bar of choice and it 's a great plan to lose weight . I lost 60 pounds in 2011 . If you 're interested in the Take Shape for Life weight loss program you may find information about it at island dot tsfl dotcom ( dots without the spaces of course ) .Anyway , these are very tasty and I think is a handy high protein snack bar that 's conveient to carry around with you .	1
Holds together well slightly crunchy with a nice sweet molassis flavor . I like the taste of these & may order more after this box runs out . Good flavor on this close to A+ item .	1
I have tried a variety of cereal and granola bars and these are one of the better ones . The taste was pretty good and the calorie and carbohydrate amounts , compared to the size of the bars , was good as well.I have tried a number of different diet cereal/granola bars made by different companies . The problem is many of them are really small . These cereal bars have 130 calories but are big enough to be a good snack size.Each bar has 130 calories , three grams of fat , 18 carbohydrates and 3 grams of fiber . As someone who counts carbohydrates these numbers are comparable to many of the 90 calories bars but these bars are bigger . More importantly you get 9 grams of protein and a good amount of vitamins and minerals . Plus there are no artificial sweeteners.Taste is subjective . I thought the taste of the bars were pretty good . I tasted the cinnamon and raisins . I was not crazy about the glaze . It was not as sweet as a sugary glaze but at the same time it seemed to overpower the cinnamon flavor . I would love to try these with no glaze and more cinnamon or with a sweeter glaze that brought out the flavor of the cinnamon.For me there are better tasting cereal and granola bars on the market but these still have a pretty good flavor . I do n't think there are many bars that are this size and which have such low amounts of carbohydrates and high amounts of protein . If the cinnamon flavor could be heightened a bit more these would be perfect .	1
These are the perfect tasty peanut in-between snack to stave off hunger.They do n't have an aftertaste.They are filling.The texture is moist , not dry.They taste like peanut butter ! Calories : 140 ; Fat 5g ; Protein 9g ; Fiber 3g ; Carbs 16gNo artificial sweeteners or flavorsMy box has a .55 cent coupon printed on the inside cartoon.They have become a regular at my house .	1
The first thing you notice when you unwrap the foil on this cereal bar is that it smells strongly of cinnamon and raisin . This is a very encouraging start . It also looks to be very , very dense with bits of cereal grains ( actually soy protein nuggets ) packed tightly together and bound by what looks like a sugary base ( partially composed of tapioca syrup ) . Given the appearance , it 's surprising that the first few bites are n't incredibly sweet . In fact , at first , this is a little bland , but , as is often the case , the flavor picks up momentum with subsequent bites . It becomes sweeter and the cinnamon flavor builds up . There are also enough raisins that you can actually taste them without going overboard . A few bites in , this is reminiscent of the flavor ( although certainly not the texture ) of a cinnamon bun . It does , of course , carry some of the artificial aftertaste of being a processed food ( likely from the plastic packaging ) . This is not an oppressive flavor , but it is present and should be noted.Though it looks dense and one might expect it to be hard , it 's actually easy to bite into and just a tiny bit chewy . It does not stick to the teeth however . It is actually pretty pleasant from a textural viewpoint as it is neither too soft nor too hard . As protein bars go , it 's not the best I 've ever had , but it 's certainly good and the calorie count is pretty low at only 130 calories.The ingredients list does include fructose ( though not `` high fructose corn syrup '' ) as well as sugar . It has 9 grams of protein , which is great , but also has 3 grams of fat , 8 grams of sugars and 18 grams of carbohydrate . This is offset somewhat by having 3 grams of fiber.I 'm not a big fan of bar food . In fact , I cook almost everything I eat from scratch from bread to soup to entrees , but I do sometimes have issues with low blood sugar when I go for a long time without eating ( such as when I 'm outside the house doing business or in the car ) and like to keep protein bars in my bag as a stop-gap measure . It beats eating fast food , but is n't better than whole food , of course . My favorite bar for this has always been one of the Nu-Go protein bars , but they are harder to find and have more calories per bar at 170-180 each . This is lighter , and quite serviceable . If you need something on the go , this is a very palatable choice .	1
Good Protein / Fiber / Carbs profile ... low calories ... small portion sizeThese bars have a good Protein / Fiber / Carbs profile9g of protein means they are 26 % protein . Carbs ( bad ) - Protein ( good ) - Fiber ( good ) = 6.This is quite a good profile for a bar that does not use sugar substitutes ( such as sugar alcohols ) It is not as good in this profile as say a KIND PLUS , Almond Walnut Macadamia + Protein , but is better than others such as most Zone Perfect bars or a Zing Almond BlueberryThis bar has a low calorie count . The portion size at 50g is on par with Zone and Larabar perfect , and actually bigger than Kind , but less than others ThinkThin and 20/20 lifestyles .	1
South Beach really rocks when it comes to flavor . They produce bars and snacks that taste wonderfully rich and decadent , not cardboardy or bland at all . This is another great product of theirs -- it 's yummy and a satisfying snack size while being full of fiber . A terrific pick me up or lunch 'dessert ' .	1
I liked these cereal bars , as did by husband and three kids . The drizzled icing is tasty , with a hint of cinnamon , and the raisins are sweet and not overdone . I found one bar to be very filling as an afternoon snack , and I think they would be sufficient for breakfast . I 'll probably buy them in the future , though I prefer less processed foods ( i.e . items that do n't come prepackaged in a box ) .Each box contains 5 bars , and currently Amazon is selling these in packs of 8 boxes . The current price is lower per box than my local grocery stores in Raleigh , NC , but you have to really like these to order 40 bars ! You 'd probably be safest to buy one box at the store , try it out , and then order bulk on Amazon if you love them enough to have a bunch.Info from the box : Nutritional facts per bar ( 35g ) : 130 calories , 30 calories from fat , 3g total fat ( 5 % daily value , based on a 2,000 calorie diet ) , 2g saturated fat ( 10 % ) , less than 5mg cholesterol ( 1 % ) , 160mg sodium ( 7 % ) , 80mg potassium ( 2 % ) , 18g total carbs ( 6 % ) , 3g dietary fiber ( 12 % ) , 8g sugar , 9g protein ( 17 % ) .Vitamins and minerals : Vitamin A 15 % RDA , Calcium 15 % , Thiamin 25 % , Niacin 25 % , Phosphorus 10 % , Vitamin C 4 % , Iron 15 % , Riboflavin 25 % , Vitamin B6 25 % , Vitamin B12 25 % , and Zinc 10 % .Ingredients : Soy Protein Nuggets ( Soy Protein Isolate , Tapioca , Starch , Salt ) , Tapioca Syrup , Rolled Oats , Raisins , Chicory Root Fiber , Sugar , Fructose , Fractionated Palm Kernel Oil , Butter ( Cream , Salt ) , Nonfat Milk , Maltodextrin , Cinnamon , Calcium Carbonate , Natural Flavor , Soy Lecithin , Nonfat Yogurt Powder ( Cultured Nonfat Milk ) , Salt , Dextrose , Caramel Added for Color , Stevia Extract , Niacinamide , Ferric Orthophosphate , Ascorbic Acid , Zinc Oxide , Pyroxine , Hydrochloride , Riboflavin , Thiamine Mononitrate , Vitamin A Acetate , Folic Acid , Vitamin B12.Allergen info : Contains milk , soybean .

I like the South Beach peanut butter bars . I 've been eating them for a while . There are good things and bad things about these , so I 'll break it down like that.GoodOnly 140 calories ( the old bars I used to find were more , I think those were just 'meal bars ' ) High protein -- I can tell a big difference in my energy levelHigh fiberEasy and convenientBadThese do n't taste as good as the old onesThey are very grittyAll in all , if you are are looking for a healthy breakfast meal option that is high in protein , low in calories , and convenient , then this is a really good one . I just wish they were n't as gritty .	1
We really enjoyed the South Beach Diet Bar . The chocolate flavor was delicious and enjoyed knowing the nutrition was in keeping with controlling unwanted calories .	1
I 've tried lots of protein bars before , and most tasted horribly chalky , or bland , or just plain awful . And the few that tasted good were usually good because they had a lot of fat and/or sugar ( mmmm ) ... But these , in my opinion , seem to strike a decent balance ; they taste pretty good , without relying on a lot of sugar & fat . Yes , of course , they 're not going to taste like a candy bar , or a typical cereal bar , but that 's not their intention . For me , someone with a deadly sweet tooth , I could eat one of these instead of a candy bar , and it would satisfy my chocolate craving , without all the fat & garbage , while also giving me lots of the good stuff , like protein , fiber , vitamins & minerals ... And if I were to buy these from Amazon , using S & S , it would cost about $ 0.57/bar , and that 's definitely reasonable .	1
A thin layer of peanut butter serves as the `` icing '' on this crunchy bar . I do n't care for the little bit of mess that makes on my fingers when holding it , but it 's such a thin layer , it really is n't that much of a bother.The texture overall is similar to that of a very compact crispy rice bar . The flavor is not as sweet as a crispy rice bar , of course . Overall the flavor is not overwhelming , and makes for a good snack .	1
These are crunchy in a sugar wafer kind of way , almost like a & # 34 ; kit-kat & # 34 ; . They are very good , perfect for a pre-exercise snack .	1
I love nutrition bars and have tried almost all brands . This is one of my favorites and I am glad to see it on Amazon because no local stores in my area carry this flavor any longer . The is a cereal bar with added protein and fiber which helps you feel fuller longer . It is designed to fit into the South Beach Diet program from the book of the same name . This diet is like the Adkins diet with a healthy twist focusing on leaner protein sources and healthier fats while reducing carbohydrates on the diet program . I have lost weight on similiar type programs . This bar was my go to breakfast for years for its low calorie count and ability to fill me up . I always liked the flavor also , to me it is like a Cocoa Krispies treat with a drizzle of chocolate on top . While it is more dense than a Krispie Treat and less sweet , I really like it . Great for breakfast or late afternoon snacks !	1
My wife , who limits her gluten , is very impressed with this product . Interestingly enough , she does not like dark chocolate but she does like these . Dark chocolate is one of my favorites and these bars provide a rich chocolate flavor with healthy whole grains . Personally , I am not a fan of the texture but the flavor is good enough to overcome that dislike . It is surprisingly tasty for a low-carb diet snack .	1
I was very pleased to find out that these bars are made withoutSplenda or NutraSweet . The ingredients are much healthier thanthose found in Atkins bars , in my opinion . They are low incalories and high on taste . This is a product that I woulddefinitely purchase again . The chocolate flavor is intenseand satisfying .	1
Dark chocolate taste is delicious , satisfying and not sweet.Nutrition as per the nutrition panel is good.This is not a sweet , sticky granola bar as many tend to be.I 'm more of a milk chocolate lover but this bar was very good .	1
South Beach Diet Cinnamon Raisin Protein Bars have a pleasantly sweet flavor and a not-too-chewy texture ( kind of like rice crispy treats without the stickiness ) . They 're healthful , containing 17 percent of your recommended daily protein needs and 12 percent of your fiber allowance with less than 25 percent of calories from fat . Relatively low in sugar and fat compared to other bars , such as Balance and Luna , they do n't have enough crunch or enough raisins for my taste , but otherwise they 're a good choice for judicious snacking .	1
These bars with 9 grams of protein make a good snack or even a light meal . And , unlike some other protein bars , they taste good . Each bar looks like a brownie and tastes almost as good as real brownie . ( Of course , if they tasted just as good as real brownies , some dieters would be tempted to binge on them . ) There is a nice streusel decoration on top . And the bar has an interesting crunch in addition to the cake-like texture of a real brownie .	1
These taste pretty good ! I do n't know if I 'd call them a health food though . But if you 're dieting and craving chocolate , these would work . They 're chocolatey and crispy !	1
I have to admit that I did not expect much from these bars . I have had so many similar products over the years that my expectations are pretty low . Without a doubt I was amazingly surprised by the taste of these bars . They actually have a real fudge taste . I could not believe that they were `` diet bars . '' Now , make no mistake about it , these are not really `` low '' in calories , but as a quick snack , they will not break your caloric bank either . Just do n't think you are going to be able to eat a bunch at one sitting . For a snack like this , taste is the most important thing , and thee bars are some of the best out there . You will not be disappointed .	1
Great tasting snack bar with 9 grams of protein with only 120 calories . Keeps you full between meals with a nutritious and good tasting snack .	1
If you 're expecting something akin to a granola bar or a Fiber Plus bar , you will be sadly disappointed . But , as a lower carb snack with 9 grams of protein , 3 grams of fiber , and 12 essential vitamins and minerals in each bar , this is n't horrible . In fact , if you 've been eating low carb , these will probably be downright tasty . They are drier than your average snack bar since they 're made with soy crispy bits which do n't lend themselves to adding moisture to baked goods . The chocolate flavor is very coco-ey and there is n't a bad aftertaste since it 's made with real sugar and maltitol . Overall , these bars can help keep your diet on track .	1
My normal breakfast bar is the Honey Nut Cheerios Bar . I have tried these South Beach diet Protein Fit Cereal bars in their Cinnamon Raisin flavor and find them to be an acceptable alternative.For those used to regular sugar , you may note a slight aftertaste with these bars that is not present with real sugar products.From a nutritional comparison standpoint the SB bar has 130 Calories with 30 from fat ; the Cheerios bar has 160 Calories with 35 from fat . The SB bar has only 18g of Carbohydrates , while the Cheerios bar has 28g . The SB bar has 9g of Protein , which is three times that of the Cheerios bar.Thus , the South Beach bar is more dietetic and has more protein.As for the flavor , this bar tastes very similar to a raisin breakfast roll or a Cinnabon roll.This is a good product which I can recommend , and it would have gotten five stars , except for the slight aftertaste .	1
I 've tried a ton of different bars over the years and have found that they generally disappoint . Most are either glue-y , cloying sweet , grainy , too chewy , too artificial-tasting , or a combination of several of those undesirable qualities . This , however , is one bar that pleasantly surprised me . I would n't really call it a granola bar , but no matter what it 's called it is a crispy , extra-chocolately way to get a good hit of fiber for the day ( 36 % of the recommended amount ) , which is definitely a batter way to go than most of the fiber supplements out there.The nutritional rundown is:120 calories3.5 g total fat0 trans fat100mg sodium80mg potassium22g carbs9g fiber6g proteinThe bar contains no artificial flavors or sweeteners.It does contain wheat and soy.Bottom line : This bar is great for the serious chocolate-lover who is looking for a good grab-and-run breakfast alternative , or crunchy snack , that will help up your fiber intake in a way you wo n't even notice .	1
I used to enjoy protein bars very often . I stopped primarily because of the vitamin taste most of them had , and the high sugar content , tasting like cardboard did n't help either.This bar is a bit different , now all bars are going to taste a bit of vitamin , after all it is full of vitamins , but his one is a bit better than most I have tried.There are a few things that I would like to be different . Sugar is 8 grams , not bad , fiber is 3 grams not bad for such a small bar but for a protein bar I think 9 grams of protein is a bit skimpy.Salt at 160 is a bit high also , I still can not understand why they insist on using so much salt.I am not going into all the other ingredients , first it is not my job as a Vine Voice to judge ingredients my job is to tell you how good it tastes . I am sure someone else will print the ingredients , honestly they are written so small I am having a bit of trouble seeing them even with my glasses on.As for the flavor it is pretty tasty , the chocolate is strong but not overpowering . Not too sweet tasting . It has a nice bit of crunchiness and not too chewy.All in all a good product . I am going to serve on a jury so this will be along for the ride in case I get hungry . Try this you really will not be sorry .	1
I used to eat the Cinnamon Raisin bars daily until they were discontinued a year ago . The new bars taste just as wonderful , as well as being the same size , so just as gratifying in that sense . I eat 2 bars a day , one for breakfast , and one as an afternoon snack ; very filling and keeps my appetite from going over the edge . I was a little confused as to how many I would receive on Subscribe and Save , I received 8 boxes , 5 bars per box . For Phases 2 and 3 of SBD.Nutritional Facts : 130 calories , 4 grams fat , total carbs 18 , fiber 3 grams , sugars 8 grams , protein 9 grams .	1
I 've always had the terrible habit of only drinking coffee in the morning and not eating anything until about 10 or 11 in the morning . Now that I 'm getting older my metabolism has started slowing down and in an effort to speed it up and lose about 10 lbs. , I 've started eating one bar for breakfast every morning . My husband and I both find the apple cinnamon flavor to be be quite tasty and these do a good job of filling us up for a few hours . Since trying these I 've also purchased the chocolate chunk and peanut butter flavors , both of which we find equally tasty . I recommend these for people who are on the go and need something quick , easy and tasty to put in their stomach as well as people who are trying to lose weight .	1
I 'm not a South Beach diet follower , but I do find they have some pretty tasty options for times when you want something quick and healthy . These have an impressive 12 grams of protein and 9 grams of fiber per bar , which is 180 calories . That 's on the higher side , but I think it 's a worthwhile tradeoff for the fillingness ( is that a word ? ) of the protein and fiber here . Pair it with a glass of water or a mug of green tea , and I find it a very satisfying breakfast .	1
Delicious ! I had put on a little weight over the holidays and have been striving to lose it . I have succeeded , but I know that you need to keep good habits going , so I decided to order these bars . They were so good that I ended up eating the entire box within about three days . Probably not recommended to do that . But that 's just an example of how good they were .	1
I have tried MANY different protein bars . I actually like having these for breakfast , but I find it difficult to find more `` traditional '' breakfast flavors . ( I might be unusual , but I just do n't like having chocolate or peanut butter for breakfast . ) Therefore , I was very glad to see that South Beach was offering this bar in Apple Cinnamon , a variety usually reserved for cereal bars , not protein bars.Biting into this bar provided an immediate burst of fresh apple flavor . Unfortunately , that initial impression did not last , and the taste became a bit more oatmeal-like . Still , I thought that overall , this bar had a nice consistency and good level of sweetness . The nutritional profile was good for me as well , as there was plenty of protein and fiber ( 12 and 9 grams , respectively ) without too much sugar ( 8 grams ) .I have purchased South Beach Meal Bars in the past , and this new flavor is definitely something I would look to buy in the future .	1
It was a delight to discover this wonderful South Beach Diet Meal Bar . I have such a sensitive stomach and yet the doctor says I need fiber for my IBS . I 've gone from soluble to non-soluble , trying to find products that work for me . This definitely worked without causing me any stomach upset and the taste was absolutely delicious . So delicious that I found myself wanting to eat the bars a little too frequently . After trying these bars , I am going to become a frequent buyer of them as well as other South Beach products . Tummy trouble ? Give these bars a chance ; I hope they work as well for you as they do for me . My doctor and I are both happy .	1
I have previously shied away from trying meal bars due to high calorie count , but had heard so much about them , decided to give South Beach a try.I 've been on a strict diet , so did n't want to chance eating too many carbs , so I started out treating myself to one bite at end of low-carb meals . When my blood sugar remained constant , I decided to try one for a full meal . It worked because I was satisfied until my next meal and my bs was still normal.Yay ! Although I like the apple cinnamon , after I found SB served my purpose , I ordered other flavors . Have n't received them yet , but ca n't wait to try them . ( Sure beats eating a piece of my favorite lemon meringue pie or a big maple bar ! ) Yes , it takes will power but these diet meals help ease the pain . : - ) Highly recommended , but not as a steady diet . We all need nourishing fruits , veggies and protein from chicken and fish.Happy eating ! Reviewed by Betty Dravis , May 20 , 2014Author of & # 34 ; Millennium Babe : The Prophecy & # 34 ;	1
These bars are a nice supplement or snack in between meals . I liked the taste -- and I 'm a big fan of the apple cinnamon flavor . This is something I will buy again.Update : my teenager loves the flavor of these , but is n't a fan of the texture . That 's too bad because she needs nutrition like this as a competitive gymnast .	1
All the South Beach bars are very tasty , high in protein , low in fat and nearly no sugars at all . Great for between meal snacks , meal replacements , or high protein meal plans .	1
This South Beach snack is an odd compromise between healthy eating and junk food . It 's packed with energy and protein , and sweet . It 's just not like natural whole foods enough to feel South Beach healthy . Nor is it junk-like enough to please the crowd.I like these bars , although not a lot , and I can eat them . Brought them to work . Nobody else liked them . Some hated them . The people I work with clearly want healthy food to be whole healthy-like and snack food to be richer and maybe more emulsified .	1
I was a little skeptical on these at first . Normally apple cinnamon flavors are light on the apple & full of cinnamon . I actually found these to be good balance with apple being stronger than average . The bar is a little on the heavy side - texture wise / how filling it is , which this how I would prefer a bar . As a meal replacement bar , I need something that 's going to be closer to the mass of a meal - that seems to help with my appetite . All and all , I would definitely recommend these for fans of apple flavoring & someone looking for a meal replacement bar .	1
These meal bars come in a 5 count box . Each bar is 1.76 ounces which is similar in size to slimfast meal bars . They are thick and heavy and they really satisfy your appetite.They taste pretty good and sort of remind me of apple cinnamon oatmeal but they are better because they have a thin layer of icing that makes them much more tasty . Each bar has 180 calories , 3.5 grams of fat , 9 grams of dietary fiber , 8 grams of sugar and 12 grams of protein . These bars can help you lose weight if used correctly . 180 calories is n't bad for something that will leave you feeling satisfied for about 3 hours .	1
I have loved these bars for year and still keep a box around for the days I just ca n't get to breakfast . I cut down to 4 stars because they have done away with my favorite flavors ( like Cinnamon and Dark chocolate ) .	1
Best Health Bars Ever ! ! It tastes better than anything I have ever tried . So healthy too ! I will alway have these on hand .	1
I really like the taste of this bar . It has a sour apple taste . It does have a little gritty taste to it , though . There 's 6g of fat in each bar , 9g of fiber , 8g of sugar and 12g of protein . There are no artificial sweeteners but it does have sugar . It 's got a candy like layer on the bottom . While these bars are filling , I will not be eating them as a meal replacement . An in-between-meal snack is more appropriate . At 180 calories , it 's kind of much for a snack though . If you can get by with a small amount of food for meals , you would do well with this bar . The taste is quite good . There are ( 5 ) bars in the box .	1
I like these South Beach Diet Meal Bars ( Apple Cinnamon ) , but do n't love them . They do n't have any artificial sweeteners or flavors , and I find they taste pretty good . They are a little on the sweet side , but to me that 's not a bad thing . The apple cinnamon flavor despite being sweet , tastes natural to me . I find the bars to be filling , and enough for me to skip breakfast if I had to.I find these South Beach Diet Meal Bars ( Apple Cinnamon ) to be good , but not great . If you like `` sweets '' but are looking for something a little bit healthier , then I can recommend these .	1
These tasted OK as a meal replacement bar but were nothing exciting . When you first bite in , you get a little bit of an apple pie type of taste , but when you finish eating , there is a vitamin-like after taste . I 'd recommend downing them with a little of milk to take the edge off of them .	1
I love apple-flavored bars , but am also on a bit of a diet . So these hit the spot perfectly . The apple cinnamon flavor is n't too rich or sweet , but is definitely noticeable . In other words , these do n't taste like cardboard . They 're obviously not as sweet or tasty as a regular candy bar , but nor should they be.More importantly , the bars also contain quite a bit of protein and fiber . This not only reduces the amount of carbs you get through your snacking , but also fills you up much quicker than a typical candy bar would . I snacked on these and real apples during a recent 8-hour trip and found them far more than sufficient to hold me off until my next meal.Overall , recommended .	1
These taste great and are filling , making them an ideal snack . They 're loaded with fiber ... just do n't eat too many at a time , or the high fiber content can cause some stomach discomfort .	1
Flight food being what it is these days , if you 're not in first class , it 's always handy to have something like the South Beach Meal Bars on hand to stave off the starvation airline peanuts ca n't touch . The Apple Cinnamon Meal Bars are tangy , chewy , and satisfying , and make you think that you might be doing your body a favor by eating them instead of the Snickers bar you also smuggled onto the plane ... although you 'll probably eat that too . At least , to start , you can tell yourself you ate something at least vaguely nutritious .	1
The South Beach Diet Apple Cinnamon Flavored Meal Bars are as good as the South Beach Chocolate Raspberry Meal Bars I reviewed earlier on my Amazon website . The Apple Cinnamon Bars have 12g of protein and 180 calories with no artificial sweeteners . The bars have a good apple pie taste and crunchy texture . One bar sticks with you , and I did n't feel hungry for a couple of hours after eating one . I am a marathoner and an Apple Cinnamon bar is good to eat before a training run . I expect ( but have not tried yet ) one would be good at the 15 mile mark of a marathon.Ingredients : soy protein nuggets , fiber blend , rolled oats , tapioca syrup , fractionated palm kernel and palm oil , dried apples , sugar , soy protein isolate , water , nonfat milk , natural flavor , maltodextrin , calcium phosphate , nonfat yogurt powder , dextrose , salt , soy lecithin , calcium carbonate , ascorbic acid , alpha-tocopherol , acetate , caramel added for color , tocopherols added to protect flavor , ferric orthophosphate , soybean oil , niacinamide , zinc oxide , calcium pantothenate , Vitamin A Acetate , pyridoxine hydrochloride , ribovlavin , thiamine mononitrate , folic acid , biotin , phytonadione , Vitamin D3 , and Vitamin B12.Allergen Information : contains soybean milk , produced on equipment that also processes peanuts , tree nuts , egg , wheat , and sesame.I give the South Beach Apple Cinnamon Flavored Meal Bars my highest rating for satiety and energy . There is information on the box about the South Beach Diet that seems like a reasonable way to use the Bars as part of a weight loss program .	1
good meal for you when you are busy and on the go , ( like running late for work in the morning ) .	1
I find them good for the occassional meal when it is convenient for me . Taste is pretty good and I like the texture .	1
Note : This review is for the apple cinnamon bars.I 've had a number of diet bars , but this was the first time I 've had any of the South Beach bars . I enjoyed the apple cinnamon bars , although as a meal replacement , they 're just a bit too sweet for my taste . I think I would have really liked them if they had left off the sweet icing . A pleasant apple and cinnamon scent is obvious when the bar is unwrapped , and the tastes of apple and cinnamon are very noticeable . I enjoyed the crispy texture of the soy protein nuggets that make up most of the bar.Nutritionally , these bars are better than most breakfast bars that I 've had . The 12 grams of protein make up more than a fourth of the 180 calories in the bar . Total carbohydrates are 25 grams , but the 9 grams of dietary fiber would reduce the net carbohydrates to a level that 's probably acceptable for most diabetics ( including myself ) .Overall , I liked the apple cinnamon bars and would have given them 5 stars if they had n't been quite so sweet . If you 're looking for a sweetish taste , however , these may be exactly what you 're looking for .	1
I love these bars , they are delicious and my go to breakfast nearly every morning . They are a subscribe and save item , which I have been receiving for over a year . Highly recommended low carb meal replacement bar .	1
This is by far the best tasting apple bar I have tried . It is ooey and gooey and appley . Reminds me of apple pie . An enjoyable , easy snack .	1
These are not my favorite South Beach meal bars , but they are quite good , and they have 9 grams of fiber and 12 grams of protein , so they are easy on one 's blood sugar levels . I find them a satisfying substitute for other unhealthy treats when I am craving something sweet.I drink lots of liquid when I eat one of these bars since it makes the fiber in them easier to digest and eliminates any possible risk of choking from the fiber content getting stuck in my throat.All in all , this is a good choice for a meal bar.Ingredients : Soy Protein Isolate , Tapioca Starch , Rice Flour , Barely Malt Extract , Salt , Unsweetened Chocolate , Sugar , Dextrose , Soy Lecithin , Natural Flavor , Chicory Root Fiber , Rolled Oats , Soluble Corn Fiber , Tapioca Syrup , High Oleic Sunflower Oil , Fractionated Palm Kernel Oil , Water , Cocoa ( Processed with Alkali ) , Calcium Phosphate , Lactose , Calcium Carbonate , Ascorbic Acid , Maltodextrin , Alpha-Tocopherol Acetate , Rebaudioside A ( Stevia ) , Tocopherols ( Added to Protect Flavor ) , Soybean Oil , Ferric Orthophosphate , Niacinamide , Zinc Oxide , Calcium Pantothenate , Vitamin A Acetate , Pyridoxine Hydrochloride , Riboflavin , Thiamine Mononitrate , Folic Acid , Biotin , Phytonadione , Vitamin D3 , Vitamin B12.Nutrition Information:12g Protein180 Calories ( minus 36 calories for fiber , net 144 calories ) 6g of Total Fat Per Serving ( no trans fats ) 9g fiber8g sugarsBalanced NutritionNo Artificial Flavors or SweetenersKosher Dairy	1
I like having meal bars on hand for when I 'm on the run and need to grab something quick but filling . I usually buy Atkins ' bars , but thought I 'd try these since I love cinnamon and apple . They 're good , but the icing has a slightly odd flavor to me . The apple flavor is good , as is the cinnamon , and I like the crunchy texture . I 've had them as a quick lunch several times and they keep me from feeling hungry for several hours . They also seem a lot healthier than a handful of crackers or chips , which are often just kind of a filler . They would probably be an even better light breakfast . In general , I like the Atkins bars better , but these South Beach meal bars are a satisfying change .	1
As far as meal replacement bars go , these South Beach Diet Apple Cinnamon are pretty good . For only 180 calories , it 's a decent size considering most I 've tried are more calories and much smaller . It also has a decent amount of protein and fills me up when eaten for breakfast . I can say it satisfies me until lunch , which is not always the case with meal replacement bars.As for the flavor , I have yet to find any product of this type that I would call delicious , but these are definitely better than most . I usually go with a chocolate flavor bar , but this Apple Cinnamon is a lot better . There is after taste and it does n't taste as & # 34 ; artificial & # 34 ; as some do.I would buy these again for sure because they are in the calorie range I like for breakfast , taste pretty good and satisfy me for most of the morning .	1
I like to have protein bars in my bag in case I have a snack attack so I thought I would try these . I have tried a lot of protein bars and this has a softer consistency than some which I value ... .I do n't want to have to gnaw at a bar . I did think it was dry and I wanted something to drink with it but that does n't bother me.As far as the flavor is concerned , it has a subtle flavor of apples and cinnamon but unfortunately I am not fond of that kind of flavoring so I did not find it to be particularly appealing but that is just my preference . For anyone who does like apple cinnamon flavor I am sure this would be pleasant.Nutritionally this bar is supposed to be a meal bat with 12g of protein and 180 calories . It 's real purpose is to supplement the South Beach Diet Program . It does not have any trans fat or cholesterol and that is all good ... a long list of ingredients but it is a packaged product and I expect that.I would not buy this exact bar but I think I would consider other products that are flavors that I enjoy	1
I really liked the taste of this bar , and it really gave me a feeling of being full . I would recommend this product if you need a quick meal on the run .	1
The words that describe this bar are all positive ! Convenient , Tastes Great , Perfect , On the Go , Satisfying , and Healthy are all words my family uses to describe this delicious bar . The flavor was just right , and I have been told to continue purchase them . If you are looking for a meal bar that is satisfying and delicious , this is the bar for you . This is yet another phenomenal product from South Beach .	1
Diet bars are all about context . If I have been without carbs for weeks , they are manna dripping from the heavens . If I have not been dieting , they are practically inedible . Thankfully , these are actually pretty good regardless because of the abundance of dry apple . The fruit brings the & # 34 ; science experiment & # 34 ; quality of the bars down and tricks the brain into thinking that they are food . They go particularly well with milk if your diet allows it.Otherwise , the flavor and texture are pretty typical for diet bars - compressed soy nuggets with non-descript confectioner coating and a mild chemical aftertaste.If diet bars are part of your life , these are worth a shot .	1
Right now my main meal replacement bars are Hydroxycut . While they are still my favorite I find adding different kinds top three rotation can be nice.My husband will only eat the bars I previously mentioned so I thought I 'd try these . I actually really like them since they seem to be made more for me . Less calories , less fat and above all less protein ( since I 'm not looking to bulk up ) .My only complaints about this flavor is that our reminds me of instant oatmeal . Its also a harder consistency then I 'm use to so my jaw is actually a little sore after eating one.Other than that they are a great meal alternative , I would just recommend trying one bar ( if possible ) before buying 1 or more boxes .	1
These bars were a pleasant surprise . They have a nice texture and good flavor with only 8 grams of sugar for a 50 gram bar . At sixteen percent , this is the lowest sugar content of any snack bar that I have tried . They are however , a hefty 180 calories . I do not use them as a whole meal , but rather as a snack . So , in order not to take on all the calories at once , I cut them in half and save the second half for another time . I have also found that they are good if you leave them in the refrigerator . That makes them a little more solid and chewy .	1
I 've had several other kinds of meal replacement bars in the past , and some of them I could barely choke down . This one , however ( SB Apple Cinnamon ) was decent . It 's not your grandmother 's apple crisp , of course , but it did taste something like apple crisp without all the sugar . The texture was fine as well , I was pretty happy with the flavor , and there was n't any nasty aftertaste . May have been a bit dry , but overall , I 'd recommend these meal bars .	1
This review is for Apple cinnamon flavor . Taste is very pleasant , with strong apple and cinnamon . Just dropped one star because it 's a little too sweet for my taste buds . Each bar has 12g of protein , 9g fiber and 180 calories .	1
The bar is smaller than I expected ( the packaging is bigger than the actual bar ) but the taste is pretty good - the bottom crust reminds me of a Rice Krispies marshmellow treat bar but the taste is closer to that of a McDonald 's apple pie that has gotten cooled and flattened . It 's sweet but not overly so , which I like.The only downside is that I 'm still hungry after one bar , so I would hesitate to call it a & # 34 ; meal. & # 34 ; It has lots of protein but it 's not filling enough for me . Otherwise , I like the taste of it and plan to get more .	1
For a meal bar , these are OK. You have to expect that an ersatz meal is going to be an ersatz experience . If you think Prime Rib and Yorkshire Pudding with Horseradish Cr & egrave ; me low calorie meal bars exist , dream on . They don & # 8217 ; t , sorry to say . If you are going to be somewhere where you can & # 8217 ; t have a decent , nutritious but low calorie meal , eating one of these bars is not going to kill you . It is a far better alternative than having an Egg McMuffin for instance . Or a giant bacon cheese burger , French fries and a malted . It hurts for me to say it , but it is true . Eat half of a bar and an apple or some yogurt . I found the taste of these & # 8220 ; Apple Cinnamon & # 8221 ; bars to be vaguely familiar of apples and cinnamon in a rather distant , yet not unpleasant way .	1
I am typically wary of most bars because many people automatically assume they are healthy , low calorie , etc . If one does turn out to be healthy , that does not mean you can eat them unfettered and without restraint.While I typically tend to stick with protein-heavy bars , sometimes a little change can be good and sometimes you want a lower calorie snack ( most protein bars hover in the 200 range ) . These bars have 100 calories but are considerably smaller than I expected . As such , they certainly should not be considered a meal replacement but a snack only.I absolutely can not stand for a bar to be bland , dry or have an aftertaste . I was glad to try out a bar with caramel ( yum ! ) and chocolate along with the nuts . I was disappointed , however , to find these bars had a few questionable ingredients , such as fractionated oil & natural flavor . You are going to find unhealthy ingredients in most manufactured foods , and I tend to look over the lesser evils on occasion.Regardless , for a quick , lower calorie snack , I think these would work for most people . I love caramel so this made the bar a little more appealing to my palate , but I am not fond of having so much sugar in such a small item . I would consider buying them on occasion , moreso for my teenaged son , as they are still healthier than regular candy bars.I do think the bars are a little pricey for the quantity of food you are receiving . I can purchase good protein bars on sale for the same price.Although this item was sent to me to evaluate for the Amazon Vine program , I always provide honest reviews based on my own opinion for all items ( Vine & non-Vine ) . I also look at the price of the item and comment on that as well when applicable , based on whether or not I would purchase the item on my own .	1
These SOUTH BEACH DIET SNACK BARS in the FUDGY CHOCOLATE MINT flavor are quite good . If you like the smell and taste of Girl Scout Thin Mint cookies , you 'll probably like these . Each bar has 100 calories with a good deal of fiber and protein . I would never have known without reading the label that they are composed of such high-tech ingredients as chicory , soy protein isolate and oat flour . All in all , it 's a very tasty snack that may well help the dieter avoid the higher-calorie temptations of candy or cookies .	1
No , these are not the healthiest things out there but as a little `` healthy '' pleasure , they fit the bill . If you want help resisting a candy bar and want to splurge without eating a Snickers bar , this is a satisfying substitute . When I was a kid my mom made a delicious dessert out of pulverized mint candies , whipped cream , and chocolate wafers . This bar reminded me of that dish in flavor and even in the crunchiness of the chocolate `` pebbles '' in the middle . I thought this tasted great , and in a weak moment I would definitely reach for one .	1
I 've been on a diet for about 1.5 months and in that time span , I 've lost just under 20 pounds . I 'm trying to cut down on sugar and junk food , but every now and then you have a itch that just has to be scratched . Do you know what I mean ? So these bars have a really nice flavor with a solid dose of chocolate . Yet they are n't jam-packed with sugar and at only 100 calories per bar , you are not going to feel overly guilty eating one.I am not really so much into mint either , but I do like the minty taste of these South Beach bars . The mint is nicely integrated with the dark chocolate and is not & # 34 ; overly minty & # 34 ; .These bars are enjoyable and I was sorry when the box was empty . 5 stars .	1
I love these . They .remind me of a chocolate mint candy bar but you can enjoy without the guilt . I have been very satisfied with all the South Beach bars that I have tried so far .	1
This snack bar actually tasted pretty yummy . It is small , but has real ingredients and no fake sugars . It makes a great treat for when you want a little something sweet without killing the waistline.There are only 5 per box , so it could get pricey if you have one everyday.Nevertheless , for a diet snack bar , it is tasty and chocolate-y .	1
These are the kind of bars that are perfect to stash at work , in your purse or in a gym bag for a quick snack . They are maybe 2/3 the size of a regular granola size bar , more akin to a weightwatcher bar if you are familiar with their snacks . The bar is 100 calories with no artificial flavors or sweeteners . 35 calories are from fat , ( 10 % saturated ) , no cholesterol , 85 mg of sodium , 95 mgs of potassium , 5 g sugar , 6 grams of protein and 6g of fiber . Calcium weighs in at 10 % and iron at 8 % .Now for the taste ... .hubby loves chocolate and mint together , so he gave a two thumbs up and said , yes , buy them again ! I did n't think they were quite at a girl scout cookie level of scrumptiousness , but thought they were pretty darn good and not too sweet or too mint heavy . I too would purchase/eat them again.Overall , if you need a quick snack or are trying to watch your intake of calories , these may be just the trick to take the edge off your hunger !	1
The good news : the South Beach Diet bars are as tasty as a standard candy bar with less sugar & fat , fewer calories , and more protein & fiber . The bad news : they have more net carbs than competing low-carb protein bars like Atkins or EAS AdventEdge Carb Control . The flip side of the higher carb content is that the SBD ones are definitely tastier than the rival bars . This bar could plausibly pass for a regular candy bar , while the lower carb bars could n't . So I would say these are for the times when someone really craves a candy bar but wants to make a somewhat healthier choice.My husband , kids , and I all agreed that the SBD bars are delicious .	1
I 'm going on a trip in a week and I always bring protein or snack bars & # 34 ; just in case & # 34 ; no food is served on the plane or we do n't have time to eat a meal due to sightseeing or running to catch a train , bus or plane.Tried one of these to make sure they were & # 34 ; edible & # 34 ; ( I 'm sure if you are a protein bar buyer you have purchased some that taste like cardboard and are hard to choke down ) and they were great . Loved the peanut-caramel combination.Each box contains five bars that are 100 calories each . The peanut/caramel combination is covered in chocolate ( so these are n't great for traveling to hot climates , but will be fine in a cooler environment ) . There are 15g of carbs and 6g of protein . I need a higher protein ratio in order not to get what I call the 'carb shakes , ' but the 6g were fine ! I really liked these and recommend if you are a protein/snack bar afficiendo to at least give them a try .	1
I just got my order today and I have to say I was worried about buying 5 packs of these since I have never tried them before but all I can say is DELICIOUS ! ! ! These will be on my list to buy again ! ! ! A perfect snack food for when you have to have someone chocolate ! ! ! AND IT CONTAINS NO SUGAR ALCOHOL ! ! !	1
These are quite good , bordering on addictive . I did n't expect much , understanding these are carb-controlled , but they remind me of a mix of a candy bar and a cookie , they taste a bit like those Chocolate Mint Girl Scout cookies . I took off a star because I wish it were bigger and I did n't find these terribly filling , but I have a large appetite . I think they are good for a low-cal dessert at only 100 calories per bar + 14 carbs . Another pro is no Splenda *woot* , I ca n't handle that stuff . I will definitely be purchasing more soon .	1
This is one of many 100 calorie diet snack foods on the market . It has a good flavor , and is more filling than some others . It had no significant after taste ( a problem with some diet bars ) . With 6 grams of protein , and 6 grams of fiber , it has reasonably good food content for the money . Products of this type tend to be heat sensitive , and it probably should not be ordered in hot weather ( likewise , it probably should not be carried in your pocket ) . The price varies depending on the size package ordered , and the Amazon price is comparable with prices found elsewhere.The is a `` Best by '' date on the wrapper .	1
I 've always been a `` South Beach '' bar fan . They taste really good ( much better than Extend for example ) , and are a sensible amount of calories and carbohydrates for a snack . The bars are quite small in size , but they are filling all the same . They also do n't upset my stomach , which is a plus . The biggest trick is making sure you limit yourself to only one for your snack : /This particular flavor is one of the better ones I 've tried . I put it right up there with Atkins Chocolate Hazelnut ( mmmmm )	1
This is a very tasty , low carbohydrate & # 34 ; special treat & # 34 ; snack for when we ca n't live without chocolate . I actually do n't even try to live without chocolate but sometimes the 85 % dark chocolate bars do n't quiet feel like dessert.This is SMALL , and for me does not substitute for a meal , but it also does n't raise my blood sugar and set me up for low blood sugar in the middle of the afternoon if that 's all I had for lunch . They have a good fiber gram per calorie ratio but did n't give me gas if I ate only one.Price - I would n't spend this on something to use daily but will probably use them when I ... OK , I 'm the mom , and the one with the special dietary needs , so I buy my own stocking stuffers . This will be on the list .	1
I really like the taste and texture of these bars , and since they are only 100 calories I can have one between meals as a snack or in the evening if I am really hungry without worrying about over indulging .	1
Great taste and I like the consistency of the filling , an easy way to snack , it would be nice if it had just a little less sugar in it .	1
These petite bars are quite tasty - with a rich chocolate coating and a dense , chewy center . Though the list of ingredients is long , with a few unpronounceable additives , there is no discernible aftertaste nor off flavors - just pleasant and chocolatey.At just 100 calories , they are certainly not a meal replacement , but can help satisfy those between-meal urges that might lead you to the vending machine filled with other bad choices . The trick is to take small bites and chew slowly to maximize the taste sensation and trick your mind into thinking that you 're getting a lot more ... I keep one or two in my desk drawer and they help keep me away from the bagels and donuts that seem to proliferate around the office .	1
I initially tried these bars as an add on item . If you have had other low carb bars , they have a similar texture . The bars taste like a thin mint without the crunch . A great & # 34 ; sweet & # 34 ; for those on a low carb diet or looking for a dessert alternative .	1
I 've been checking out South Beach bars every time they create a new one , and so far , including this bar , I have not been disappointed . This is a bar with fiber and protein , so it is less likely to raise your blood sugar than a candy bar . Though it is n't a lot of food , it satisfies your hunger when you are on the go and have no time for a meal -- or you are hungry between meals and do n't want to eat too many calories.These bars taste great . If you like sweet , it is quite sweet . It is chewy and crispy at the same time , kind of a healthy version of a Snickers type candy bar . I would definitely turn to this bar when I get a craving for chocolate , because the chocolate taste is terrific.This particular product is packaged as a snack bar versus a meal bar , meaning that the gross calories are only 100 ( actually only 76 minus the fiber ) instead of 200 or so calories in some of the South Beach meal bars.Finally , and possibly most important , even though I am hyper-sensitive to fiber , the fiber in this bar does not cause me any discomfort.Ingredients : Soy protein isolate , chicory root fiber , sugar , fractionated palm kernel , palm oil , tapioca syrup , soluble corn fiber , peanuts , agave syrup , water , cocoa processed with alkali , glycerine , tapioca starch , nonfat milk , natural flavor , lactose , salt , soy lecithin , dextrose.WARNING : Contains milk , soy , peanuts , processed on equipment that also praocesses tree nuts , egg , wheat , sesame.Nutrition Facts : Fat : 4 gm ( no trans fats ) Carbohydrate : 15 gm ( 6 gm fiber ) Protein : 6 gmTotal Calories : 100 ( net 76 minus fiber )	1
These snack bars are good , but nothing really exciting . I much prefer the Atkins bars , but these are fine in a pinch . The chocolate is n't nearly as rich as the chocolate Atkins uses . These bars are designed for snacking rather than a whole meal , so they are smaller and do n't satisfy for as long , but they 're tasty . The nuts are finely-ground , so they lack a satisfying crunch , but they taste good . I can recommend these bars as a healthy snack , but ca n't jump up and down about them overall .	1
Chocolate mint is a popular flavor for diet snack bars . I expected this would be like any other but actually I think it has a little bit nicer taste . It 's still a diet bar so you have to be realistic in your expectations but I found that this box disappeared pretty quick so I have to say it 's a preferred snack bar for me . The product description does not lie.. even those not watching their weight may like these so you might want to keep them out of sight !	1
These remind me of Girl Scout Thin mint cookies . With 6 grams of protein and only 100 calories they are great snack . They have 6 grams of fiber and only 5 grams of sugar they taste like you 're eating a candy bar . I had no lasting unpleasant fake sugar taste in my mouth after I ate them . I felt satisfied for about 2 hours after I ate the bar . I would purchase these bars again .	1
I was offered the South Beach Diet Snack Bar , Fudgy Chocolate Mint flavor as a Vine selection . Since I like having healthy snacks available at work for those days when lunch and dinner just seem too far apart , I gave them a try . Full disclosure forces me to admit that chocolate mint is a favorite of mine . This bar did not disappoint . Although I wo n't go as far as to say that this is as good as a handful of chocolate mint candies , it is very satisfying and tasty . I will buy these for future consumption , and recommend them to friends .	1
I have struggled with my weight for the past 40 years , so I 'm always looking for products that help keep my weight under control . These are delicious and more filling than most foods that only come up to 100 calories . The nice round number of calories also helps with keeping track of my daily intake . I do a limited & # 34 ; fast & # 34 ; 2 days a week where I keep my intake below 500 calories per day , and these help me do it .	1
As far as a diet bar - these are great ! Tasty if you like Chocolate mint which I do . They do not however keep you from eating too much in general . And that is their only flaw .	1
For the calories this is a perfect little snack and if you 're anything like me who loves sneaking chocolate during the day this is a guilt-free way of caving into that craving.I was disappointed by the size of the bar in relation to its packaging . I felt like I was missing out on about 25 % of the bar and I can eat this in 3 bites . I guess that 's how they keep it at 100 calories ! When you open the wrapper it smells just as delightful as a Girl Scout Thin Mint . The taste does not disappoint . It tastes just like a Thin Mint ! The texture , however , is harder and chewier and now you know you 're eating something healthier than those sinfully delicious cookies.Added plus - my daughter loves these bars and they are perfect for me to send to school in her backpack as for her snack time . I will definitely be buying these again in the future .	1
Unlike a lot of snack bars these actually taste good . So if you need a little snack between meals then this is a good option .	1
These are very tasty . They taste similar to the Thin Mints cookies . I eat nutrition or protein bars often for lunch or for an afternoon snack , and these will be great for that .	1
I have been on Medifast for the last 6 weeks , ( lost 21 lbs and counting , hold your applause ) so when I was offered a free box of these bars I thought I would take a taste and compare the two . As far as taste goes it is pretty good , but the nutritional value in the medifast bars are a bit higher but a bit more expensive . I see no reason to change from my bars to these bars over the long term , but for a quick snack without the calories and fat at a fair price ( as of this writing ) I do n't see how you could go wrong . PS I miss bread .	1
At 100 Calories per bar , I love these South Beach bars for a chocolate fix that wo n't ruin my diet . 6 grams of protein make these bars an especially great snack before or after a workout.The bars are smaller than a vending machine candy bar . But what they lack in size , they make up for with a rich moist chocolatey taste . If you 're looking for a good snack bar that is a step up from just empty calories and sugar give these South Beach bars a try .	1
Whipped Peanut Butter- Oh my goodness ! The Whipped Peanut Butter Snack Bars are incredible ! I received 3 different South Beach Diet Bars in the mail and this one was one of them . I could n't believe how incredible I found them . They were nice and fluffy and the flavor was absolutely heavenly to me . 5+ Stars for this option.Whipped Chocolate Almond- Yummy ! After trying the Whipped Peanut Butter Bars I had to try this one . They 're just as great and also nice and fluffy . Tom me they seem almost like a 3 musketeers bar or a cross between that and a milky way ( without the caramel ) . I absolutely love these Whipped options.Fudgy Chocolate Mint- I had to buy some of these to try as well . They 're really good too . There 's a nice crunch to these , not too hard but not soft and fluggy like the whipped options . The chocolate and mint flavor is really nice.Chocolate Caramel Nut- Wow ! So much different than the others . I did n't care for it . They were way too hard . Felt like I was gon na break a tooth eating it . The flavors were n't bad but it was just too difficult to eat which made me dislike it . I got this single sample from another source as well . 2 Stars for this option.They 're small but what do you expect for just 100 calories ? These bars make a great snack for in-between meals . I usually rely on Diet Bars for Snacks , Breakfast and Lunch so I 'm always on the lookout for some new options . Usually all I keep in-stock are Slim Fast bars because I 've tried several different brands and have n't really found any that I would actually say that I like . That is until I discovered some of these South Beach Diet Bars . After my first couple bites of the Whipped Peanut Butter bars I was pulling them up on Amazon to add to my Wish List . Will certainly be ordering some of those and and they 've opened me up to wanting to try some other South Beach Diet Bars.I really loved the Whipped Bars and really liked the Chocolate Mint options too . I would highly recommend trying any of those 3 options .	1
My first impression of the South Beach Diet Chocolate Caramel Peanut snack bar is that it is really SMALL . The bars weigh just slightly less than an ounce each , and are about the length of a stubby dry-erase pen , so a person would get three , perhaps four bites from each one . Fortunately , they are good bites . The bars have a slightly earthy , dark chocolate flavor complimented by the caramel which is sweet but not cloyingly sweet . Since I have spent the past few months avoiding extra sugars , I was happy to discover that this snack bar was not too sweet . Another plus is that it is chewy , and that texture helps in the satisfaction of eating it . With 6 grams of protein and only 100 calories , I found it a nice treat that did not make me feel as if I were breaking my diet regimen . Recommended .	1
Over the years I 've tried dozens of `` power '' bars and `` energy '' snack bars . Some taste terrible some are palatable and a few are good . I would put these in the `` good '' tasting category . They are a great snack source made with healthy ingredients and really a pretty good taste .	1
Fudgy Chocolate Mint is GOOD ! I keep these in my car just in case I get hungry . I 'm on low-cal diet and get dizzy when I do n't eat immediately after getting hunger pains . I really liked it . I love mint flavorings . Size is on a smaller side , but I do n't need a lot , it 's just a snack to hold me over until you get to a place where you can have a meal .	1
The creamy caramel of this South Beach Diet Snack bar was a delight to the palate . The texture seemed softer and better tasting than other nutritional bars I 've sampled . At 100 calories , the bars offer a good nutritional source . Each bar provides 6 grams of protein , 15 g. carbs , 130 mg. sodium , lower than other comparable snack bars . Anyone into good nutrition will like the fact these bars contain no high fructose corn syrup.I recommend this handy , tasty snack to anyone who wants a quick pick-me-up that will promote good taste and nutrition .	1
It 's simply the best coffee in the world ! I love my cup of Tim 's when I 'm out and about , but this is a great substitute for brewing at home .	1
I bought this for my grandfathers birthday , it made a perfect gift because he drinks a lot of coffee . I wanted to get him a good grade coffee because I know they go for the cheaper ones to save on money , so I wanted this to be & # 34 ; special & # 34 ; .Anyway , he really liked this coffee and makes a great gift to anyone who is a coffee drinker .	1
GREAT coffee . It 's the only coffee we drink . We have tried many different brands of coffee and , by far , this is the best .	1
I have n't been a big coffee drinker in years . A business trip to Canada a couple years back turned me on to Tim Horton 's coffee . I love this stuff and so does my wife . It 's better than DD or Starbucks and it does n't cost an arm and a leg . Highly recommended .	1
Read several reviews on this coffe and all rated high , so bought a can and the flavor is very good a smooth not bitter coffee..I have been a couple times to Tim Hortons but only remember the doughnuts ! I will buy the coffee again !	1
We bought this based on Amazon buyer 's reviews and we were n't disappointed ~ placing another order now ... it 's our new favorite coffee !	1
this is a very good coffee , I like it better than starbucks and others.. it smells great and tastes even better !	1
I do n't like coffees that you get at the grocery store . I 've been using a couple of other brands from Amazon but now they carry Tim Horton 's which is soooooo good . I 'm from Western New York where there 's a Tim Horton 's coffee/donut shop on every other corner . The rumor has always been that the company put something addictive in their coffee ... not true . It 's just a good cup of coffee . Nothing fancy and no bitterness . Just a really good cup of java ! Love it and love the fact that it 's now available on Amazon for those of us who have moved far away from those coffee shops ! Thank you !	1
I buy this coffee for my Canadian husband . He loves it . It 's not bitter like a lot of other coffees are . He said it 's not quite as good as the coffee you buy in a Tim Horton 's coffee shop , but it 's the next best thing . I guess that 's saying a lot for a Canadian . They do love their Timmy 's .	1
its coffee , and it tastes good , had to say more to get the 18 words required to get this to work .	1
I usually buy eight oclock coffee , which I still buy . This is a bit stronger coffee.I would say that this is a good tasting coffee and would buy it again if the price were a little cheaper . I am sure the a coffee lover would find this to their liking .	1
I was so excited about getting this in the mail.I have heard so much about the great flavor . Well as soon as I received it I made myself and hubby a small batch .We were thrilled . It is delicious . I made the next pot a little stronger and it was even better . This coffee does not have a bitter taste . Sometimes when you make a strong brew coffee does have a bitter flavor . Not this . I could go on and on but truly this will be the only coffee I will buy from now on . I only hope that amazon will continue to sell it.Get happy Buy it !	1
It has a smooth flavor and smells great in the making . We are coffee fressers ! and love our coffee .	1
'Tim Hortons ' coffee has such a high quality and enticing flavor that keeps you yearning for each and every sip . It does require a can opener , but this small inconvenience is worth it because of the rich , fresh aroma that delivers on its own promise . My only wish is that this coffee would be available for `` Subscribe & Save ' ! A slight inaccuracy : the picture shown here is for a 35.3 OZ can - it is actually a 32.8 OZ as stated in the description . This is minor marketing issue and does not change the high opinion I have for this coffee . My only real complaint is that they are currently out of stock !	1
Tim Hortons is good coffee . It is definitely the price . Honestly not much more to say . Try it ; you will like it .	1
I got introduced to Tim Horton 's by taking up curling ; it was in the bag I won and at that time it had to be & # 34 ; smuggled & # 34 ; from Canada . Now that Amazon is & # 34 ; smuggling & # 34 ; this product in I can get it much more regularly . A favorite when I want coffee . The flavor is nice and rich without being to overpowering or having a burnt taste .	1
I really like drinking this coffee at home , especially since there are no Tim Hortons stores nearby . If you have n't had it , the coffee has a very smooth taste and is probably a medium roast . The large canisters are about the size of 3 bags ( Coffee Fine Grind Bag ) so I find the canister more convenient if you brew this really frequently ( and I think it is also slightly cheaper per oz ) . The canisters arrived quickly and in perfect condition , with no dents or anything . I am extremely happy to be able to find Timmys coffee here on Amazon for a reasonable price !	1
The best coffee I have ever tasted ! Rich and sastisfying . Too bad there are no Tim Horton coffee shops in California .	1
Love it , love it , love it . Tim Horton 's is our favorite coffee and it 's really nice to be able to brew a pot ( or 3 ) at home every day .	1
this is a great size of the coffee mentioned earlier . Very affordable . I love to be able to get great coffee at a great price .	1
This is the price you pay for not living close to a Costco warehouse . Ths salmon is excellent . No bones , no skin , just beautifully red salmon with an incredible flavor . I use this for salmon patties - a little hollandaise sauce with frozen peas and you have old fashioned diner comfort food . Best salmon patties I ever made - even as leftovers the next day . Okay to order here until summer , when we will travel 300 miles to the nearest Costco and stock up .	1
Kirkland is the house brand of Costco . I just read that Costco **stopped canning** this wonderful salmon , and some of the comments to that article were from 2011 . It makes me sad , that was the best canned salmon on the planet , ever . So my question is , HOW OLD IS IT ? I do n't plan to pay a premium for old canned fish just because it 's become 'rare ' and some retailer decided to raise price to `` what the market will bear '' .	1
Expensive , as all wild red Alaska salmon is , but worth it . Much less liquid in the can . We wo n't buy it often , but we will buy it again .	1
I like the flavor of this wild salmon , and there is no waste , as there is with some of the store purchased brands .	1
This was pretty tasty , not at all salty and retained some of its healthy oils whereas some canned fish are so overcooked and dry . This reminded me of Vital Choices sockeye salmon . It was flaky and had a nice color to it . I would purchase again .	1
This is an excellent product , but still rather pricey in my book . I found similar , great-tasting canned Sockeye Salmon at a supermarket for nearly $ 2 less per can , but the meat was n't as firm and it contained some skin . So , If you want top of the line and can afford it , this is wonderful salmon .	1
How you like it depends on how you prepare it . Nice chunks of beef in a flavorful broth . I used three cans to make beef tips over noodles for two of us . I & # 34 ; doctored & # 34 ; it a little bit . Not because of anything wrong with the product , because it is very good . Kirkland did all the hard work in prepping the beef , I took it to the next level . First , I cooked cut up carrots in some Tone 's beef base and water in large saucepan , added some frozen peas and canned mushrooms about 10 minutes before the carrots were done . Then I added the beef and juices , added cornstarch and a lilttle horseradish ( great with beef , right ? ) let it heat through and thicken and served over wide egg noodles ( or you could use rise instead . ) It was quick and very tasty . For someone who cooks from scratch most days , this was a very good , easy to make , satisfying meal . Nice for weeknight cooking . Got me in and out of the kitchen fast . One pan clean up , little prep . Nice change of pace . Excellent leftovers for small lunch the next day . Highly recommend .	1
VERY TASTY MAKES GREAT GOULASH WITH NOODLES OR RICE AND JUST ABOUT ANYTHING	1
Of course he prefers beef but even he liked changes now and then..However this got a very good response from him .	1
I love green tea , I love Kit Kats , but the two do not belong together . I hate the after taste of them .	-1
This product is no where near natural / organic-I only wish I had seen the other reviews before purchasing ! It contains all the things I did not want-which is why I was looking for a natural alternative . They need to have an ingredient list on here to avoid this ... I am & # 34 ; returning & # 34 ; item . I am trying to avoid my children 's exposure to yellow 5 , red 40 and so on ... I do not understand how they can still make these things knowing what they can cause . This may be fine for someone that does n't read labels or care what their kids eat-but not for my family .	-1
Licorice is my favorite candy , and it promotes good digestion . Since I have some digestive issues , I eat licorice on a regular basis . I 've tried basically every brand . I bought this because it 's advertised as soft licorice . However , it is the same consistency as the cheapest stuff on the grocery store shelf ; the difference is that this has a stronger flavor . The flavor is nice . The consistency and texture is terrible . I bought another package hoping the first was just old/stale , but the next package was the same . I threw away both packages .	-1
This is an awesome product , natural , not a lot of ingredients , good flavor , not too sweet.But I no longer love our scaredy-cat friends at Amazon ! : PNow they wo n't let you write honest reviews of the product , so lame.What 's insane is the price ! I can easily get this same thing at the grocery store for 1/3 to 1/2 the price ( not even on sale ) .But here it 's at a greatly inflated rate AND they 've made it an `` add-on '' item - shameful.Add-on is the worst new `` feature '' I 've seen in the many , many years that I 've been shopping at this site.I am a Prime member & signed up for that so I could get FREE shipping on ANY item at ANY time - not so I would STILL have to group items into $ 25 & higher orders . Pathetic . Way to go Amazon . : PBUT - this is ABSOLUTELY the best licorice out there ! Just be careful if you have high blood pressure : it uses real licorice as the main flavoring & licorice root can increase a person 's blood pressure.OK , Amazon , will you chicken out & block my review again ? ?	-1
As soon as I had a couple of sips , my eczema started uncontrollably itching . That 's one of the signs when something I eat is NOT gluten-free . Will return the item for a refund .	-1
No way would I put the vast majority of the ingredients in these 'spice ' packs in my body.. As you know the list of the amount of anything in a product starts with the item it contains the most of and then the next most etc . Try this for heart healthy , : Dextrose , sugar , salt , spices ( does n't say which ones ) hickory smoke flavor , MSG , hyrolyzed soy protein , dehydrated onion , dehydrated garlic , less than 2 % of caramel color ( what the heck for ? ? ) , silicon dioxide and calcium silicate ( anti-caking ) . Then they list Cure ingredients : - salt ( like they need more ) and sodium nitrite ( 0.62^ ) .As far as I 'm concerned , this product should either come with a warning that it 's not heart healthy or be taken off the market entirely . I 'm sure I can come up with practically the same taste without adding the junk . Do n't know if it 's worth bothering to send back but I sure wo n't be using it .	-1
this stuff is a poor example of an authentic 5-spice powder which I paid $ 1.5 for 4oz locally , despite the fact that other Dynasty products are useful such as their Satay sauce . I live walking distance to Flushing Queens , and have a good idea what it 's supposed to taste like from authentic Asian cooking sold nearby . If you want to go cheap off Amazon , you are better off withFrontier Five Spice Powder , 1.92-Ounce Bottle . BTW `` star anise '' or `` aniseed '' is already a licorice flavor , so to add even more licorice to this bottle was foolish .	-1
I was aboslutely shocked to see how much 1 oz really was . At $ 7.60 , I mistakenly assumed it would be a decent sized can . As locally I am able to buy a medium sized tube of wasabi paste for around $ 3 , but never used it fast enough so it would get old . I figured a powder would be better , so I can mix it as I needed it . When I opened the box and dug thru the packing and saw this little little can , I started looking for the hidden cameras ... thought this HAD to be a joke . Nope .. and it 's NOT returnable either . SO I HAVE LEARNED MY LESSON . Please just be aware if you should decide you want this EXPENSIVE wasabi powder .	-1
unsure if I just got a bad batch or what ... the flavor has been bland and never builds to the expected pop of wasabi ... followed the directions exactly , but just did n't get the results I was hoping for	-1
Mother and I started drinking this back in the 1980 's . I stopped because it was causing me too much pain , slightly worse than menstrual cramps . The herbs in this tea are strong . I think I read somewhere where the Senna in this stimulates the bowels to contract . This is n't really a weight loss product but more a laxative .	-1
With its new-look packaging , Tazo also reformulated the Awake tea blend . The old blend was strong , robust , and biting . It was by far my favorite bagged black tea . The new blend is weaker and maltier ; it is sadly reminiscent of standard Lipton tea . If I want Lipton tea , I 'll buy Lipton tea ; it 's a lot cheaper than Tazo.I know that many people found the old blend to be too bitter . Tazo apparently decided that they 'd gain more customers than they 'd lose if they toned down the flavor . I do n't know if they 're right , but they 've definitely lost me .	-1
This brand of tea felt stronger in the past . Now it feels more ordinary.Relative to other teas I have consumed , this one has no flavor whatsoever . It is not even Organic , but that 's okay as it was never advertised as such.I will not be buying it again .	-1
The product description says that this tea is 'slightly sweet ' as well as a bunch of other descriptors , but I did n't get any sweetness at all . I was very optimistic because I normally love everything Tazo offers , but this time I had my hopes dashed.I brewed up a mug of this tea and was immediately alarmed at the bouquet . The teabag smelled different , but once the hot water hit it the smell seemed to really magnify . But I scooped in a few teaspoons of sugar and hoped for the best . I managed to choke down about a third of the cup before I called it a day . Life is too short to drink something you do n't like.However , I had read a review that mentioned how good and palatable this tea was when combined with the Tazo Lotus . I figured it was worth a shot , otherwise I 'd have to throw out this tea altogether.The Lotus smelled great , so I was excited . I blended the two bags ( one Lotus and one Wild Sweet Orange ) in a large mug , then removed the Wild Sweet Orange after a minute . I left the Lotus in for another minute or two ( yeah , definitely two ) .The result was a very unusual , but not unappealing , beverage . Would I drink this more than once a day ? No . Was it very interesting and something that I 'll try again ? Yes.Live and learn , I guess .	-1
I got two bags of this tea in a Tazo tea sampler box.Brewing it , it smells pretty intense . Drinking it , it tastes pretty intense . A very strong sour citrus flavor , coupled with an inexplicable slightly gelatinous texture . After a few sips I decided that I did not care for it as it was , and added some powdered non-dairy creamer to the mix , to see if that improved anything.The creamer did not dissolve well in the tea , but rather , it coagulated into little clumps , making the already-odd texture of the tea even more odd , and not improving the flavor in any significant way.Perhaps the moral of the story is that I do not like orange-flavored tea , but I found this particular orange tea to be unpleasant beyond my expectations .	-1
Misleading . The reason this is cheaper than the other flavors is that this is a 12 pack , whereas the others are all 24 packs for around $ 21 . Beware of misleading listings.Also , the cinnamint is probably the weakest flavor . Even fresh packs ( I can tell because of the dates of promotions on the package they sometimes run ) can sometimes taste stale . This is because the flavor of the cinnamint lasts just a few minutes . Tasting all flavors , the peppermint by far outlasts this flavor and most of the others . I highly recommend that flavor for a nice breath refresher between brushings or just after meals.Orbit Peppermint Sugarfree Gum , 14-Piece Packs ( Pack of 24 )	-1
I received the tree today , and when i got it out of the package it had small bugs crawling around everywhere ... I decided to go to my local nursury and i found some bonsai tree 's that looked better and were alot cheaper .	-1
Well , I guess I 'm the fly in this reviewer ointment , but Dave 's is the only hotsauce that I wo n't buy . It has a synthetic quality to it and a flavor that is almost non-existent . This is due to its being made directly from capsaicin extract as opposed to actual peppers . It offers a nuclear level of heat that seems to be a recipe for ulcers in my opinion . According to Wikipedia , its Scoville heat ( fire ) index rates out 50,000 units which can be contrasted with Tobasco 's 2,500 to 5,000 rating . Who needs that much heat ? Not me or most human beings . This stuff is lethal . No thanks .	-1
O.k. , I 'm going to offer a counterpoint to all the positive reviews . I did not like this hot sauce , and I like hot sauce ! This may be good in chili ( and I will try it there as soon as I get a chance ) , but it is not a general hot sauce for your eggs , soup , sandwiches , whatever.It is very thick and has the consistency of tomato paste . The heat is derived from peppers and `` pepper extracts '' ( read : capsaicin ) .If you want flavorful heat you can use everywhere , try somewhere else . I recommend Melinda 's Naga Jolokia for one .	-1
I just tried this sauce moments ago . Someone had brought some in to work and it was being passed around . I love hot food , so I figured I might as well try it . I have not explored any exotic peppers or sauces - just the usual jalapeno , habanero , cayenne , and other ordinary peppers . I 'm no expert and would never claim to be , just to be clear . My initial impression of this sauce was `` yuck '' because it was so bitter and metallic and unpleasant to me . It is hot , yes , but not OMG-I'm-dying hot . Just ... hot , and with a flavor-if you can call it that-I would not want on my food . Also , the heat lasted only about five minutes or so , without me even drinking anything .	-1
Buyer Beware Please ! This sweetener is not for everybody . Maltitol is an alcohol sugar and can be undigestible in the body . You will know a short time after consuming it if you are one of the unsuspecting many who can not digest it by the extreme intestinal bloating and cramping and massive amounts of gas a person can experience . Nausea , diarrhea & headaches can also be experienced . I learned my lesson the hard way years ago when I fell in love with the sugar-free chocolates suzanne sommers used to sell . I thought I 'd found sugar-free chocolate nirvana at first taste but the bliss was short lived when the terrible side effects of maltitol kicked in . The discomfort was unlike anything I had ever felt before . I blew up like a balloon and had very painful abdominal cramping . As the symptoms passed , this too was very unpleasant . Though hard for me to believe a low calorie sweetener could be the culprit , all symptoms were gone when I stopped eating the chocolate . My hunch it had something to do with the maltitol were unfortunately confirmed for me about a year later when I purchased some delicious sugar-free popcorn at my local market . The taste was amazing and while I was looking at the label wondering what could possibly make this yummy , new sugarfree treat taste so good , my heart sank when I followed the little asterisk next to sugarfree sweetener* down to the very bottom of the label and read `` maltitol '' in tiny little letters ! Thank goodness I 'd eaten only a little . I still ended up with all the same side-effects but for a much shorter duration . Some people can use maltitol to their heart 's content but others , like me , can have a bad reaction to it . In case you 're like me , ... it 's not you ... it 's the maltitol !	-1
Perhaps the best coffee is in the US if this is any example . Not really fond of chickory but felt it was worth the try . Does n't taste like coffee to me - but maybe should be called something else - something weak and not flavorful .	-1
I did not feel this was a good product it just seemed to make everything I used it on runny might be good for soups but thats about all in my opinion .	-1
When I was incarcerated in a Mexican prison , this was the only drink in the joint . We had to fix it with goat 's milk and heat it over an open flame in the yard . The taste is awful . It 's not pleasing like the thick , hot Chocolate found in Madrid .	-1

I got this a few months ago with high hopes but it was barely OK , kind of grainy , did not dissolve in milk .	-1
For quite some time , I have been using different types of hot sauce on different types of food . Before I started doing this , I only ever remember using hot sauce on barbeque sandwiches . Even though I have tried numerous types of hot sauce during this period , El Yucateco has set itself apart from the others as being one that I do not care for . It is overpoweringly hot -- with a searing heat -- and has an odd , unenjoyable flavor . Although not a terrible hot sauce -- I consumed the entire bottle -- El Yucateco is a hot sauce that I am glad that I tried , but it just is not my thing .	-1
This was by far my favorite hot sauce until the University of Nevada at Las Vegas released a study identifying this brand as having 0.21 PPM of lead in it along with others - FDA limit for lead in food is 0.1 PPM . It got some publicity so do a search for `` hot sauce lead '' to read up . Aside from the lead , the use of artificial colors also bugged me . The study concludes that simple adjustments to the manufacturing process , such as washing the peppers , or not using salt from the earth , but rather the sea could remedy the problem altogether . If they 're not even washing the peppers before processing them , then they are probably covered in pesticides as well .	-1

Low quality and low flavor hot sauce ... .not all that hot either.If you need some hot sauce and have nothing else around , then this will do , but that there are so many other choices , this is the worst choice to make . Even regular tobasco sauce is much much better.I can only describe it as being similar to watery taco bell sauce.I would recommend Frontera Hot Sauce , Tobasco , or Cholula Hot sauce over this .	-1
I would have liked these if the seller had taken better care of the product or maybe it was that one unseasonably warm spring day in San Francisco ... The tin is large and comes with a card describing each kind of chocolate .	-1
If you think your going to get that awesome full flavor and aroma you bought in a coffee shop in Kona forget it . If you add the cost of this stuff ( Hawaii Rosters ) you can do better . It 's just OK and is not worth the price IMO .	-1
i had always heard about kona coffee and finally decided to try it.these beans were dry with no noticeable oil.as such the coffee was bland and lifelessi havent tried kona coffee since ; good luck ! ! ! 2/5	-1
This product is very misleading . The bottle states it is pure vanilla bean paste when in fact it is sugar , water , vanilla extract and a thickener added to it . The result is a very sweet vanilla flavored sugar paste . This is not usable for all cooking and absolutely can not be used for anyone prepping food/drinks for someone with blood-sugar issues . This product should be removed from Amazon until the description is updated with the exact ingredients along with its nutritional information .	-1
i used to buy these all the time , but I moved and could no longer find them at the grocery . I was excited to see them on amazon warehouse deals , but they arrived very stale . Maybe I just do n't get warehouse deals and it was supposed to taste horrible ? That seems wrong . Also somewhat different flavor and packaging than I remember years ago at the grocery .	-1
Imagine the horror my son felt as he unwrapped his Christmas present to find this bloody carcass instead of a plush toy . It is NOT fuzzy although it is pink ... .sorta . More like a greenish red color . There was a stench too ! Now THIS after Hostess took away his twinkies ( Amazon has been wheeling & dealing in $ 500 a box Twinkies , so they must be in cahoots with Hostess ) . This has contributed to his anxiety , which means MORE XANAX to tone that boy down . Very very hard for a 42 yr. old boy to deal with ! He did say , however , that it DOES taste like chicken . An icy cold glass of Tuscan milk makes it perfect .	-1
I 'm hopping mad just seeing this . We should all paws for a second , and lettuce think about this . Would n't you really just rather have a chicken ? I 'm all ears if someone disagrees .	-1
So I thought fresh meant I could eat it out of the box , much like I would fresh apples and pears . Apparently not . After devouring three pounds of fresh whole rabbit out of the box , I have spent the last week in the hospital . Be sure to read the instructions . Apparently you have to cook the rabbit .	-1
Well , I ca n't speak for others who may have had a different experience , but myFresh Whole Rabbitdid NOT arrive whole . No head , no entrails , no paws . For just a few dollars more I could have purchased a fully intact one at my local pet store . Granted , I did go with the `` Buy it Used '' option , to save a few bucks , which may account for some of the wear-and-tear . Buyer beware .	-1
Decent texture and freshness but there is a noticeably industrial taste and aroma . Will not buy again - bargain or not.Returned them and bought Twizzlers which are reliably the better red licorice .	-1
I 'm a tea LOVER . I hate to bring the reviews down here , but I could n't passed the intense sour taste . Sorry , tea .	-1
This may be good for you but it taste awful to me ! Wo n't be buying this again . Very yucky taste ! !	-1
Stale , tastless crap . Dont bother . The hassle to return is riduclous , you have to pay and it has to be thrown out anyway , Why put customer thru all this for cheap little item .	-1
I read where Dandelion tea could help with weight loss . Whether or not that is true I ca n't atest . After reading some of the potential side affects of drinking dandelion tea , I decided it was not for me and tossed it out .	-1
I bought this on a lightning deal and am very disappointed . If you want ( bagged ) high quality chamomile tea , stick to all-flowers , high-quality potent Traditional Medicinals brand . This produced-going by their exact instructions and a couple of variations-a browner tea than pure chamomile flowers produce ( darker in this case does NOT mean potent-chamomile is golden and it should only ever become a more saturated yellow if steeped at rich concentrations , never even approaching brown or apple cider type coloration ) , and just as crucially it tasted more twiggy and was far less aromatic with nearly none of the sweet apple-cherimoya tastes than any good chamomile.While I do tend to brew loose tea & am ; picky about the actual bags used by any given brand ( chemical bleaching will destroy all tea ) , bags are nearly essential when my time to get tea is limited to pouring water over the tea and covering it to steep at my work area and another ten seconds to squeeze the bag out and toss the tea . Still , I wo n't be taking this anywhere-the two unused boxes will go to a food bank since I 'm sure someone will appreciate it if only as something hot and free of caffeine . Frankly , Celestial Seasonings makes tea better than the two Alvita single-ingredient options I purchased.One thing I tend to do with every new tea try is analyze the actual tea itself , always wet but often dry as well . This one 's prominence of stems ( a 1.5cm one punctured the bag in pushing out the liquid with a spoon against the little ramekin lid I cover my cups with ) , the dusty brown flecks of what I presume are chamomile flowers-very poorly handled ones ! -and the end result leave me writing a review urging you to go elsewhere . If you want bagged tea , Traditional Medicinals ' chamomile -- which is all flower , twice as flavor ( and nutrient ) -rich as Alvita gram for gram , and can be steeped essentially indefinitely ( til the bag breaks down ) without becoming bitter , which is true of nearly all pure chamomile ( that is n't treated with pesticides or in treated bags etc ) , especially Egyptian varieties -- is so far the best I 've found . Two bags of this can not compete with ONE of theirs and if you steep Alvita beyond a few minutes your tea will be bitter and woody-tannins and other bitter components are from the stems , not the flower.If you are able and willing to do the extra minute of work , getting loose WHOLE Egyptian chamomile flowers whose quality you can visibly assess ( including how long they 've been sitting around ) is by far your best bet-cheapest , too , and a Chinese tea gallery can sell you a cute little handled double-layer mesh strainer for a few dollars-I personally use my Pyrex measuring cups to steep so I can easily pour the golden ( in this case-iodine red or kiwi green or whatever other shade it turns out ) liquid into my drinking vessel and if the ingredients are suited to multiple steepings like oolong or pu'ehr steep again without too much awkwardness.The tl ; dr essence of this : look elsewhere-this is extremely poor chamomile , whether you ask me , a diligent grower , or an expert-this is not advertised as twiggy tea ( it 'd be the wrong component anyway ) and you likely are n't looking for an infusion from taking boiling water to hay-like splintery stems . For shame , Alvita . For shame.Try this instead : [ [ B0009F3PM6 : Traditional Medicinals Organic , Chamomile , 16-Count Boxes ( Pack of 6 ) ] ] You wo n't regret it .	-1
I have some digestive issues and this tea did not do trick . A little disappointed . Do n't waste your money on it . Tastes so so .	-1
if you have misgivings about magnesium stearate , do n't buy this product . it 's a white powder packed with the tea bags that you need to do your research on before you decide about it . i have decided against it after reading various diverse views .	-1
I love parsley and add it to my cooking all the time . I thought I 'd like this tea but unfortunately , I was mistaken .	-1
I did n't have such luck with this product as the other reviewers -- unfortunately I got SEVERE abdominal cramps the few times I tried it . Still , it 's worth a try because it works for many people . Just bear in mind that if you get some bad cramping , you are probably sensitive to SENNA , the active ingredient in the tea . So stay away from other SENNA products , too . ( usually labeled `` Stimulant Laxative . `` ) So what works for me ? Lots of the high-fiber foods every day . Plenty of raw fruits ( except banana ) and vegetables ( two raw carrots a day works wonders ! ) Whole grains every day makes a big difference -- I especially like brown rice and oatmeal . Apples are yummy : I eat one every day . Eating beans and legumes is also very helpful . Buy some dried lentils -- they cook the fastest -- and google some soup recipes . And keep products made with white flour to a minimum.In the worst case scenario , try plain old water . Both ways.Nature is great .	-1
I hate the new version which is watered down with chamomile and not effective at all ! The previous senna one was extremely effective but NO longer available at all . I stopped buying it as soon as the company added chamomile and it is now useless . Why do companies change something that already worked in the freakin first place . What a shame . The box they show on this is the old one but I bet if I ordered it they would send me that crappy new stuff . Also Amazon needs to offer a Zero star option as that is what I would give this new version-a big fat zero .	-1
This is refined not unrefined . How amazing , the seller will not provide the proper images of the product after complaint . I had to return due to misrepresentation by the seller.Spectrum is an organic producer which sells refined as well as unrefined VCO in many different labellings , different containers , glass to plastic . Spectrum VCO are identified as Essentials but for cooking it is identified as Naturals.I use VCO in the mix for my hair , shaving cream , soap , hand lotion , face lotion , body lotion , tooth paste as well as I make popcorn and consume it straight out of the jar for its nutrients . Years ago , I was able to get raw , hand pressed coconut oils from fresh coconuts from Mexico produced right here in US but due to popularity of VCOs , many producers have been creative in making money by misleading shoppers as well as many misleading reviews by shoppers certainly has hyped the business of VCO to another level . Extra Virgin Coconut Oil is a lie since Extra Virgin applies only to olive oil and infact the VCO market has become so saturated that many producers are removing extra from their labeling and calling it virgin coconut oil , no more extra virgin . In Canada where the best VCOs are produced , it is illegal to even use the term , extra virgin for coconut oil but in US the laws are very relaxed . There is no Extra Virgin coconut oil , only virgin , there is no pure , no # 1 , no 100 % , no premium liquid , or any of those terms used for coconut oils . There is no coconut oil especially produced for beauty product which is any different than for cooking or consumption either as a salad dressing or right out of the jar with a spoon . The higher the grade , the higher the nutrients , everything else are marketing tools to sell coconut oil for more money.REFINED or UNREFINED : The decision to choose between refined vs. unrefined is dependent upon the intention or use of the oil . Unrefined coconut oil has a smoke point of 280 degrees Fahrenheit , whereas , refined coconut oil 's smoke point is 365 degrees Fahrenheit making it great for high heat cooking or saut & eacute ; ing.GRADE A : Unfiltered , Fair Trade , Certified organic by the USDA , Canada Organic , BC Certified Organic , Ecocert , first pressed VCO and Kosher . Hand pressed and cold-pressed to produce raw oil from fresh coconuts in as little as two hours.GRADE B : Unfiltered , Fair Trade , Certified organic by the USDA , Kosher , cold-pressed from fresh coconuts . Unknown if first pressed , Not Ecocert , Not raw oil produced in couple hours or less like Grade A.GRADE C : Unfiltered , Certified organic by the USDA , Kosher , cold-pressed from fresh coconuts . Unknown if first pressed , Not Fair Trade , Not Ecocert , Not raw oil produced in couple hours or less like Grade A.GRADE D : Unfiltered , Certified organic by the USDA , Kosher , cold-pressing/expeller pressing . Unknown if first pressed , Not Fair Trade , Not Ecocert , Not from fresh coconuts but from copra , Not raw oil produced in couple hours or less like Grade A .	-1
I had read in a health magazine that Fenugreek was a product that could help enlarge the breasts . I did n't even get to a point with prolonged use to dicover if that was true because these pills had such a funny taste to them , and if you do n't eat right away or right before you feel very sick , and still , sometimes after eating you 'll feel sick . Purhaps it was the size or the dose	-1
I was taking Fenugreek along with Alfalfa and mothers milk tea for months to increase my supply and I the combo had . Then my baby became very gassy and making our lives miserable . I suspected everything from my food to the supplements . I tried cutting different foods then reintroducing them and no change . Finally I decidedvto read up in the supplements and found that in 20 % of babies Fenugreek causes gas and/or fussiness.So the next day I stopped taking it . Now 1 week has passed and not only has my baby 's gassiness gone away I oddly feel that I have more milk.I 'm sure this works for some so ca n't say it 's bad . Just be aware that this can happen .	-1
Since I 'm on a limited income , I look for the best price I can get , and I make a lot of things from scratch . Also , I love sugar-free `` jello '' , and that is a primary reason I have gelatin , although I do use it for some other things . This looked like a quality product at a good price . Boy , was I wrong ! To get anything to set up , it takes at least DOUBLE the amount of gelatin than it does with Knox gelatin . So much for savings . It does not dissolve to a clear solution , but has a brownish tinge to it . This may be okay for things that have enough color to mask it , but not for light stuff . If you use enough to get your solution to jell , the texture is poor and rubbery . Frankly , I can find nothing whatever to recommend this product . I 'm going back to Knox .	-1
First let me just say..I thought about this before I wrote this review , after taking things into consideration I decided since my satisfaction was a total disregard in the first place I think I should warn people prior to their purchase.when I received my package EVERYTHING in the box was dripping in honey & might I add ( ( NOT CHEAP ) ) honey at that ! ! I bought 2 jars of this honey & they were both destroyed when they came . The boxes of Tea I purchased were also in the box with the jars & were sloshing in the broken glass jars of honey as well..Why buy glass jars of anything if it comes busted ? ? ? I have purchased many items on Amazon that were glass & always they were wrapped specially for protection against the rough treatments in transit . This time however ? it was rolling around loose DUH ! ! ! ! you do NOT insert 2 glass jars together in a big box & expect them to arrive in tact I mean how dumb ! ! ! it was so gross I couldnt salvage anything but the honey soaked tea boxes . Needless to say I wont be buying from this company again , I know who I can safely buy from..those sellers that take extra care in the shipping process . OUT $ 45.57 & one BIG FAT STICKY MESS ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! !	-1
Honey is a good wholesome food , problem is if its shipped in glass , its bound to get broke , which it was , so naturally i hate to waste any thing , i heated it up filtered the glass out of it , but i know it now was just like store bought , had to heat it , , , ,	-1
I was really excited to try these lollies . Do n't be . Most of the flavors taste nothing like their names . They are overpriced and extremely poorly packaged . If you think you are going to get some nice thing like the picture shows , GUESS AGAIN ! They arrive dumped in a plastic bag , which has been dumped in a box and dropped from a great height . For the kind of shipping they want it would be reasonable to expect a better presentation . These do last for a long time , which is n't really a plus since the flavors are nasty . If only they could get together with the people that make Jelly Belly and get some flavoring from them ... ..	-1
I saw this listed as purchased items to review . We never got this item though ! Not sure why it 's listed here and if we did indeed buy it , where it is !	-1
This Thanksgiving I went to my sisters , she made gravy with Zanthan Gum . Shortly after sampling the gravy I had a severe toxic reaction ; my face looked like a puffer fish , my heart was racing , vertigo , my tongue started to swell , I developed sepsis and my lungs partially collapsed.The packaging does not provide any guidance or black box warning ( as it should ! ) about the severe toxicity if used in quantities greater than .5 % of total volume of food or liquid . The manufacturer is negligent and even deceptive in marketing this manufactured product as if it were all natural.Xanthan gum is a largely indigestible polysaccharide that is produced by bacteria called Xanthomonas Camestris . Manufacturers place the bacteria in a growth medium that contains sugars and other nutrients , and the resulting product of bacterial fermentation is purified , dried , powdered , and sold as xanthan gum . ( Makes you wonder who first thought to put it in food , does n't it ? ) In other words , xanthan gum is an industrial processed product -- It is a polysaccharide produced by a biotechnological fermentation process -- a chemical . There is nothing natural about xanthan gum.Certainly never mix or serve to small children until the dangers are fully explained by the FDA 's ongoing investigations . Currently , there are on-going lawsuits as a result of Xanthan Gum being added to baby formula to thicken it , the babies intestines developed holes and collapsed , resulting in deaths.FDA has issued new cautions and studies as to this food additive 's safety . It certainly should not be sold in bulk giving the appearance that it is a flour of some type very misleading and possibly deadly . We 'll likely all hear more soon on this issue - just be cautious and know what and how much you are putting into your food and body - or your family's.One lesser-known use of xanthan gum is in the oil industry . As a thickener , it can be added to drilling fluid or drilling mud to improve its function . Drilling fluid serves several purposes , including cooling the drill bit , providing hydrostatic pressure , and helping to lift solids out of the borehole and keeping those solids in suspension when drilling stops.Gluten-free is not the same food just without Gluten , something else is added in it 's place . FInd out what and how safe it it is - better yet , just avoid any foods with Gluten if you do have Celiac 's disease . Shortcuts are rarely quite as simple as them may seem in my experience .	-1
I gave this one star because of the price and the fact that the pouch it come in is not resealable . I found and bought a 1 pound resealable bag on Amazon for 16 dollars vs just 4 ounces here for 11 . I wish I had of researched more before my purchase of this . Look before you leap .	-1
Was hoping for malty flavor but not so sweet as malted milk powder . Does n't taste like much of anything . Better than Horlik 's though . Been using it in smoothies and shakes .	-1
I was looking for an alternative to malted milk powder and the reviews state that this was even more malty than that . And its not . Its gross and mild .	-1
Without exaggeration , practically every mouthful of quinoa from this brand contained some grit.After using the entire bag of this brand , I bought cases of two other brands for comparison . I encountered no grit in a whole bag of one of those other brands , and only one little bit in one mouthful out of the other entire bag.I wo n't be buying this brand again .	-1
do n't buy these unless you really want to waste money ; taste horrible and trying to pop these in place of corn was a joke	-1
I tried so many different ways to pop this like I had seen on & # 34 ; Bazar foods & # 34 ; and I am not having a lot of luck . I have found a tablespoon of coconut oil in a microwave popper to be the best so far but I still have a poor popping ratio of only about 50 % . I love the sweet nutty flavor and crunchy texture but with such a large % of un-popped berries it is not really cost effective . I may give it a try again this summer as I purchased some seed to plant and will harvest my own .	-1
This is not the same as Ativa Dandelion tea . This one feels a little weird and honestly I do n't suggest it .	-1
this is a bag of coconut chips . Seems obvious . But unless you toast coocnut , its really just for a topping . This is a 1lb . bag of coconut topping . That being said , the quality of the chips were ok .	-1
Hydrolized proteins are MSG . If you have MSG sensitivities or related migraines , do n't buy this . This product claims to be free of MSG but it really just hides it under a different name .	-1
I love Amazon and I buy a lot here every month including many Subscribe And Save items but this is nuts . I also shop Walmart on line . I have two windows open right now . One for Amazon and one for Walmart . I 'm looking at an 8 oz jar of Chicken Better Than Bouillon for $ 3.44 delivered free of charge to my door from Walmart . Why would anyone pay almost 4 times as much on Amazon ? ? ? ? ? I guess it really pays A LOT to comparison shop . Based on reviews here , I 'm going to try this bouillon because it sounds really good . I have n't tried it yet so just letting you know the 2 stars is because of the price ... not the product quality.Update : Bought the base from Walmart on line and tried it . It 's good but not any better than others I 've tried . I think I like Wyler 's a little better .	-1
Typical of the US food industry , they have to pack the product full of salt . By the time you you get the saltiness diluted out all the flavor is diluted out .	-1
This tastes more like vegetable base than lobster base . It will work in a pinch and it does n't taste bad , but even fish sauce tastes better than this , if you were looking for something closer to a lobster flavor , plus it is far less expensive if you went to an Asian store . It is way too pricey than it should be and is why 2 stars . With its shell , I think the crustacean escaped the bouillon pot .	-1
Very upset ! I began to get a migraine after eating this product . I figured it said , `` USDA Organic '' . Well someone is not doing the right thing cause yeast extract is on the label and it admits it is not organic , but the front is miss leading ! They will not refund your money only sent you more product . This is their email to me in regards : Good afternoon Danielle.Thank you for your email . MSG was first produced from a seaweed broth in 1908 , and today disodium inosinate and disodium guanylate can both be produced from fish or dried seaweed & # 8211 ; although typical production of these ingredients now uses different raw materials . These flavor enhancers often work in conjunction with MSG to create a more complete flavor profile.It is important for you to know that our product does contain some MSG . Although we do not add any MSG to our Better that Bouillon line of products , they naturally contain MSG from the ingredients we use . MSG comes from the common amino acid glutamic acid , and glutamic acid is naturally present in our bodies , as well as in many foods and food additives . Since glutamic acid is naturally occurring in all protein , I am not aware of a chicken broth or base that does not contain at least some natural MSG . Of course , as you can see on our label , we do not add any additional MSG to our products.MSG has been a hot topic in the food industry for years . Because it is a high profile ingredient , MSG has been studied extensively by the FDA as well as independent researchers . In fact , the FDA commissioned a study on MSG in the 1995 to specifically answer the question whether MSG was safe as a food ingredient . The study came to the conclusion that MSG was safe . Results of this study can be found on the FDA website. [ ... ] The term `` natural flavor , '' `` natural flavoring , '' `` flavor '' or `` flavoring '' means the essential oil , oleoresin , essence or extractive , protein hydrolysate , distillate , or any product or roasting , heating or enzymolysis , which contains the flavoring constituents derived from a spice , fruit or fruit juice , vegetable or vegetable juice , edible yeast , herb , bark , bud , root , leaf or any other edible portion of a plant , meat , seafood , poultry , eggs , dairy products , or fermentation products thereof , whose primary function in food is flavoring rather than nutritional . Natural flavors include the natural essence or extractives obtained from plants listed in 21 CFR 182.10 , 182.20 , 182.40 , 182.50 and 184 , and the substances listed in 21 CFR 172.510 . The term natural flavor , natural flavoring , flavor or flavoring may also be used to designate spices , powered onion , powdered garlic , and powdered celery.We appreciate and value your business.Kedra AndersonCustomer Service Coordinator|Customer Service DepartmentSoutheastern Mills , IncPhone 706-378-6561800-334-4468 ext 6561Fax 706-378-6578Email kanderson @ semills.comHigh Performance Work Placecid : image003.png @ 01CEEB65.908BAC20	-1
It is quite salty & I think the ingredients should be more clearly listed for people who may have food sensitivities.yeast extract is often just a fancy name for MSG .	-1
While this maybe more versatile it is definitely not cheaper than buying boxed mac and cheese . The only benefit you get is that you get to pick what kind of pasta you use it for . When i got this I thought this would be great to have , now i can make wheat pasta with this mac and cheese . That was the only benefit ... .This powdered cheese is in my opinion too expensive and not natural or organic or anything of that nature . It is exactly the same cheese youd get in the Kraft box . It has yellow dyes in it and all the other chemicals and preservatives ... Do yourself a favor spend the extra buck and buy the Hodgson Mill Wheat Mac And Cheese Dinner . No dyes no artificial colors or flavors . Its whole wheat pasta and white cheddar cheese . Its not half bad either for a wheat pasta but none of the artificial stuff like this cheese .	-1
Contains whey , hydrogenated oil ( s ) , and a long list of non-cheese ingredients . This is not & # 34 ; cheese powder & # 34 ; it 's & # 34 ; cheese-flavored powder & # 34 ; but even that is arguable it seems .	-1
I read another review of this product that stated that this product 's first and main ingredient is whey . Whey is a by-product of milk ( remember that little Miss Muffet sat on her tuffet eating her curds and whey ) . Whey has a somewhat acidic taste that is rather crude . Cheddar cheese is way down the line in terms of percentage quantity in this stuff . I could n't think of what this stuff tasted like until I read the other review . It 's taste does not resemble that of cheddar cheese . I knew the product had an odd taste which I did not care for . I just did n't realize what that taste was until I came across the other review . There are no ingredients listed on the label . Now I understand why most liked the product . I assume because they are used to the taste of boxed macaroni and cheese products available in the grocery store with the orange/yellow powder in the packet inside the box . And most have come to think of that taste as cheese . Finer tastes however will reject this stuff , I think because it has little cheese . Cheddar cheese is made with the by products of milk as well . The big difference is the cultures that are added to produce the various types of cheese . Plus the aging . Whey requires no aging or cultures . Another of the characteristics of whey is that it has little orange/yellow color . This stuff has food colorings added to produce the appearance you see in the bag . I read another review where the writer complained about the lack of labeling . I agree because it is important to most to know what they are consuming . If you look at the ingredients of some of the other cheese powders you will see cheddar as the first ingredient unlike this stuff . I believe the reason that this product has no ingredient labeling is to hide that fact . By regulation ingredients are to be listed in the order of the percentage contained therein . In other words the first ingredient would be the highest percentage and therefore the last ingredient would be the lowest quantity contained . I 'm not sure what the percentage of cheddar cheese is in this stuff but its way down the line and not the first . I have tasted other cheese powders with ingredient lists . Some of best are those with cheese as the first listed ingredient not the 3rd or 4th . I really do n't like the taste of whey powder . It is crude and acidic . And that is to me what this stuff tastes like . I doubt whether I 'll buy any more of this . To each his own taste , though . I do n't purport to know what anyone else prefers .	-1
I gave this a few tries and ended up binning the rest . I am not a Mac and Cheese person , I did try to roll my own with some pasta also tried with instant mashed potatoes . Worth a try in either case .	-1
I bought this for popcorn after reading all the reviews . To keep it short here , it 's way too salty , so you have to use just a little , then you ca n't taste it because all you can taste is salt . Then there 's that super artificial bright orange color which is not at all close to the color of most cheddar cheeses . Too artificial looking . To sum it up , I do not recommend this for anything . Ca n't imagine putting on pasta for mac & cheese ! Way too salty ! Ick ! I will continue my search for cheese powder .	-1
We eat a lot of popcorn . I mean a lot . We buy it in 50 # bags - just the two of us ; the wife an I. I like flavors on my popcorn , and use garlic butter , Parmesan cheese , and other flavors . This cheese powder seemed like just the thing for a great flavoring on my popcorn . But , I was wrong . I tried it once . The bag is still clipped shut in the cupboard . The texture was gritty , and more stuck to the bowl than the popcorn . The color is more intense than the flavor . I did n't find it to be that cheese flavored popcorn I imagined.I told my wife to use it up in other dishes that could use a bit more cheese , but I do n't think she is too thrilled to try it again . Live and learn .	-1
I 'm so tired of false advertising on Amazon ! And fake reviews ! This stuff is mostly whey and a very small amount of cheddar and also contains two food dies ! ! ! It 's crap ! ! And your site advertising it as dried cheddar ! I 'm almost to the point of leaving Amazon for good !	-1
I use to consume Yeast for folic acid . Lewis Labs was the best till few years ago Russian chose to play with it since it became so valuable for the production of their alcoholic beverages . After the fermentation process is completed the yeast is harvested , thoroughly washed , pasteurized , and dried on roller drum dryers . The B vitamins are both naturally produced during fermentation , and added to the cream prior to the drying process . Riboflavin ( B2 ) and Cyanocobalamin ( B12 ) are created during fermentation . Additional Riboflavin ( B2 ) and Cyanocobalamin ( B12 ) are added after fermentation along with Thiamine ( B1 ) , Pyridoxine HCL ( B6 ) , Niacin and Folic Acid . Infact what this bag contains yeast and supplements , where I could care less for unregulated business for supplements.Frontier is a superb brand but no need to consume supplements . There are other brand that they sell without fortified supplements , just pure yeast for much less in price but trusting the source is the real issue since majority of these yeast are from outside US .	-1
These are definitely not flakes but more like granulated yeast . Make sure you read the product description before buying this product ! Carpe diem	-1
I sprinkled this on my cats food to help their appetite , entice them to eat more . It 's supposed to taste like cheese . Cats are supposed to love it . They did n't . I read where some people use it in place of cheese . I tasted it . Whoa ... ..no wonder the cats did n't want it . I donated it to a neighbor who used it . She loved it . Go figure . I guess we 're all born with different taste buds . Mine say no to nutritional yeast ! Your buds may care to differ !	-1
Yeast spread today is fortified with added supplements are banned in Denmark which disallows foods fortified with vitamins unlike US or UK . Yeast comes has the highest Folate and Riboflavin 1010mcg/5mg . Almonds are the highest in any seed or nut 50/1 and highest of all is baker 's active dry 2340/5 . Red Star is the best there is and used as the yeast by many supplement companies without specifying Red Star as their main ingredients . Yeast is different than nutritional yeast . Nutritional yeast is nothing but yeast with added supplement where one can purchase those added supplements separately with the preferred dosage where they can not with nutritional yeast since it is pre-mixed by the producer.Red star Other Ingredients : Inactive dry yeast , niacin , pyridoxine hydrochloride , riboflavin , thiamine hydrochloride , folic acid and vitamin B12 . Many vegans consume nutritional yeast not knowing that the B-12 is animal sourced vitamin and does not exists in beets , sugar or barley , it is only fortified with yeast . Why consume supplements since after all these are all added chemicals when I can get the raw ingredients .	-1
I never used this type of coconut oil before . I 'm not crazy about it . I would not recommend .	-1
When searching for premium popcorn for the Little Bambino popcorn popper we won , I bought a red popcorn just for fun . I 'm sorry I did.The kernels of Wabash Valley Farms Vintage Red popcorn were stale . They were dried out.You ca n't directly control the moisture locked in the dry kernels ; only the manufacturer can . If there is not enough , the kernels do n't pop big enough , they stop popping early , there are a lot of unpopped kernels , and the whole batch burns while you wait for the final slow pops . Popping produces steam , which prevents burning . No steam , no heat control . No heat control , burned popcorn.A few of the kernels were perfect . They tasted great . The red color was entertaining . But , just a few.Try another brand .	-1
I have been looking for red popcorn for some time and when I found this I was pretty excited and ordered it even though I had to order so much . I used to buy red popcorn when I lived in the midwest but have never seen it in the northwest . I have only popped it once and there were a lot of unpopped kernels . My cheap yellow popcorn from the grocery store is much better than this . I am very disappointed and do n't recommend buying it .	-1
I bought this and a few other Amish types from the same place . I think it may have been old and it did n't pop well in the microwave . I have much better luck with other types of popcorn . I would not buy again .	-1
YUCK ! ! I hate this popcorn ! ! The kernels are shriveled up and pitiful looking and it tastes like cardboard ! Do n't waste your money . I will never buy this again . However , 'Black Jewell Crimson ' , bought here at Amazon , is really good ! !	-1
The kernels are very small , much smaller than movie theater popcorn . There are also a lot more unpopped kernels and because the popcorn is so small , it tastes like I 'm eating larger hulls because the ratio of kernel to hull is closer . This is the worst of the three Amish flavors I tried , with Baby White as the clear winner . Skip this and go straight to Baby White .	-1
I guess I didnt understand GLAZE ... thats all it does is glaze the popcorn and the taste is **off** Just not the right taste to me	-1
I wanted to avoid using food coloring due to it containing the ingredient red 40 . So I used this powder for my red velvet cake . The color of the red velvet cake was light brown ; this powder does not work for red velvet cakes .	-1
I bought this to make cookies with red color , not wanting to use an unnatural red dye . The flavor was off-putting and the color was not what I was looking for .	-1
This takes nothing like chocolate at all . It has a strong cinnamin/nutmeg flavor that reminds me of pumpkin pie . I tried one and do n't think I 'll be drinking any more . As far as energy goes , I do think it works - but I ca n't enjoy the drink enough to continue .	-1
If you like chai , than you 'll probably like this ... I do n't . I do however like unsweetened Yerba Mate , and would n't mind if it came with a more complex flavors . In the past I 've mixed it with herbal mint or berry teas with good results and I was hoping this would be one bag solution to a chocolaty version . I knew it had other ingredients other than Mate and Cocoa , but were hoping they were milder background notes than they turned out to be . After I bought this I found ( The Republic of Tea , Double Dark Chocolate Mate , 36-Count ) and it 's exactly what I was looking for , earthy and aromatic but not sweet cocoa flavors . It 's a little pricey , but I feel it 's worth it . I 'm still happy with Guayaki 's plain mate , but I 'm going to have to pass on this one.PROS : + Nice quality Chai style MateCONS : - Tastes like Chai and Stevia ( neither of which I particularly care for )	-1
The chips have palm oil , containing a lot of saturated fat . This was not mentioned in the website . More information should have been provided .	-1
1 tablespoon of this product + 2 tablespoons of water = 1 egg.There 's eight powdered ounces.That 's 16 eggs. $ 12+ for 16 eggs ... a dozen eggs are $ 2.50 at my local Safeway.Put it another way : when you buy these , you are paying roughly 75 cents for each egg.If I were you , I 'd find another way to buy powdered eggs than via Amazon . The price is just outrageous .	-1
I have no doubt that it 's very good . But I bought the same package at GFS Foods for three bucks !	-1
I did not like it , I used it to sweeten Coffee and Tea , Lemonade , it did not work , it appeared to separate from the liquids , meaning you taste the stevia first and the liquids kicked in . It just did not blend like other sweeteners I tried .	-1
The packets I received show some form of stevia as the primary ingredient , but the box shows xylitol first . I would much prefer having more stevia , as xylitol upsets my stomach after a while . The taste of these is okay , but I feel cheated by the change in formulation , the conflicting labels , and the company 's lack of response when I called them last week for clarification .	-1
I have had other stevia products before and liked them . This stuff , however , is incredibly nasty . It tastes chemically and toxic . Twice I tried to get myself to drink it and both times I opted to throw out my coffee rather than tolerate the horrid taste . Awful product .	-1
I just received my package of Stevita Supreme stevia `` sweetener '' . It is the most repulsive tasting sweetener I have ever used . I 'm sure saccharine is better tasting than this stuff ! I did a side my side comparison of Stevita , aspartame and Splenda . The aspartame and Splenda are both decent tasting , and the Stevita is HORRIBLE ! Bitter , and tasting of some sort of chemical.Thank-god it was only [ ... ] bucks with free delivery because it 's probably going in the trash or to a soup kitchen - though the homeless certainly deserve better than this stuff .	-1
Does n't taste like ginger . Thought it would save me having to grate ginger - but is disappointingly flat in flavor . In fact , it has a kind off flavor . Would n't buy it again .	-1
I am picky about my spices , and I know when they are good . This product is not good . And it is NOT a substitute for fresh ginger . It has a weird , offputting chemical aroma and flavor , and packs none of the ginger punch it should . I used it once , then dumped the remainder down the drain in distaste . You 're much better off with the Ginger People brand . ( See this product : Ginger People Organic Minced Ginger -- 6.7 oz ) That one is so good , it can actually substitute for fresh ginger . It can even be used in chai ! Amazon used to sell it by the case ; hopefully they will get their act back together soon . In the meantime , I am buying it from Abe 's .	-1
My wife and I have been drinking Senseo pods for years . We have always used the medium roast . On our last shipment we noticed the coffee tastes stale and old . Very nasty . The old pods have the sense logo on the pods themselves and these new pods do not so I do n't know what that means but that seems to be the way to identify the bad tasting pods . These are so bad we ca n't even drink them . I 'm going to try one more order and if that tastes the same we may actually quit sense and move to Keurig . VERY disappointed in the new medium roast and I would not recommend as it tastes like coffee that is a week old .	-1
The Senseo pods are no longer a cost effective way of getting a quality cup of coffee . Looking through my order history , `` Back in the day '' a couple of years back this six pack of 18 pods used to hover around eighteen bucks ; now it is double that . So I got curious and I cut a pod and compared it against the content of a K Cup - the Senseo pod contains about half the coffee of a regular KCup . This means one has to use two Senseo pods to match the strength of a KCup for the same size brew . This translates to Senseo being more expensive than an average K Cup bought in quantity here at Amazon.Maybe I got used to the coffee , but the Senseo pods no longer produce the bold aroma and taste that got me hooked a few years back ; I defected to Keurig where I found a much richer variety and I do n't regret it for a second . On the contrary , I stopped having this nagging feeling of being ripped off by the constantly increasing price of these pods .	-1
Okay , people . I just do n't get it ! How can this stuff be getting five stars from so many people ? Do they know what coffee is SUPPOSED to taste like ? Yuck , yuck , and double YUCK ! This is akin to drinking dirty water ! I 've even doubled the pods to try to get a richer cup ... to no avail . What taste it has is horrible ... not that there is much taste at all ! I will struggle through this case and never buy it again ! All I wanted was a cup of decaf in the afternoon or evening ... a GOOD cup of decaf ! Is that too much to ask ? Apparently so ! I would n't recommend this stuff to my worst enemy ! Again , I say YUCK ! Also , my tummy 's reaction is such that I suspect there is gluten in the packaging of the pods ... perhaps in the glue ? I contacted Senseo to ask about it and they would n't give me an answer to my question unless I filled out a questionaire that would give them tons of information about ME ! Forget it ! That made me even more suspect ! I ca n't say for sure that there is gluten hiding somewhere . It is only a suspicion created by an all too familiar IBS reaction.Buy this stuff at your own risk , or , if you enjoy drinking weak coffee that looks and tastes like dirty water .	-1
Recently I ended up trying out the Senseo system , and I tried it with the Douwe Egberts medium roast pods . Normally I drink cold-brewed Toddy coffee , and even though I 'm sensitive to bitterness and acid levels in coffee , I can drink that with just dairy , no sugar . I immediately needed quite a bit of sugar for this coffee -- and then I had to start drinking half my usual amount of coffee . It was so bitter I almost could n't drink it . It was so acidic it made my stomach hurt . And it was so caffeinated I got the shakes that first time.The problem was , I had no idea if this was a result of the Senseo process ( the Toddy 's cold-brew method does result in a less bitter , less acidic , less caffeinated coffee than normal ) or the coffee brand . So , I ordered the EcoPad refillable pods ( 2 to a pack , very inexpensive ) and tried it with the same coffee I use with the Toddy . It tasted slightly weak , oddly ; however , it was enough for me to realize that the main problem was the Douwe Egberts coffee . If you really love the harsher Starbucks types of coffees , which I do n't , I think you 'll enjoy it . But if you have acid stomach problems or just do n't like bitter coffee , I do not recommend using DE medium roast coffee pods with your Senseo .	-1
I tried these with my JV/Melita Pod unit and they produced bland , unexceptional coffee . Considering they cost the equivalent of about $ 20 a pound , you might expect more , but it is just ordinary java .	-1
Went for economy in latest order and got the 6 pack as I could not recall what Dark Roast tasted like . Counted on all the positive reviews , but we all have different palates , do n't we ? I prefer Senseo 's Kenya or Sumatra as a more reliably flavorful brew with Sumatra probably my favorite . Just opened my first of six bags , so I have a ways to go before I get to the end of my `` bargain '' purchase of a brew that is weak and one-dimensional . I guess I will have to play with the amount of water and pods as other reviewers suggest to try to get something strong enough to satisfy . Just ca n't throw it all out !	-1
I find most of the Senseo coffee products to be tasteless , maybe watered down , but not full-bodied or delicious . I have tried several different Senseo varieties , but none are noteworthy and I would n't recommend any of them . I am going to try other pod brands .	-1
I used to have no problem with these , until one day on an impulse I decided to give Target 's Archer Farms brand coffee pods a try ( breakfast blend aka medium roast ) . They cost less , are bigger , individually wrapped and produce a much smoother coffee . Now I ca n't drink Douwe Egberts anymore and am hooked on Archer Farms .	-1
The packaging on these cookies WAS HORRIBLE . they sent in a box that was to big so the cookies were flying all over in the box . They did n't even bother taking out of the original box even though it was half empty . Look 's like a 2 year old packed it . WHAT A JOKE ! ! ! !	-1
I Ordered this and waited for two weeks -- NEVER recieved it . I Emailed and asked where it was , and said if Not shipping soon , cancel it . They Cancelled it . Obviously Not in stock and this COMPANY doesnt care about sales . No attempt to send it to me . I will Find it elsewhere I guess . This was for the cannister .	-1
This stuff is just a powdery waste of money . I wo n't buy it again , ever . You 'd do better with packets of swiss miss ...	-1
When you make this kimchi according to the instructions , you essentially are letting the cabbage soak overnight in brine , then draining it and mixing in a packet of ground spices before sticking it immediately into the refrigerator to let the flavors marry . This is NOT the same thing as fermenting a batch of kimchi for days at room temperature so that those wonderful fermentation bubbles build up and render the special `` tang on the tongue '' that I realized ( after making this ) is critical to good kimchi.I also found the flavor strange , too sweet and also a little `` off '' in a way I can not describe . I did n't weigh my cabbage , but I selected a standard-sized Napa head so it had to be in the ballpark of four pounds . But the flavor of the packet overwhelmed the cabbage completely . I wound up rinsing off as much as I could , then stuffing the cabbage back into a mason jar and putting it under airlock on the counter to see if I can salvage the batch . The verdict is still out.I 'm not a kimchi purist or connoisseur , but I know enough to know this is n't what I like . I 'm going back to Sandor Katz ' technique fromWild Fermentation : The Flavor , Nutrition , and Craft of Live-Culture Foodsand see if I ca n't get closer to something I ca n't stop eating . Maybe I can work some of this product into the recipe somewhere along the way and it 'll be magic , and I do hope this is the case because I 've got 11 packets left .	-1
Great if you like fluorescent red meat you can see in the dark . The Korean version NOH sells is great but this is just bright red food coloring that looks like something a 3 year old made . It is terrible and it makes hideous looking meat that looks like something from a horror movie .	-1
this is an acquired taste . My family has not acquired it . My son suggested I call it the best laxative on the market . Is it really supposed to be brown ?	-1
Wow , was I looking forward to this after the great reviews . I got it today & made a cup right away . What a huge disappointment . The cinnamon oil is overpowering in a very unpleasant way . I can not taste or smell any other spice . The green tea does come through a bit.I forced myself to finish the cup . I doctored it with extra fresh cardemom and fresh star anise . It was not worth the effort , it was as if I 'd never put them in the cup.If you like true chai flavored tea and do not want the cinnamon to overpower your taste buds , this is NOT for you . Stay away from this stuff.Even from the perspective of the cinnamon flavor , this tea is not pleasant . I understand cinnamon is good for lowering blood sugar levels , so if you want to use this as a medicinal tea , I guess this would be acceptable.I ca n't send this back , so I 'll be using it in a pot of boiling water for a cinnamon potpourri . I would n't even mix it with my other chai teas as there is just too much cinnamon oil.Stash would have been better off just using the real spices and skipping the oils . Now I am concerned about the green tea chai from Stash . I have some on order and they noted that they included clove oil . I 'm hoping it wo n't taste like a cup of clove water.Very , very disappointed .	-1
So I order over a hundred bags of Organic Decaf Premium Green Tea , being unable to find it locally to try , and it has hardly any flavor : - ( ( ( Bummer .	-1
I ordered 6 on scribe and save but received only 1 . The box was squashed since it was packed with numerous heavy items in a really big box.I wo n't know until I receive my credit card how I was charged , but it should be free as far as I 'm concerned since I did not get what I ordered and the website refused to let me schedule a return . At least I should be charged 1/6th of what the subscribe and save price was.The tea inside the package is undamaged .	-1
This decaf really disappointed me , esp . given the other glowing reviews . It does not appear green , nor does it taste `` green '' ( ie : does n't have that fresh `` grassy '' flavor many describe as found in an authentic Japanese green tea ) . Actually , this could be a good paring with seafood , because I sometimes detect a slight fishiness in the taste . Yuk . Stash Decaf Green , the non-organic , non-premium tea , is actually a little better than this one . What people like is a matter of personal taste , but I wo n't ever buy this tea again .	-1
I was very excited to get these Tapioca Pearls to make bubble tea . They arrived a powdery blob of mess in the bag . It looked like someone dropped the bag and kicked it around until it was turned into mostly dust .	-1
I just received this assortment of candy for the second time and I am quite disappointed . The only reason that I ordered the same one again was that my friend loves rock candy . The rock candy is no longer included , although it is still advertised as being in there.In fact , a lot of the candy that was in there the last time is gone . The pieces that were full sized before are no longer full size and the candy tastes as if it was also made in the sixties and has been sitting around since then , waiting for some sucker to order it . Do yourself a favor and save your money , it is not worth the price they charge at all .	-1
We normally get Stash tea in this household , but I thought for the holidays , we would try some authentic English breakfast tea . Oh my . It was just awful . Its back to Stash for us .	-1

Yesterday I wrote to this Seller stzting that I got 4 of these barrels of cheese balls , and each one had an expiration date of 1/07 -- - seems like they went through their inventory and sent out everything that was old -- - have not heard back from them , so that 's why I am writing this . We give a lot of these out to the kids in the neighborhood as presents . Today we got another 4 from a Seller -- - these 4 barrels had an expiration date of 2/25/12 ! ! ! The need to realize that taking old inventory just to get rid of it during the holiday rush does n't really work -- - it 's going to be a long time before I order anything from them again ...	-1
I wrote a review for Sprout House brocolli seeds in 2009 . That review is below . I have never ordered seeds from Todd 's . Seed quality varies greatly for many reasons including the storage and shipping conditions and the age of the seed . I do n't know whose fault it is that my review of Sprout House Seeds which are excellent ended up under Todd 's seeds . Todd has said that he has requested that this issue be corrected but that Amazon has refused.I am leaving this review here to alert you to the fact that all reviews posted under Todd 's seeds relating to a product reviewed before early 2010 can not be referring to Todd 's company . Todd did not start selling organic broccoli seeds on Amazon until early 2010 . In addition , any reviews referencing a product bought from Sprout House would not be applicable to Todd 's Seeds.INITIAL REVIEW : I am very happy with these seeds . High yield , in my opinion relatively mild flavor for broccoli sprouts and Rita the Sprout Lady at Sprout House provides cheerful , great , fast service . If you eat broccoli sprouts or want to , sprouting your own is the way to go . Much less expensive than buying the sprouts at the grocery store and the quality of your own sprouts will be superior - much fresher and crisper.UPDATE : April 27,2011 . I had some leftover broccoli seeds that I kept in the refrigerator for two years from Sprout House . They are still sprouting well and are delicious . They just take a little longer to get going than when they were first purchased.FOLLOW UP REVIEW WHEN MY SPROUT HOUSE REVIEW STARTED APPEARING UNDER TODD 'S SEEDS : UPDATE : August 11 , 2011 . The seeds I bought were from Sprout House . I continue to buy from Sprout House . Amazon should not have placed my review under seeds from an entirely different vendor . Not all seeds are equal .	-1
This stuff is horrible ! ! ! It smells like and tastes like diesel ! Obviously not real vanilla powder . Do n't waste your money or time ordering this ! I had to throw it out because it smelled so bad . The diesel flavor transfers into the food you use it on . Totally disgusting ! I 'd like to give it a & # 34 ; 0 & # 34 ; stars or negative star rating .	-1
Vanilla taste is just not in the product , leaves a scum in the cup , not what I expected at all , back to Lorann 's Vanilla liquid.Maybe I can palm the other two bottles to an unsuspecting gullible guy like me .	-1
all vanilla powders are not the same , thought i could get away with it , but never will get this again , disappointing taste and a bit grainy too	-1
I did n't care for the smell at all , my personal preference . It did n't smell like roses ... more like a strange fake flower scent . The lotion was good ... . but I could n't use it .	-1
By far this is the weirdest/stinkiest organic product I have ever encountered . In a nutshell this lotion smells like baby puke , I mean baby food thrown up all over , so gross . It did n't hit me in the store but when I got back to work and slathered it all over I was n't so sure that the smile on my face wanted to remain there . My friend bought it too , I smelled her on her skin and in the tube and same thing , yuck.The moisturizing properties are meek , at their best . This is not really for mature skin , I had to reapply repeatedly and it felt my hands feeling clammy and stinking of baby food and I 'm only twenty six . I adore this line for all their other products , the shampoos are amazing and the scrub works well but this one item is not the best to sample . I would suggest testing it in the store to see if one can handle it before shelling out some bucks on it . I rarely encounter beauty products that are this bad , and this one cuts the cheese , err I mean takes the cake in this case.- Kasia S .	-1
THIS STUFF IS A RIP OFF ! It does'nt work , I have baked bread for many years as a G.F. person and tried this junk in my prep . to bake and this # $ @ ^ clumps into one little area and there it is ! ! !	-1
I had to throw this out because it really did n't taste good . It 's hard to describe the taste , but it did n't taste like anything that I 've had in Japanese restaurants .	-1
in an effort to watch my caloric intake and stay more or less carb free i 've been searching for products to add to my collection of foods that will help me achieve my weight loss/ health goals ... I 've tried a lot of WF products and i find them all pretty much the same ... .super fake tasting . That said , i suppose they add a good fake flavor to salads and the like , but i 'd rather just find something with maybe a few calories/fat etc and eat that than this completely chemical processed stuff ... .Good luck to folks who love it ... .but this and all WF are just not for me .	-1
i thought this would be the answer to some of my low carb eating prayers ... .but ... .sadly ... its just too much chemical flavour and not enough yumminess for me ... mixed with real hot sauce it is doablish ( thats a word ) good luck to tastebuds that love it tho ( i know there is more than one of you out there )	-1
I normally love Walden Farms foods , but this sauce is not at all what I expected . It has a very bitter , acidic taste to it . If you 're looking for a substitute for sweet barbeque sauce , this is not it .	-1
It 's not just THIS Walden Farms product , but every one I 've tried . Syrups , marshmallow dip , Ketchup , Cocktail sauce ... .. ! ! You 'd think after wasting so much money on them ( not to mention the taste that leaves your mouth feeling like a chemical sewer ! ) I 'd learn but kept hoping ONE item would be salvageable . No . They are so bad I almost considered gargling with bleach to erase the taste . There are no words for what these Walden products taste like : not any that can be printed on Amazon , at any rate . ( shudder )	-1
Give Walden Farms credit for making a no-carb sauce . It 's just a shame it does n't taste better . Still , I do buy it on occasion and mix it with other tastier sauces to lower the over all carb content . However , the smoke taste is so overwhelming that more than a proportion of 1:4 leaves only the taste of this product in your mouth . This product can not begin to compare with the taste of the now-defunct Kraft 's low-carb barbecue sauce . Mostly , I make my own low-carb sauce from scratch and then just add a bit of this to get the smoke taste , but too much and even the best batch of homemade sauce is ruined . However , if you are on an extreme low-carb diet ( such as Dr. Bernstein 's ) this may be the only product that fits .	-1
This oil has a rancid , off-putting odor that smells NOTHING like coconut , more like yeast . It also has a TERRIBLE taste . DO NOT BUY ! ! ! I consume a jar of coconut oil a week because I take it as a supplement and cook with it . Jarrow , Spectrum , Nutiva , Vitacost and Swanson are MUCH better . Their coconut oils smell really good with a fresh , coconut scent and taste great too.I was surprised because I use other NOW products and am happy with them . The quality , judging by my experience & others ' , is that this may just be a faulty jar but the quality is n't consistent . I do n't see bad reviews from the other oils I use & I have never had a bad batch from the others I have mentioned .	-1
If you are interested in using this as a dietary supplement you should buy in bulk . You would have to take more than half the bottle at one time just to receive the daily dietary benefits . This is 10 times more expensive than buying in bulk and either taking with a spoon or adding it to your food . I am fond of NOW 's products but this is just a response to a uneducated consumer demand . SO GET EDUCATED ! It is your health ! Find a much better online bulk price and buy it by the gallon or better and you will be feeling and looking better !	-1
This product does NOT decrease nor repell fleas . Also , as per my vet - garlic is not recommended for dogs . I have discontinued the product and trashed the rest .	-1
ive been using this product for the past month or so . i have 2 dogs and a cat . it does nothing for flea control . infact , in seems like they have more fleas now than before . i think the fleas love the garlic ! the dogs love the taste of the chewable tabs . the dogs breath smells like garlic . i 'll continue to use the product cause the dogs love the `` treat '' so much . but wont buy it again for flea control .	-1
One of my dogs certainly like this little tab . It has not , however , solve our flea problems.I have two terriers . One which has skin problems and I had hoped Brewers Yeast would help him out . Oddly , his tablet has to be mixed into his wet food.Flea control still has to be used . The bottle is still almost full . So I will continue to use it for their coats . But I would not recommend as flea control	-1
I 've only been giving my poodle mix ( 15 lbs . ) these capsules for like two weeks now but I 'm already considering stopping them . They have n't really done much to help the fleas and I think they might be harming him because he 's been drinking too much water . On account of all the water he drinks he has to go pee A LOT and wakes me up in the middle of the night . I 'm worried that the pills might be affecting his kidneys so I think I 'm going to stop giving them to him . That 's too bad because I was really excited to give these to my pet since the reviews are really good . Although I did see some possitve changes in him it has n't been enough to outdo the possible negative consequences . I also read that brewers yeast can cause bloating so I 'm not sure this is such a good idea after all . Has anybody else experienced this ?	-1
I had visions of Girl Scout cookies and my favorites , the mint wafers , to be exact . Well , these are not it . These cookies are simply sandwich cookies in the traditon of Oreo , but with a mint filling . If they had more stuffing they might have been good ; as it was , they were too dry . And lacking a chocolate icing like Girl Scout wafers , they leave a gritty Oreo lingering feeling after you eat them .	-1
Having purchased these cookies previously at the grocery store , I had high hopes , but the packages I received and have since shared with anyone who will eat them , were not fresh at all . They were w/in the time frame on the package and did not appear to be damaged but were just not up to snuff . Think I will stick to purchasing them locally , one bag at a time .	-1
I 've previously tried , and liked , Newman-O 's chocolate sandwich cookies but found these bland , boring and completely free of ginger taste . The texture was try and just overall the only flavor was `` sweet '' ... generic sugar taste and nothing more . Just not a fan .	-1
I love Amaranth flour in baked goods as it adds a rustic earthy flavor , however making this on the stovetop grain as if it were quinoa or millet it has an awful flavor and texture . Texture is kind like slimy quinoa , but with an very bitter flavor profile . I hope I can grind this in my coffee maker and turn it into flour as it is awful just cooked .	-1
I thought I 'd try this grain after reading about it 's health benefits . I am a big fan of quinoa and millet , and amaranth seemed similar enough . I ordered through subscribe and save and got a good price . The product is good quality and came packaged appropriately . The problem I had with it is the SMELL . This grain cooks up like cream of wheat or malto meal , however , the smell is horrible ... ..kinda musky , kinda earthy , downright off-putting . I tried masking this with cinnamon and vanilla . I tried mixing the grain with steel cut oats . No matter what , the pungent and specific smell of amaranth overpowers the taste and any enjoyment of the product . I could only get through half and bag and the whole lot went into the garbage . That being said , if you love the smell/texture/taste of amaranth , arrowhead mills is a good company to buy it from .	-1
UPDATE INFO AS OF 1/29/2014List Price : $ 20.94Price : $ 4.91 ( $ 0.02 / oz ) You Save : $ 16.03 ( 77 % ) $ 0.02 an oz for 16oz in a pound will be only $ 0.32 a bag not $ 4.91 as claimed by the seller . Flax seeds sells never sells for $ 20.94 a bag as claimed by the seller . It seems that the seller keeps changing the sale numbers in order to sell a product . Arrowhead is an excellent brand with many great organic products where others fail to produce in organic form but this approach is just misleading and not necessary at all . *****************************************************************************************************************************ORIGINAL REVIEW 10/11/2013Seller claims ; List Price : $ 40.61Price : $ 8.24 ( $ 0.04/oz ) & FREE Shipping on orders over $ 25You Save : $ 32.37 ( 80 % ) That is misleading . No flax sells for $ 40 a pound . At $ 8.24 a pound it is 824/16=51.5 infact something like more than $ 0.51 cents an oz not $ 0.04 an oz . Arrowhead is a good brand but the seller is misrepresenting the facts . *****************************************************************************************************************************MISLEADING LABELING : sprinkle a tablespoon of ground seeds ... 14oz not 16 oz since it is golden not brown.It is shame that Arrowhead with so many fine organic products will misguide consumers just to sell a product . In the beginning there was only one color flax which was brown but now there is golden as well . Usually in organic form except in supplement form , the farmer co-up flax or any type of seeds are always more expensive due to their practices which is not sold on Amazon at all . Brown and golden have the same nutritional value so I never consume one , I mix brown and golden regardless . In some cases Golden is more expensive than brown . If not specified on the labeling the type of flax , then it means brown flax not golden flax.OILS : I started consuming flax oil years ago per my physician 's advise not knowing that majority forms of flaxseeds are rancid and absolutely worthless due to oil in seeds . As whole , human body can not digest any seed that size with that consistency regardless if it is flax , sesame , amaranth , chia , millet , etc . unless cooked or in ground form since human body can not digest in its natural form . As SUPPLEMENT , TABLET FORM , OIL , POWDER , GROUND IN BAGS are all worthless and hardly offer any nutrients unless ; seeds are fresh , not old which means rancid , not in oil form , not in supplement form , not hulled , ground and consumed within few days , kept in dark cold temperatures , away from light-sun-moisture since the oil in seeds and nuts go rancid regardless . Rancid is a process of Mother Nature and has nothing to do with organic , conventional , GMO or the type of seed . Advising consumers to purchase different brands of flax in oil form or powder or tablet form are all marketing tools as well . It is not important even if the oil or the tablet or the powder in bags are even frozen at the time of production till you consume since any seed , and I mean any type of seed regardless of the type or brand will go rancid once ground and cracked open since the shell , the protection is removed and air will get to the oil of the seed much quicker than when the seed is in a complete un-hulled form . The best example of rancidity is brown rice . Place some in freezer and you will notice in few months it will not even cook since the oils have gone rancid even if you keep the rice in a sealed container , wrapped in the most elaborate sealing containers in the world regardless . Chia is the only seed that claims it does not need to be ground but that is a marketing tool just like the price of chia is since it comes from outside US and individuals without any knowledge about nutrition always associate those as superior for exotic reasons and pay a hefty price for a food item with less nutrients . I ground in my coffee grinder sesame , flax , chia , amaranth , hemp then add cocoa , isolate protein , soy milk and consume it before my workouts on daily basis for its vitamins , minerals , protein and many nutrients , without much spike in my glucose . Un-hulled seeds are full of nutrients . I never consume hulled seeds which are empty calories , absolutely worthless since the nutrients have been removed . After many years of consuming seeds , I chose to ground all seeds myself and seal immediately , kept in freezer and consumed within few days which I am very happy with the results since after all looking fit and well is just result of training hard and living a healthy lifestyle which surrounds any professional athlete or a happy individual involved in many sport activities regardless.OMEGA 3 : You will never see ALA on any fish you purchase . Infact you will never see ALA on any fish oil supplement either , you will only see EPA and DHA . ALA is not the same as EPA or DHA and it is the same for any brand of flax seed regardless if such flax seed oil is in solid oil form in a bottle or a capsule form . Greens , nuts , seeds , fruits and vegetables do not offer any omega-3 since omega-3 EPA/DHA is an animal source . Flaxseeds offer more ALA than chia , 22.8gr vs. 17.8gr . There are two major types of omega-3 fatty acids in our diets : One type is alpha-linolenic acid ( ALA ) , which is found in plants the other type , eicosapentaenoic acid ( EPA ) and docosahexaenoic acid ( DHA ) , is found in fatty fish . The body partially converts ALA to EPA and DHA . There is no proof what percent of ALA gets converted by human body to EPA or DHA . You can consume all ALAs that you want and depending to your genes it may never turn any into omega-3 . Blood test is the only way to see the affects . I get omega 3 from sardines although flaxseeds are important part of my diet since flax offers so many different nutrients.FIBER : Fiber is essential for body since fiber absorbs the unwanted liquid in the gut and body has to defecate that blown up fiber which in return lowers cholesterol , blood pressure , etc . and brings comfort and efficiency to human body unlike fat which stays in human body unless needed for energy . Flax is high in fiber.MINERALS : Flax is the king of nutrients when it comes to minerals so important to me as a whole delicious seed ; highest ALA , highest magnesium , highest potassium , calcium with the healthiest fat.Accordingly for 100gr servings size of ; SESAME__FLAX__CHIA__AMARANTH__QUINOA__HEMP__PISTACHIO__ALMOND__CASHEWCALORIES565__534__490__371__368__567__557__575__553SAT FAT34__18__16__7__4__17__27__19__39CALCIUM99__26__63__16__5__0__11__26__4MAGNESIUM89__98__0__62__49__167__30__67__73POTASSIUM14__23__5__15__16__167__29__20__19ZINC48__29__23__19__21__83__15__21__39FIBER47__109__151__8__11__4 __41__49__13PHYTOSTEROLS714__0__0__0__0__N/A__214__0__0FRESHNESS : Fresh means nutritious and delicious . I consume lots of seeds , beans , grains , vegetables , etc . and freshness is a priority regardless of the brand so I always purchase my food ingredients in small quantities from reputable sellers with high turnover . When fresh , food is nutritious and that goes for any food in any form , from frozen to canned . Fresh food is nutritious as well as delicious since nutrients give food its delicious taste . When old or rancid , nutrients are gone and any food item becomes an empty calories with no taste and absolutely worthless regardless of the brand or price , organic or conventional.FAT : The most important hormone , and the one that 's crucial for weight loss , is insulin . Insulin is the hormone that controls fat storage . A high-carb diet increases the amount of glucose in the bloodstream , which in turn means you produce more insulin . The more insulin the body produces , the more fat gets stored . A low-carb diet means less insulin , making it easier to lose weight because less fat is then stored . For intake of a massive 5,000 calories every day for three weeks with calories from a low-fat , high-carb diet ; and for another three weeks with calories from more fat no carbs with exactly the same amount of calories , with moderate exercise regimen each time ; low-fat diet stacked on 16 & # 8201 ; lb with 3.7 '' ( 9.5 & # 8201 ; cm ) around the middle where the high fat diet offered a loss of 2.5 lb and loss of 1 '' ( 2.5 & # 8201 ; cm ) from waistline . If calorie is calorie , then in my case and my experience shows that I would prefer to get my calories from a healthy fat from sesame seed and almond than the calories from the carbs in chia . Almonds have the highest fat calories from all the seeds and nuts , a priority to me in type of calories since I am kind of vegan who consumes fish but hardly any meat , chicken , pork or dairy.Accordingly for 28gr/1oz servings size of ; Amaranth__quinoa__flax__peanut__almonds__chia__sesame__sunflower__cashew__pistachioTOTAL CALORIES28.6__33.6__ 150__166__161__137__160__162__155__156CALORIES FROM CARBS21.2__23.6__33__28.9__24.6__50__26.8__31.2__34.4__31.8CALORIES FROM FAT3.7__4.8__98.8__121__116__72.1__116__112__103__104CALORIES FROM PROTEIN3.7__4.9__17.8__16.8__20.6__15.2__17.2__19.1__17.7__20For almost the same total calories sesame offers half of chia 's `` CARB CALORIES '' gain but 50 % more `` FAT CALORIES '' with high amount of nutrients for weight loss . Sesame , flax and hemp are my superfood but almonds are the superfood when it comes to vitamin E. Americans consume enough peanut butter each year to coat the floor of the Grand Canyon , priced for 1/3 but hardly with any nutrients except B-complex . No wonder Burma is the highest producer of sesame in the world . But none of those kings offer ALA and not only flax 's high ALA is needed but it balances the omega-6 which is so worthless and abandoned in all foods that not healthy at all . Flax only in powder form , ground freshly .	-1
Admittedly I like pure vanilla flavor and I was expecting this to have quite a bit of vanilla - after all it 's not called rooibos vanilla - the vanilla came first in the name therefore I want vanilla to be the high note . Well it is n't it 's more of an afterthought and quite honestly it went in the trash ! I usually like Celestial Seasonings but this one definitely did n't do it for me .	-1
The packaging was bad to begin with , it was in a yellow envelope and the box was crushed . Then the tea itself ... Well it was tolerable , but not very good . It just had this strong chemical-vanilla flavor , so I wo n't be ordering again .	-1
I have a love for gingersnaps and candied ginger . On the other hand , this candy tastes absolutely repulsive . Earlier reviews talk about rice paper and other such things , but this candy only had a weird white powdering on it . I ended up spitting it out after a few seconds . Will not buy ever again !	-1
If you want a real ginger chew buy Gin Gins . These have & # 34 ; hint o ginger & # 34 ; at best . I think they waved the ginger over the box before shipping to call them ginger chews . I guess I got spoiled on Gin Gins . They do n't taste nasty or anything just like sugar taffy . Glad I got the small package to try them . I had my husband take them to work to try and get rid of them on the unsuspecting people there .	-1
Need much more coffee to gate a full bodied flavor . Great if you 're not a real coffee drinker . Would n't recommend .	-1
When I made it , it looked like coffee -- very dark . It tasted like it was burnt , almost like they over roasted the barley . I did not like this tea at all .	-1
I bought this coffee expecting a dark roast to use in my espresso machine . I know it 's an italian roast but it 's much more medium to light than other italian roasts I 've had . The color of the beans is similar to the top of the bag ( a medium brown ) , not oily at all ( in fact , they look completely dry ) . Whether this is normal or not for this roast , I do n't know.All the other italian , and dark/full-bodied roasts I 've had have been much darker , bordering on blackish , and have at least some oil on the bean surface.This coffee brews extremely light as an espresso . I 'd say it 's nutty and a bit sweet as well . Lacks depth & complexity . It is smooth , but so is water . There are no of those darker-roast flavors ( smoky , chocolate , toast , etc . ) or heartiness.If you 're a fan of espresso , french roast , sumatra , and other bold/dark-roasts , this coffee is not for you . I wish I could return this .	-1
I have been consistently disappointed in the various Lavazza blends that I have tried . My last hotel/travel interface with poor quality ground Lavazza pods has resulted in a new addition to my cosmetic bag -- a little Ziplock full of Senseo brand pods , which are decent if not superlative , fairly common in stores , and will accomodate many coffee coffee makers . I thought the last Lavazza incident was just a bad batch , but it 's statistically unlikely that it should keep happening every time . If you have had better luck with specific blends , bless you , but I think it 's not my crappy Karma , but their crummy coffee . Just my two cents ; your mileage may vary . I use coffee to pry open the eyelids and I need to hit the ground running , so the first cup has to be acceptable . Life is to short to drink dishwatery coffee.Senseo Douwe Egberts Coffee Pods , Variety Pack , 16-Count Packages ( Pack of 4 )	-1
I read a review and was excited to try this salt . I did n't think it was anything special and would highly recommend Morton 's Kosher Salt which is far superior and more flavorable in my opinion . It is available at any grocery store and much cheaper too !	-1
As the title states - I 'm looking for JASMINE tea . this is more like green tea , no hint of jasmine . Not ordering this again	-1
These are very small and a light tannish color . They are not at all like the ones I used to grow in my back yard . I tasted a spoonful of these seeds and had to spit them back out . They were the epitome of staleness . I expected tasty seeds based on the super high price but these are a loser . I guess I will have to go back to growing my own.I put this bag of seeds into my bird feeders and during this unusually cold freeze and lots of snow there are more birds hanging around the feeders then I have seen in years . They are not as picky as I am and they gobbled up the seeds in a NY minute . I give the seeds an extra star because the birds ate them all up . These seeds are clearly not worth the price and especially not for bird food . I buy 35 pound bags of black sunflower seed at BJ 's for around 30 bucks and the birds love them . Do n't buy these stale Now Foods seeds .	-1
UGH this stuff tastes gross . It looks good but tastes more like chemicals than anything . I have been lo carb for years but I can not eat this stuff ! ! !	-1
I thought I would try to cut a few points out of my day by using this chocolate dip to help my cravings ... It tasted okay . It was okay with fruit , but the fruit was way sweeter than the chocolate . It almost tasted like a very bitter chocolate . I think if I did n't eat any chocolate for a couple months then ate this I would like it , but that 's not the case . It will probably sit in my fridge until it expires .	-1
I love Nips and thought these would be a stronger coffee flavor version . They are not . They are flat rectangular , which is not a good fit for the human mouth , rock hard , and nasty , bitter tasting . I could n't get through my first one and had to spit it out , it was that bad .	-1
I gave these several gos at re-hydrating . I agree with another reviewer that they are rubbery and tasteless . Finally binned the whole lot .	-1
Expensive , not real truffle taste , undertone of old olive oil . I wo n't buy this again . It 's much better to use fresh olive oil and infuse with truffle in a blender . No real place for this in my kitchen .	-1
Not having seen this before , I went for it , an if you do n't like the taste of Garlic or smell of it , then I would not reconmend this to you ... ..I do n't like the taste of it or the smell of it . The company did refund me my purchase price with out sending the product back to them . Never tasted what Traffule Oil was , I know its not for me .	-1
The gum tastes OK . But $ 1 for a single piece of gum is not reasonable .	-1
For quite some time , I have been using different types of hot sauce on different types of food . Before I started doing this , I only ever remember using hot sauce on barbeque sandwiches . Even though I have tried numerous types of hot sauce during this period , Sriracha Hot Chili Sauce has set itself apart from the others as being a hot sauce that I do not consider to be a favorite . Even though it is not terrible -- I used two bottles of it -- it is not something that I would use on a regular basis . As for the sauce 's flavor , it is distinctive yet peculiar . It has a nice heat to it , also -- not too mild and not too hot . I have used it on multiple kinds of food . I do not consider Sriracha Hot Chili Sauce to be a preference , but I do admit that it stands out from the other hot sauces that I have used . Actually , I rate it 2.5 stars .	-1
I was very excited to try these but it is either this is not a very quality product or I just do n't get it -- -the mushroom had no taste . I made myself one serving of a cream-based sauce for farina spaghetti and shredded this mushroom in it -- -- it offered zero taste .	-1
I was very excited about this purchase until I tried this truffle.These were horrible . Maybe I got the worst bottle they have ever sold and I just happened to get them . But , these are bad . If you want to eat the root of a dirty old root of a tree , you will enjoy these . If you doubt my credibility of my review , please feel free to read my other reviews . Please do n't waste your money . My wife tried these and could n't even believe these could be called truffles .	-1
I desperately wanted a good organic vanilla flavor . This product provides a wonderful aroma . I opened the bottle ( love the glass bottle - so tired of plastic ) and thought & # 34 ; this will be great. & # 34 ; The first pound cake I made using it did n't seem to have the strong vanilla flavor I like for my cakes . And then I tried it in coffee . No significant flavor whatsoever . I do n't recommend it and I wo n't buy it again . : (	-1
Up Front : I did not buy this product on Amazon but still wanted to let people know . I purchased a 17 oz . bottle of Kikkoman Aji-Mirin last night at a supermarket for $ 4.99 . I tasted it when I got home . Was n't too impressed . I think I 'd prefer using my rice wine vinegar and adding a little sugar to it .	-1
I thought I was ordering rice wine as listed in the item headline but it is a & # 34 ; seasoning & # 34 ; which consists mostly of corn syrup ( an item i NEVER buy ) . Rice and alcohol are in the ingredient list , but this is not real Mirin ( rice wine ) . Did n't notice til I had cooked with it , then it did n't taste right so I read the label and ingredients . I was highly disappointed and threw it in the trash .	-1
Homemade , with seaweed and smoked tuna flakes , is much better , and not much more work . It 's OK , but not great .	-1
I wanted to make some yummy miso soup , so I bought this Dashi . I make homemade food for the health of my family and guests . I was really disappointed to purchase something loaded with MSG . Maybe I can give it away to someone who does n't care about carcinogenics .	-1
Its hot stuff like horseradish is . Throw in some green coloring and VIOLA you have & # 34 ; wasabi & # 34 ; . It is obvious this is NOT Wasabi root , the original Japanese sushi and sashimi spice . Says so right on the pack . Worse is the great price at $ 1.99 until you notice the shipping at $ 5.25 making the total ACTUAL price $ 7.24 . Pick it up at your local grocery store in the Asian section for $ 1.79 . Wish Amazon would make vendors clarify BOTH cost UP FRONT instead of the old bait and switch . No sale .	-1
This product contains GMO 's Known to cause Cancer and Organ Failure , Im sorry but I will not be feeding my family your cereal anymore until you use safer ingredients . Shame on you	-1
Kellogg 's Frosted Flakes contain ingredients which are patented by chemical companies that genetically engineered them in a lab and turned them into EPA registered pesticides . That 's right , folks ! GMO Bt corn is an EPA registered pesticide . Foreign genes have been forced into the DNA which cause every cell of the plant to make its own pesticide . When corn worms bite into it , their stomachs explode . When people bite into it ... well who knows ! Two recent studies linked the pesticide toxins in the corn to human cell membrane death and the death of neonatal kidney cells . A study done in Canada found the Bt toxins in the blood serum of 93 % of pregnant women tested , and 80 % of their unborn babies . The FDA lets the chemical companies decide if they 're safe - there is no requirement for long term , independent , peer reviewed studies to test it before it gets into your food . There are 50 countries around the world that require products to be labeled when they contain genetically modified ingredients ... all of Europe , China ( ! ) , Japan , Russia ( ! ) , Australia , New Zealand , Brazil , India and more . In the US , there is no labeling law . We hit the jackpot ! We have Michael Taylor appointed as our food safety czar and guess where he came from ! MONSANTO ... the number one chemical company creating and selling GMOs . To make it worse , they have also inserted foreign genes into the DNA of sugar , soy , canola and cottonseed . ( POP TARTS contain ALL of these - do n't buy them ! ) They 've made ALL of these GMOs resistant to high doses of an herbicide called RoundUp . ( Guess who also sells the RoundUp - you got it ! Monsanto ! ) The active chemical ingredient in RoundUp is called Glyphosate . If you google it , you 'll find that it 's linked to birth defects , cancer , inflammatory bowel disease and more . No wonder everyone seems to be getting sick ! Kellogg 's does n't want you to know any of this and they have recently contributed $ 632,500 to a propaganda campaign in California , where voters will be voting on Prop . 37 for the labeling of genetically engineered foods on November 6th . They are trying to trick people into voting against labeling by telling them its going to raise their grocery bills by $ 400 a year and other things which are totally untrue . None on the countries that have labeling laws have seen ANY increase in their food costs . Kellogg 's Frosted Flakes are no longer G-R-RRRRREAT . I would n't feed them to my family ... not to my pets either . BLECH .	-1
SodaStream cola is much less weight making it more cost effective to ship . SodaStream cola tastes so great so why would you want to drink this anymore . Plus u can put the SodaStream cola flavor on ice cream & use it to sweeten your cereal instead of milk . Soda Stream has just made a better cola than Coke . Too bad for Coke . Sodastream makes machines that use the 60L carbonating bottle & the 130L carbonating bottle . I use the fountain Jet that can use the 130L carbonating tank . I like the larger carbonating tank & get a spare . You can switch the 60L bottle out for a larger one when you exchange it . Also you will wan 2 use cold refrigerated water 2 carbonate with . some extra carbonating bottles that you put water in & keep in the fridge . Also get the MyWater flavors which are excellent with seltzer water which you now will be able to make . Try using less syrup to make the sodas than advised & you may prefer that . The MyWater flavors I just use a tiny drop per liter way less than the half a teaspoon recommended . Also the Sodastream ice sticks are great & can be used to cool water down for carbonating .	-1
Being a shy , backward person , it is truly difficult to tell my story , the story of a person suffering from near-necrotic epidermis . But I 'll give it my best and relate to you the shortcomings , nay , the failings of this product as a skin treatment.As difficult as it is to admit , I suffer from chronic , persistent Folliculitis . This horribly tragic skin affliction has been my curse since puberty and only grows worse by the year . It starts with small bumps , but with uncontrollable scratching and flaking , it has transformed my somewhat-normal skin into a leather-like covering that only serves to keep my veins , arteries and organs intact . At first it attacked only my arms and stomach and was easily hidden by longish-sleeved t-shirts . Winter was a godsend , as I could slink around fully clothed and the casual observer would never know my affliction . Keeping a calm demeanor and having passably handsome face , I would sometimes merit even the occasional approving nod or glance.All that has changed with time , however . Summer or winter , I must drag myself along like a strict Mormon in long sleeves and pants , envying all other humans as they laugh and play in short sleeves , tank tops or even go shirtless.Then I met Dr. Smetigonavitadong , my ayurvedic dermatologist . He assured me all would be cured if I 'd only bathe myself daily in whole milk , preferably Tuscan . Living outside the fringes of society , whole milk would be hard to find ( even moreso , whole milk of the Tuscan variety ) , but thanks to the internet and Amazon , I was able to procure said product in the form of Tuscan Whole Milk , 1 Gallon , 128 fluid ounces . I purchased several cases.Months have gone by and , disappointingly , I 've seen no change . Pustules and pimples remain , fetid and squamous as ever . And worse yet , I 've found that the good Doctor is an investor in the entire Tuscan Whole Milk financial scheme ! My embarrassment is complete , as I 've been taken by an ayurvedic quack ! Adding insult to injury , I have an entire cache of spoiling whole milk and I 'm lactose intolerant ! Now nights are spent reading Wikipedia to learn various cheese recipes . Any help would be appreciated from those residing in Wisconsin or of Swiss lineage .	-1
I saw this on sale at my local grocery store . I figured hey its Tuscan.. it must be quality . I was horribly wrong . As soon as i opened it , my daughter started to act a little strange as she quoted passages from the bible that i 've never heard before ( considering we are not a religious family ) . I just ignored it and had a bowl of frosted flakes . Two weeks later I find her bed ridden.. i figured she just wanted some 2 % . i attempted to pour some on her to snap her out of it . it boiled off her skin . Now she speaks in an old english tongue and i can not understand her . I am now writing a letter to Tuscan seeking damages in the form of coupons .	-1
It is appalling to me that anybody would think that Tuscan milk would be anywhere near as good as good old fashioned American milk ! These colors do n't run !	-1
It 's all well and good to indulge our creative writing and have a little fun at Amazon 's expense , but what do we really know about this so-called Tuscan Milk ? I will endeavor to prove that it is neither Tuscan nor milk.Everyone knows nascut ( an anagram and almost a backwards spelling exactly of t-u-s-c-a-n ) is Romanian for `` born '' ( specifically , the past participle of naste ) . So what we have here is a thinly veiled admission that this liquid has its origins in Eastern , rather than Southern , Europe , and thus offers a flavor more Balkan than Mediterranean . Transylvania to Tuscany is exactly one thousand miles , and allowing for the fact that the earth rotates on its axis one thousand miles per hour , is it any coincidence that Lao Tzu wrote , `` A journey of one thousand miles begins with a single step '' ? As for the question of color over origin , we are presented with no less of an obvious obfuscation . To be sure , the pictures of Tuscan Whole Milk , 1 Gallon , 128 fl oz appear as white as newly fallen arctic snow . But color theory teaches us that white is after all the combined color spectrum . Given the geographical and lexicographical insights above , are we hinting at vampiric energy drinks or merely an FDA investigation of immense , nay , bovine , proportions ? Either way I think I 'll have a good old fashionedMexican Coke ( 24 Pack ) instead .	-1
I 'm here to tell everyone the truth about this so called 'tuscan ' milk.It was my great grandfather , Pasquale Iandoli who originally perfected the recipe for a full bodied , incredibly satisfying milk beverage . It was a great success in his home town of Apice Benevento Italy , and brought with it large quanties of money . With that money , he was able to act as a supporter of Mussolini . Well , I do n't have to tell you that with the fall of facism , Pasquale had to leave Italy , and fast ! He only had one copy of the recipe with him and while traveling to America it was stolen by a shipmate . This person subsequently popularized it in the states , and ignorantly claims it to be 'Tuscan ' milk , when clearly it tastes distinctly of Napoli .	-1
I mean , $ 45 for a gallon of milk ? What is it ? Gold ? Did anyone actually buy this milk , or is it there for laughs ?	-1
If I could give Tuscan Whole Milk , 1 Gallon , 128 fl oz half a star , I would . Being an African American female with type 4a/4b textured hair , I have been on a years long journey to find something that would moisturize my tightly bound coils throughout the day . When my Tuscan Whole Milk , 1 Gallon , 128 fl oz arrived by mail I was ecstatic.The packaging was flawless , I noted that nothing had spilled en route . However , I was concerned that the jug-like design would make it difficult to apply this runny product to my locks . I did mitigate this by mixing the Tuscan Whole Milk , 1 Gallon , 128 fl oz with some shea butter and left over Kinky Curly Knot Today detangler.As expected , the mixture went into my roots a little white , so I sat under the dryer to allow it to set into my curls . The initial results were shiny , perfectly clumped ringlets ! Because I am a zoo keeper , I have to report rather early to work to feed various animals before they are handled in various demonstrations throughout the day . This particular weekend , I was on meerkat duty . By sunrise , the weather had begun to cool , and I noticed a little of the Tuscan Whole Milk , 1 Gallon , 128 fl oz dripping down the back of my neck . I took it a harmless and carried on , because I may have over applied the mixture , and made a note to use less in the future.Everything continued innocently enough , however within moments of entering the cage I was overrun by dozens of the small mammals ! I can not recall what happened after this moment , but there is news footage of meerkats chewing through my precious curls ! I recently completed my second big chop , and the damage has been done thanks to Tuscan Whole Milk , 1 Gallon , 128 fl oz . I am so disappointed that I have not yet found my holy grail product to make my curls pop , but I am grateful I still have my life in tact ! I would not recommend this to anyone who works with animals , however I ask that the manufacturers of Tuscan Whole Milk , 1 Gallon , 128 fl oz create a dairy free product or something less animal-friendly .	-1
Because I could not stop for milk , It kindly came to me.I ordered it through Amazon , Whole milk ; sweet Tuscany.The driver , though , he knew no haste , No Expediter , he ! The wait : Four days , and weekend , too.It seemed eternity.My milk , it passed through NYCWhere traffic snarled in rings , Slow past the fields of grazing cowsWho nodded knowingly.Its expiration date passed , too ; And though the truck was chill , Vile germs digested lactose sweetAnd had their gruesome fill.It paused before my house at last , ( By USPS Ground ) My gallon jug ; 128 ounceThough oddly swollen ` round.My joy is dashed ! My hope denied ! Alas , milk lacks the powerTo strive towards immortality : My Tuscan milk 's gone sour.-S	-1
OK , I admit I have a serious , anaphylactic milk allergy . But after reading the reviews here , I thought this product sounded so magically wonderful that I 'd give it a try anyway.Big mistake ! ! ! I 'm out of the hospital now and back at my computer , so that part 's good . And I did get a helicopter ride to a major medical center , even if I was n't awake for it.Still , all things considered , this product was a lousy purchase . The FDA needs to put a stop to the money-grubbing corporate monsters who market this stuff . Save your money , and save your life !	-1
Texas Pete is very average . It has too much of a peppery taste and is n't really that hot . In fact , I would describe the overall flavor as bland , not tasty at all . I have tried a lot of hot sauces , and while Texas Pete is not bad , it leaves me a little flat .	-1
Texas Pete 's is the # 1 hot sauce in the South - it 's ubiquitous in every type of restaurant . If you ask for Tabasco , you 're likely to get Texas Pete 's hot sauce instead . The company was founded in 1929 in Winston-Salem , North Carolina ; their first product was their barbecue sauce , but the hot sauce soon followed . This is a basic hot sauce - peppers , vinegar , and salt - and it can be used as you would Tabasco or a Louisiana hot sauce . Unfortunately , it 's extremely mild . I often find that , in order to add the desired heat to food , I have to add so much that the food becomes watery . My scrambled eggs end up a mess and still taste bland . If you like a mild hot sauce , then Texas Pete should be one of your top choices . Otherwise , avoid this wimpy selection.The company 's website includes a plethora of recipes using their products - the Chicken Brunswick Stew is a North Carolina tradition .	-1
I 've kept a bottle of Tabasco ( the original blend ) in my kitchen for more decades than I care to admit . I 've added a few drops to any number of dishes that I wanted to `` kick up '' a notch and used it regularly in a Bloody/Virgin Mary.I 'm embarrassed to say I never experimented with any other brand of hot sauce until recently.After taste testing over 40 different hot sauces ( everyone needs a hobby ) , writing up notes , test tasting them blind again - writing up new notes and then comparing my old notes versus new notes -- -- - I have to say Tabasco 's original blend turns out to be one of the worse hot sauces I have tested blind.Tabasco 's original has only two tastes : hot peppers combined with a very heavy dose of vinegar . The bitter vinegar after-taste , so typical in Tabasco 's original , is not an inherent quality of a good hot sauce.I could provide an extensive list of hot sauces that are far superior to Tabasco 's original but here are just a few that are widely available : I encourage you to try any or all of them . I 'm quite certain you will be pleasantly surprised.1 ) Huy Fong Sriracha Hot Chili Sauce ( as potent as Tabasco ) but with far less vinegar but a hint of sugar and garlic . Top rated by many.2 ) Cholula Hot Sauce ( milder and less vinegar ) - often highly rated by professional reviewers3 ) Tapatio Salsa Picante Hot Sauce ( milder and with less vinegar ) 4 ) Huichol Hot Sauce ( milder - less vinegar - not so widely available ) 5 ) Tabasco 's own Chipotle blend ( much milder - rich tasting featuring the chipotle smoked pepper -less vinegar ) I hope I 've encouraged everyone to try a few other hot sauces beyond this onePS : Once you get away from Tabasco 's ( original ) hot sauce and what I find to be its excessive vinegar after-taste you open up a whole new world . There are so many superior hot sauces available that it is almost impossible to comprehend . Things have certainly improved since the late 1800s when Tabasco first came to market . While Tabasco likes to brag that this is their original blend -- -- that is not a `` plus '' in my view but rather a `` minus '' - a marketing gimmick where they argue that an inherent flaw ( a lot of vinegar ) is an attribute . BTW : Less anyone think I have an axe to grind with Tabasco - see my review of Tabasco 's Chipotle hot sauce which I rated as excellent ! What more can I say - experiment - I sincerely doubt you will stick with Tabasco 's original hot sauce after trying a few other brands.UPDATE -- -- - A PROFESSIONAL REVIEW of Hot Sauces has come out : While my original review was written over a year prior - just recently America 's Test Kitchen , a show on PBS , TESTED a number of HOT SAUCES.What sauce came in FIRST ? -- -- -- Huy Fong Sriracha.What sauce came in very LAST ? -- -- TabascoI 'll admit it is nice to have a professional tasting panel come to the very same conclusions I arrived at a year earlier.Tastes vary and Tabasco will suit those who like a lot of vinegar in their hot sauce .	-1
I used to be a Tabasco fan . I really did.But after branching out and trying other sauces , I ca n't help but see how flawed it is . And I think its popularity is due not to its quality , but due to it being a recognizable brand.The quality shockingly is n't as high as you might think . In fact , I find it to be quite low-quality . After sampling many other sauces in the past few months ( I 'm going through a hot-sauce kick lately ) , Tabasco in retrospect comes off as quite cheap-tasting and with no real flavor . And the burn is n't natural . It tastes `` chemically . '' Mainly due to the fact that all you taste is vinegar . And to me , that 's not the mark of a good sauce . A good sauce should have a natural burn ( moreso like fire or radiating heat ) and a nice flavor to it . It should n't taste too vinegary and it definitely should n't have an artificial-feeling `` chemically '' burn . But that 's what Tabasco really tastes like when I really pay attention and analyze it.Just to make my analysis more fair and up-to-date , tonight I decided to do a taste-test with it and some of the others sauces I had on hand . I used about six different sauces in comparable amounts . Straight to the tongue . ( With a `` cool down '' period in between so I could clear my mouth out of the burn and flavor ) And classic Tabasco was the worst in terms of flavor . I hate to say that , because I know its popular due to its recognizable nature . But it was the worst by far . To the point I almost just tossed the whole bottle in the trash , because I do n't see myself using it ever . I did n't , since I figured I should have it on-hand for friends who may want some . But I definitely wo n't be using it again.I 'm quite saddened by how poorly classic Tabasco holds up . But do n't get me wrong . I do like some of their other available flavors a little bit . ( I think their Chipotle sauce is ok , because it at least has a slight touch of flavor , though again , it 's far too `` vinegary '' for its own good . ) But classic Tabasco is just very poor in retrospect.Low quality . No real flavor . Gross `` chemically '' burn . I 'd say branch out and try something new instead of going with the same-old Tabasco .	-1
Update : It appears that this may be at least partially fixed . In my case , it seemed to sort reviews so the relevant ones appear first . However , the nearly five star rating is still not broken down by product , so you can not tell if any specific product is getting lower ratings without reading every review . The products have to be treated completely separately , and they are still not , so the nearly five star rating is useless other than to say that McCormick overall has great products. -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- The way these seasonings are mixed into one , you would think whatever seasoning you purchase to be excellent , but unfortunately , because there are so many , there is no way to know.I thought coming to the review I was reading reviews on Saffron and realized the people were reviewing completely different products like lemon grass.These reviews are for McCormick seasoning in general , not the specific product , so if you are here reading this review because you thought you were reviewing a specific product , you are mistaken as I was.Not all products across the product line are the same quality and have widely varying costs , so reviewing them all as though they represented a single product is misleading at best .	-1
Hoping to try something different around the kitchen by adding some saffron to my beautiful dishes , I used what I got from McCormick in place of saffron to everyone 's surprise . Well , I guess that was a big mistake since my dear associates who actually made it out the door without soiling their Givenchy and Armani clothing most likely ended up doing it in their fancy super cars on each other in their way to their luxury pads on the hills . Needless to say they probably wo n't be back for next week 's Persian tongue delicacy that I am preparing for them with French dressing , `` shoot '' ... Reviewing so many food items as a single item is misleading practice by Amazon , not mentioning it `` Ruins Relationships '' . Next time I am getting my saffron directly from Pampore Kashmiri .	-1
I wish I had time to grow chives ( and the green thumb ) but since I do not I purchased McCormick 's freeze dried chives . I used them in 3 dinners this week and they do n't have much aroma or flavor . All they seem to do is add a little color . I would stick with the fresh chives from the grocery since these do n't seem to translate as well as McCormick 's rosemary , parsley or basil ( which I have tried and love )	-1
I tried roasting these seeds and then grinding them into a paste to be used to thicken Indian curries . Does n't seem to be effective .	-1
Beware , the chemical poison BHT included in small dosages as a way of preserving this item.enough bht buildup can damage your body and or worse . Most countries make it illegal for companies to sell foods containing bht . the USA is one of the few that put the businesses before it 's citizens and allow for such misconduct.hopefully you will read this and think seriously about yours families health and start paying attention to what is foods	-1
The true `` original '' is the UK version , which contains malt vinegar and spirit vinegar . This product is the US version , which contains distilled white vinegar instead . I 've compared both versions side by side and found that it 's even possible to _smell_ the difference . As you may well imagine , the difference in taste is considerable.Please note that this issue is entirely separate from the matter of the high-fructose corn syrup mentioned in so many other reviews . The US version no longer contains HFCS , but it 's still not the `` original '' -- and it 's not as pungent and strongly flavored as the true UK original.Use the UK version ( with the orange label ) and accept no substitutes . Especially when they lie and claim to be `` original . ''	-1
HFCS - High Fructose Corn Syrup - is processed differently by your body than sugar and is considerably worse . Do not trust the propaganda of the subsidized Big Ag in America for your truthful info on food.You can get an organic version from Annie 's .	-1
the title of this product is misleading , because you are NOT buying 100 % key lime juice , but some mystery blend of juices .	-1
The bottle says in small letters to refrigerate `` after purchase '' . What kind of c..p is that ? The carton ( yes , I was stupid enough to buy a dozen , does NOT say that . Well , the contents turned brown and we did not dare to use them.Shame on you , Nellie and Joe ! Never , ever again will we buy from you .	-1
Bought it for a guest.Tried it , even after reading the label.Horrible.I mean partially hydrogenated oils AND corn syrup ? Generally people who purchase a Sugar Free item expect the item to be at least someone healthier than the alternative . Regardless of the reasoning behind sugar avoidance , this actually has corn syrup , which is sugar ! Making the serving size small enough so that all of the & # 34 ; negative nutritional information & # 34 ; does not need to be registered on the label does n't mean that the average person who is consuming more than 2 teaspoons of this can multiply what is on the label and get anything in the ballpark as far as accurate on the nutritional information.It is just sad ... and I hope my friend stops using this . Real cream and cocoa would be much much yummier and healthier !	-1
Be warned : although the FDA label claims `` 0g trans fat '' the ingredients tell a different story , as `` partially hydrogenated coconut or palm kernel '' is the first ingredient listed . This is a poison that is now outlawed in New York restaurants , and if you are careful about what you eat you want to make sure you stay away from this.As it turns out , they can claim `` 0g trans fat '' because the content is less than 1g per serving , but it 's a technicality : the product contains a significant amount of trans fat.Obviously , you 're not going to drop dead from using a teaspoon in your coffee once , but regular , prolonged use is detrimental to your health . You 're better off staying away altogether anyway , and you may want to do what I did and contact Nestle consumer service to complain about their deceptive practices . This product can and should be made with healthier ingredients .	-1
Too sweet , I do n't know why but it is . It 's just not quite right . It could be due to the fact that it 's sugar free and in the quest to replicate a sugar based product , they overcompensated . Not sure , but it will take me months to finish this , if I finish it .	-1
Any product with hydrogenated vegetable oils is n't worth buying . The fact that they are pretending not do have any by using a low serving size and rounding down to get to `` 0 '' grams , makes this a scam . Shame on you Nestle.Hydrogenated oils have been banned in NY for a reason - they are poison for the human body . See the Wikipedia article on trans fats for more information . Here is a clip : `` Because of these facts and concerns , the NAS has concluded there is no safe level of trans fat consumption . There is no adequate level , recommended daily amount or tolerable upper limit for trans fats . This is because any incremental increase in trans fat intake increases the risk of coronary heart disease . [ 2 ] ``	-1
I purchased this 'bargain ' size but it resists being mixed into a hot cup of anything , resembling curdled milk or cream . Since there 's so much and it actually does not have the same rich mouth taste which is why I bought it to use with milk as a cheaper version of half and half ... .now I 'm thinking as I write this that maybe if I pre-mix this with boiled water and store it in the fridge like 'cream ' that the curdled issue will not be an issue.But otherwise , sometimes it pays to spend a bit more for something known and just enjoy it	-1
I do n't know what the deal is but these small bottles do n't taste good.The Larger size is a much better option.You can always fill the small container whenneeded.Got a 18oz from Amazon and it has much better flavor .	-1

I generally enjoy strong flavors but this spice mix ruined a seafood lasagna I made a few months ago . Perhaps it would be OK on chicken , but the lemon was overpowering and very unpleasant in the lasagna . For the first time in my 50 years of living I have thrown out a jar of spice as I can not use it ; the lemon is yucky and seems very artificial . Real lemon would not be anywhere near as intense . There are many much better spice mixes available , including other Mrs Dash products- but they are greatly overpriced .	-1
I recently bought Domino 10 lb premium cane sugar from a local grocery for about $ 8 and that makes a one lb batch around $ 0.8 . That is regular powder not cubes as this one but other than that it is exactly the same . In my book for a subtle difference in shape asking for 10x the price is a total rip off .	-1
I used to love it because it tasted great and it was reasonably priced . Now the price is astronomical and the taste is not as chokolaty and too sweet.I do not understand why it is so expensive now and why it is so sugary .	-1

I order this item two times on this subscribe and save and both times I had to throw it out . The Tea arrived damaged the bottom of the items were broken and tea was coming out of it .

This is a good brand of sugar . But my problem was with the packaging and shipping . I ordered two bags of this sugar and a few other things . When I received the box , I opened it and first thing I saw was one entire bag of sugar opened and spilled all over the entire box . I like this sugar more than any other but will not be wasting my money with this seller any more . The cost of this bag is also outrageous compared to being bought and any store . I paid almost $ 12 a bag and only received one usable bag . Not worth it . I can get this same exact bag at Wal-mart for $ 6 and some change or at Sam 's club for $ 4 and change.I just contacted Amazon and they gave me a full refund . Thank you Amazon for taking care of your customers .	-1
Amazon is treating all of McCormick organic Gourmet Collection spices as a single item review . This is why one can see so many different reviews about different spices in one place since a different spice can be selected by scrolling down the flavor option ... Different spices taste differently , originated differently and are different genetically . McCormick is an excellent brand , Amazon is the one that needs to get it together . Reviewing so many food items as though presented as a single product is misleading practice by Amazon .	-1
This rosemary is okay , I guess , I had hoped for more flavor but in that I have always used fresh rosemary I do n't think I am a very good judge .	-1
We have tried everything to get even one bag to come out correctly . Either it leaves LOTS of kernels in the bag and very little popcorn to eat OR it burns in big globs and at least 1/4 is burned . We give up ! Our microwave is 1200 watts and we have tried the popcorn button AND numerous times tried other times AND we stand there and listen to it . The kernels are still popping vigorously but it is burning inside . Enough is enough . What a shame because it is good tasting , what little we get from one bag , but too frustrating .	-1
When I ordered this popcorn , I was expecting a premium and organic popcorn with low sodium and low fat . It was none of those . It was excessively salty and greasy and , for those of you who like their popcorn with salt and butter , you might like it . I prefer mine dryer where I can choose to add my own oil or butter and my own salt or none of those . I wo n't buy it again .	-1
This popcorn does pop up well with very few hulls . However , it has little to no butter flavor and has a strange taste that I could n't grow accustomed to . I ate three boxes , trying to convince myself that the flavor would grow on me , before deciding that I was never going to get used to it and the calories were n't worth it . I added butter , flavorings , parmesan cheese , but no luck . Too bad you ca n't return unused boxes ! I ended up giving the rest of it away . A very expensive taste test !	-1
I agree with the review about the strange taste . I LOVE LOVE Black Jewell NATURAL flavor popcorn so I decided to try the Butter one . It popped up fine but it just has a weird taste ! Even my popcorn loving 12yr old said something was wrong with the flavor . I ordered 6 boxes ... do n't know what I am going to do with the 5 boxes left ... maybe donate ? : - ( I will continue to buy the Natural by the case and butter it myself .	-1
I 'm a big popcorn fan and have tried many brands . I tried this one because the best , BKH popcorn has gone out of business . I like the hullless kind and they not only had the best but the largest popped kernels . In addition to that on the average 99 % popped . The Black Jewel had like 25 % not popped and anymore then 2 min in the microwave made it burn . The popped kernels were very small , hardly nothing to eat . The flavor was good but certainly not worth ever buying again . If anyone knows the BKH brand and can suggest one like it let me know .	-1
I wo n't pretend to be an expert on olive oils ; but I will attest to being a family cook and consumer of olive oils and this one did not strike me as quite what I was expecting . The first whiff gives a hint of stale and when blind-taste-tested in my home kitchen by my husband , my ten year old and me- dipping crusty sourdough bread-straight-up , no herbs , no garlic no other flavors- 2 out of 3 of us selected the OTHER first-cold-pressed , Virgin Olive Oil from Italy ; we were trying to buy more American stuffs but will stick with our imported Italian olive oils for now . OK , for me , this one is fine for sauteeing- just not the best fresh flavor for dipping or dressings . In case it it matters substantially- the bottle indicates : 'Harvested Fall '07 and Bottled 6-21-08 '	-1
I received the olive oil and no where on the bottle does it say this product is organic , and obviously does not have the USDA/ORGANIC seal of approval.I went to their website but when I clicked on the various categories , even the `` CONTACT '' one , nothing came up on any of them.Contacted Amazon about there being no guarantee this is true organic olive oil and they gave me a full refund in less that 12 hours . Great service , as always ! ! !	-1
I have to agree with the sizeable minority here that this olive oil is just too bitter ( at least the Fall 08 bottling ) . The flavor starts a bit grassy , but then a flat , mouth-puckering astringency takes over . At first I hoped that the bitterness would mellow with a little shelf time , but after year in a cool , dark place the flavor is the same . I consider myself a foodie and I love strong flavors , but this oil 's bitterness is just so strong that it overpowers any other qualities . I have tried a variety of premium olive oils from the California , Europe , and Australia and have never experienced such an unbalanced olive oil . Given the number of good reviews out there , I hope I just got a bad batch .	-1
had high expectations with the great reviews , but wondering if people are being sucked in by the old family run , traditional process hype , and a very high price- like it must be the best ; i found it flat to the taste , slightly bitter in cooking something simple , and slightly soapy even with good pasta ; good extra virgin should have a melt in your mouth aroma at first heating , a rich , complex taste ; this just does n't ; buy a store bottle at the s'market and you would not know the difference cooking ; this product does n't measure up to a good imported italian extra virgin	-1
Now , please bear in mind that taste is highly subjective and just because I did not like this fruitcake - and I 'm a fruitcake lover - does n't mean that you or someone else might not enjoy it . Here are the reasons I did n't like it : I like pecans , or even walnuts in fruitcake , and this recipe uses almonds . The almonds added nothing to the taste , and the texture was obtrusive . In the middle of a bite of fruitcake , there is a rather hard , chewy almond to deal with . Not pleasant . And there were a lot of almonds . The ironic thing is that this fruitcake is made in Georgia and I believe Georgia grows pecans , my favorite . Next , I found the cake to be rather dry compared to other fruitcakes . And last of all , I have to agree with my friend who said & # 34 ; it seems to be missing something & # 34 ; . Maybe the something missing is the alcoholic beverage flavoring most fruitcakes , I do n't know . Anyway , I love fruitcakes but I will not order this one again .	-1
I 've never tasted the Stevia powders and the drink recipe I made only called for half a pack in a cup of green tea . Sure wish I had not added it because the entire drink went down the drain . The taste was so strong that I just could not get past it . Takes some getting used to but not for me .	-1
This is not pure stevia . Buying stevia for the benefits is not what this product does . MALTODEXTRIN is the number one main ingredient and , by the way , stevia was added to it . I have been using pure stevia products for 20+ years and always read my ingredients . I wish companies would stop fooling people into believing they now have the miracle sweetener . Its just like making donuts and adding a touch of stevia ! revised review bc . I had mixed up 5 star rating of another stevia product WHICH IS PURE STEVIA ( and accidentally gave it a one star rating ) THIS DESERVES a zero rating bc . it a product with the main ingredients being SUGAR with stevia added to it	-1
Something has changed drastically for the worse . You need a lot more of this product to attain the same sweetness , plus now it is bitter . All in my last couple of canisters . Looks like from other reviews that the product has been changed . Too bad ! Used to be a great product ! -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- OLD REVIEWHave tried a few stevia powders and liquids - this one seems to lack some of the bitterness that others left in my mouth . The powder is convenient . Price on amazon is cheaper than my local health food store which carries it for $ 23.99 and Wegman 's which carries it for $ 19.99 . Despite liking this for cold drinks and sweetening yogurt and the such , I am still not a fan of this in warm drinks ( coffee , tea , cocoa ) and taste a bitterness there . My husband does n't have the same experience that I do with warm drinks and says it is just fine .	-1
I tasted this product at a friend 's house . I had to use a lot more of it than I do with pure stevia , and I realized why when I examined the product label and researched information on the product on the NuNaturals website . This product is mostly maltodextrin . This is what is stated in the product information from NuNaturals : `` Add NuStevia to sweeten your favorite food or beverage , 1/4 tsp is as sweet as 1 tsp of sugar . For recipes , 4 tbs [ 1/4 cup ] is as sweet as 1 cup of sugar . `` Pure stevia powder is presumed to be 200 times as sweet as sugar . Individual perceptions of sweetness may vary , but I personally find the best brands of pure stevia to be about 40 times as sweet as sugar . Given that the stevia powder used in this product is at best , per the company 's own admission , only about 4 times as sweet as sugar , that means that this product is only about one-tenth stevia.For my own consumption , I much prefer to purchase100 % pure stevia powder . I 'm not a fan of maltodextrin mixed with stevia , and certainly not of natural flavors added to any food I consume which are , for reasons unknown , added to this product . I explain what those ingredients are below.Ingredients : Maltodextrin , stevia extract and natural flavors . Free of soy , MSG , yeast , gluten , wheat , milk , synthetics , artificial colors or flavors , preservatives , saccharin , aspartame , sucralose , or artificial sweeteners.Maltodextrin : This is a food additive that is either without taste or slightly sweet . It is commonly used in the processed-food industry as a thickener or filler , to improve the texture and appearance in processed food . As a relatively cheap ingredient , it can also add more bulk to a given product , thereby increasing profits for the company using it . In the U.S. , most of the time it is derived from rice , corn , or potato starch . Through a process called hydrolysis , the starch is reduced to its basic amino acids . Then an enzyme is used to break it down even further , resulting in a powder that instantly dissolves in water . Products such as jams and powdered substances which contain maltodextrin are required by law to say `` wheat '' in the the nutrition labeling if the maltodextrin is derived from wheat.Natural Flavor : The definition of natural flavor under the Code of Federal Regulations is : `` The essential oil , oleoresin , essence or extractive , protein hydrolysate , distillate , or any product of roasting , heating or enzymolysis , which contains the flavoring constituents derived from a spice , fruit or fruit juice , vegetable or vegetable juice , edible yeast , herb , bark , bud , root , leaf or similar plant material , meat , seafood , poultry , eggs , dairy products , or fermentation products thereof , whose significant function in food is flavoring rather than nutritional '' ( 21CFR101.22 ) . That essentially means that natural flavor is derived from a real food , but the process by which it is derived is unexplained and there is no way to know how safe or healthy a natural flavoring is .	-1
I started using this stevia about a year ago and was really impressed . I just finished my last bottle from the old formula and started this new one I had just ordered - YUK . It has an aftertaste like aspartame ( and I should know , I 've used artificial sweeteners for 40 years ) . The only thing I would recommend about this product is for Nunaturals to change back to their old formula . I 'm already looking for a new brand to try and wo n't wait until I finish this one which was a waste of good money .	-1
because of the shape of the crystals makes it is difficult to get a even spread . Some parts of your steak are saltier than others . It does have a nice crunch but the taste is not so special , to my buds anyway . I prefer French Grey Salt for taste and since it is a fine grain it can be 'applied ' evenly . Not to mention the price 17 bucks for 5 lbs delivered .	-1
The taste/flavor is some too strong and some people may not like them , make take some time to adjust to that . In all actuality I wo n't buy anymore but wanted to try them .	-1
This product was fine quality-wise but I am writing this for other food-adventurers who like to try new things : this product is about 50 % nori flakes . Rather than a seasoning with just a hint of nori to it ( what I was hoping for ) , this is nori with other seasonings ( and all I could taste was the bitter nori ) .If you love nori ( or sushi ) then read other reviews to decide whether or not this is for you	-1
I figured sooner or later there would be a Tazo tea I did not like . It has an overly sweet , artificial taste to it . I got past the blood red color and really wanted to like this tea . Will be giving this to a friend who may like it more . Luckily , I only paid $ 2.99 for a box of 20 at my local Homegoods who had lots of Tazo , Mightly Leaf and other brands on display from 2.99 - 5.99 .	-1
This tea has a strong , artificial orange flavor . It tastes like Tang seriously . If you have n't tried Tang , take orange candy and dip it in a cup of water . Tazo must have been very unmotivated when it created this flavor . Maybe kids will like it .	-1
You know you are getting the worst of worst when you see so many excellent reviews written about a product that when you visit their Internet site , instead of spelling out the ingredients , publishes ***Following content is provided by Henkel India Ltd.

Henkel does not assume any responsibility for the content of this page . ***Read the side effects , Canadian warning link which is posted in the comment section . This toothpaste is from India .

I was recommended this product by a friend who had read several articles on it being a healthier option than soy sauce . So , I tried it . It tastes okay - not as good as traditional soy sauce , but a decent substitute in recipes calling for it . I used it for a few weeks before finally looking more closely at the label . Kikkoman Soy Sauce has 920mg of sodium per serving . Low Sodium Kikkoman Soy Sauce has 575mg per serving . Bragg 's has 160mg per serving . However , all the soy sauces I checked have a serving size of one tablespoon . Bragg 's serving size is HALF A TEASPOON ! This makes it 960mg in an equivalent serving - more than regular soy sauce ! I was shocked , and then angry.Every `` substitute '' product - whether low fat , low sodium , higher fiber , whatever - I have ever tried before now has the same serving size as the product it is recommended in place of . Not only is this not equivalent , it is a ridiculous serving size . I could not find another liquid condiment of any type ( ketchup , mustard , steak sauce , salad dressing , ginger sauce , etc . ) that had a serving size smaller than one tablespoon , and many are two tablespoons . Not only is regular soy sauce lower in sodium , but obviously the low sodium options from name brands like Kikkoman or La Choy are significantly lower.There are many other seasoning options that are lower in sodium than this . If you like the taste , that is one thing . However , if you are looking to lower your sodium intake this is not a good product . Further , I feel that THE SERVING SIZE IS DESIGNED TO DECEIVE CUSTOMERS , and I will not be trying another Bragg product ever again .	-1
I have used Bragg 's products since 1967 . Now I 'm questioning their quality . Feb 5 I received Bragg 's Liquid Aminos 32oz All Purpose Seasoning ( Best by Aug 23 , 2016 ) . There was liquid inside the plastic bag . The protective seal was on but when I opened the cap , there was an index shape puncture in the seal . I called Bragg and was told none of their employees would do something like that ! They told me to talk to Amazon . Amazon had another bottle ( no date printed on bottle ) shipped and received Feb 6 . ( You Rocks , Amazon ! ! ! ) The seal on the new bottle was broken and about 1/4 cup of the liquid was inside the plastic and some had leaked into the box and left a large spot on the carpet in front of my door .	-1
