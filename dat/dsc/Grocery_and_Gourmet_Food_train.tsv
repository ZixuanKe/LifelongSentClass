Just another flavor of Kit Kat but the taste is unique and a bit different . The only thing that is bothersome is the price . I thought it was a bit expensive ... .	1
Really good . Great gift for any fan of green tea ! Just so expensive to purchase candy from across the sea .	1
I had never had it before , was curious to see what it was like . Smooth , great subtle good flavor . I am ordering more and plan to make it a routine .	1
I 've been looking forward to trying these after hearing about how popular they were in Japan , and among Kit Kat fans as well . I do not recommend ordering these during warm weather , because they can melt and become smushy . I ordered mine right when summer began , and they were a bit mushy so I let them solidify under room temp . Afterwards , I tried some and they tasted fine . I was expecting a stronger green tea or matcha flavor , but it is actually quite subtle . The outer coating was creamy and not overly sugary , which I liked . Overall , I would n't say it 's insanely good , but definitely a yummy treat .	1
These Kit-kats are very good , but if you 're looking for a strong green tea flavor- you will be disappointed . The green tea flavor is very subtle .	1
Creamy white chocolate infused with Matcha green tea surrounding layers of wafers . Much less sweeter than the traditional Kitkat . Small size is perfect to satisfy the chocolate craving w/o the guilt . Was in LA last week and picked up a bag on a whim at the Japanese store in Little Tokyo . Now , back in WI and regretting not picking up a handful more . Not only were these Kitkats delicious , the bags were only $ 5 each !	1
After hearing mixed opinions about these Kit Kats , I decided to try them . They are excellent , and I do not regret purchasing them at all . They taste like matcha with a bit of a vanilla and milky flavor as well . They are not too sweet or too plain . These are the best Kit Kats I 've ever had , and I would recommend them to anyone who likes matcha-flavored candies or anyone wanting to try an unusual kind of Kit Kat .	1
I ordered these in Summer so they of course arrived melted , a trip the freezer made them awesome again though . Just order them in cooler times of the year and you should get them in good condition.I love these so much more than the regular chocolate Kit-Kat bars . I hope some day to see them on store shelves in the US some day .	1
These are definitely THE BEST candy bar out there ! I just wish I was able to find them in a local store instead of having to buy them online !	1
Yes - this is one of the most expensive candies around , because it only comes imported . But my goodness - are these ever good . The KitKat folks could really clean up if they started selling these in the US . Once you try them you ca n't wait for more . So yummy and delivered quickly and fresh .	1
I love the green tea kitkat , taste so good , not as sweet as the milk chocolate one , and it comes with 12 small pack , easy to keep on a diet , i love this one and the dark chocolate one !	1
I tried this for the first time today and it is delicious but I do n't quite taste the Matcha flavor as you would in like say a Green Tea ice cream . To me it tasted like white chocolate with a grainy texture which I 'm guessing is the Matcha tea powder . I think my favorite KitKat flavor mix is the Mocha .	1
This curry paste makes a delicious curry . I just fried up some chicken and vegetables and added coconut milk to this for a delicious dish . Quite spicy , so if you 're looking for something mild , look elsewhere	1
I 've purchased different curries in the grocery store and was never completely happy with the flavor . I read a recipe that recommended this brand and after using it I can see why they recommend this specific brand . Great flavor - I purchased all 3 - Green , Red , and Yellow curry paste and have enjoyed all 3 types .	1
I love ethnic foods and to cook them . I recently purchased another product which was a major disappointment , so I was back to the drawing board.The reviews won me over , and free shipping , so I ordered one of each , red and green . Tonight I used the green for the first time and WOW ! It made me look like a gourmet international chef - it is so incredibly good ! It was definitely hot , though , which is fine with me but I was glad I had the coconut milk base . This is excellent and I will keep this on hand always .	1
I started a new diet restricting all added sugars . This was one of the only brands I could find that did n't have sugar added into the ingredients . And it tastes great to boot ! I 'm not sure I could finish this whole tub before it goes off though . How long does it last ?	1
So many flavors . I ca n't begin to tell you how much I love all of mae ploy curries . I should ask them for recipes . Basically its a plastic lidded container about the size of I wan na say two and one half yogurts . It has a bag inside that you pull out and inside that clear bag is the curry . Its all mashed in there . I cut a corner and take out a little at a time . Having the spices mixed and its a paste makes it nicer to make a sauce and marry this flavor to anything . Veggies love it that are steamed , scrambled eggs , rice pasta and even fish and meat .	1
I 've used this a lot recently in some of my chicken dishes . I do n't use a lot , I do like spicy foods and a little goes a long way . The plus is its in a bag and you can squeeze out what you need.. Yes I will buy more	1
This is a huge step up in quality from the kind that is normally available in the supermarkets near me . This makes green curry extremely easy . It also appears to have a pretty good shelf life which is good because there 's enough in here to make several large portions , so unless you eat green curry all the time it will last quite a while .	1
I have two things in mind when I make a Thai curry : 1 ) I want it to taste good and 2 ) I want whomever I 'm making it for to feel like it 's fairly authentic . Mae Ploy makes both of these tasks quite easy to accomplish . The very best curry is made from making one 's own paste , however finding the time and perhaps even more difficult , the ingredients to do so does not compensate for the difference in taste . In my experience , Mae Ploy is an excellent green curry paste that tastes plenty fresh and will give you that same satisfaction that you get from a Thai restaurant.A few things I 've learned using their curry pastes over the years:1 ) If you are cooking for people who are not used to Thai food , the proportions indicated in the directions on the container will be WAY TOO HOT for them . This is especially true with Green Curry and even more important if there will be children eating the meal . It 's very easy to adjust the amount of paste used , and with practice you 'll learn just how much is good for the experienced palate and how much is good for kids or newbies.2 ) The packaging does n't mention anything about how long the product keeps . The paste comes in a plastic container with a lid that can seal , but it 's actually in a thick plastic bag inside that container . I used to cut open the bag and leave it in the container , but I 've taken to just cutting a hole in the corner and using it like an icer would in a bakery . I feel like the double container might help it to keep a bit longer . Once the bag is opened , the product should be stored in the refrigerator . There is enough in the container to make several curry dishes.3 ) Mae Ploy paste is fantastic , but choosing a bad coconut milk can degrade the quality of your dish or even ruin it altogether . Do n't go with `` lite '' brands , and look for something more authentic if you can find it . I 've found Chaokoh brand comes with a higher amount of cream which gives your curry a more consistent flavor . Chaokoh is the brand most often found in Asian markets and I 've always figured that they would know best.This product is incredibly easy to use and turns out a Green Curry that will make your friends think yours is good as a restaurant 's . I do n't believe there is a better paste on the market and when you factor in the price it 's a no brainer . ( FYI , If you live in an area where there are asian markets , you will do better buying it there as it will be even cheaper ) .	1
I like to make my own curry but this is a tasty alternative . I use it as a base for all kinds of different curry recipes .	1
Because of Mae Ploy Thai Green Curry Paste , green thai curry has become my signature dish . I am always being asked to make it . Remember that it is very spicy so a little goes a long way . The flavors in this paste are complex and varied and make for a delicious curry . We are living overseas ( not in Thailand ) so I am happy to see that it is available on Amazon !	1
Had n't had green curry before so I bought this to give it a try . Turned out really good and I loved the heat level I got using 2 Tbs of paste . I ordered the red paste too but have n't gotten to try it yet , but if it 's as good at this paste it should be way better than what my grocery store carries .	1
Being newbie to THai cooking , these are great addition to my kitchen . Its tastes really good for vegetable and chicken curry .	1
I have tried all the curris from Mae Ploy ( excluding the Panag ) and various other curry pastes out there . Mae Play is a solid and affordable curry paste that keeps . The Red has more heat , but the green has more spice . The Yellow and Matsaman curry paste do n't really have any heat to me , but do taste good as well.For a holiday treat , substitute eggnog for coconut milk with the green curry . It is super delicious ( just be advised your GI tract WILL hate you later for doing so )	1
I have both the red and green curry paste . The green is milder . I use both of them in variety of dishes and often spice up soups and stews that need a little zing . It is so convient to have them in the frig .	1
These dyes create awesome colors for kids crafts . I have used them to make finger paint , paint , play dough , and salt dough.Another reviewer stated that they are not natural - this is CORRECT . They are definitely artificial dyes . I tried making my own dyes , and when that fell through , these worked great in a pinch . You only need a couple drops for really vibrant color . And they are pretty easy to clean - do n't stain after they 've been made into whatever craft.Good product for the price !	1
Used for making red and green caramel corn for Christmas . Was n't sure how the food coloring would work with the caramel , but these created great , vibrant colors . ( They did darken a little after baking the caramel corn , but were still fairly bright . ) Great product and will last me a long time .	1
This is a nice basic selection of gel food colorings which you can make all the basic colors you would need for a beginner . They mix well with frostings and do not make the frosting runny as with liquid colors .	1
This are so much easier to use than the Wilson paste colors . Colors are vibrant , and do not taint the frosting like some colors can . These are simple to use , and do not make a mess . My only complaint is that I did not find these years ago . This is a must have if you decorate often !	1
If you are looking for deep saturated colors , these are the ones for you . I had to use more than I expected while coloring white fondant but the colors were nice and bright and the farm cake turned out beautiful ! Caution , wear gloves as these will stain your hands .	1
My only complaint about this product is that sometimes it is difficult to squeeze just a very small amount from the bottle into the mixture to be colored . I do n't do massive amounts of baking , and I find that sometimes it is really hard to get a very light color when adding this product to very small quantities of mixture . However , the colors are very bright and I was very pleased to find that the color is evenly distributed throughout the mixture . I thought this product was a little pricy , but after trying it out , I do believe that it was worth the extra money . The product seems of high quality and it shows in my cooking whenever I want to add some color to things .	1
I really enjoy these bars as a quick breakfast , lunch , or pre-workout snack . I need something quick in the mornings and this does the trick . They fill me up better than other bars on the market and I am a big fan of the taste . I do eat alot of different meal and energy bars over the course of the week but I think these are my favorite . I have been using subscribe and save for several shipments and I have never had a problem with old or stale items . And Amazon seems to be much cheaper than buying individual bars at the grocery store .	1
Frankly , I was worried about buying these on line because I have heard stories about getting expired food . However , these came in and were very fresh , so I am happy and would buy again.The taste is good . But more importantly they are very filling , especially is you eat it with a full glass or water.This is one of the most healthy bars available .	1
I have to watch what I eat as I am diabetic . As a result I can experience low blood sugars especially when I do a lot of yard work , exercise a lot or ride my bike . I always carry one of these with me as an emergency booster to make sure that I have the energy to continue or to raise my blood sugar when I need it.We tried many types of energy bars and to me so many tasted like cardboard . If it does n't taste good then why eat it ? To me this is the best energy bar that I have tried and I like that it is helping me while I enjoy eating it . They do contain a lot of calories and sugar so I only use them when I really need to have the boost . I also carried them when I used to travel all of the time and I got off schedule with my meals because of time zones and long flights.Nutrition data for the oatmeal raisin cookie flavor : * Calories 250* Calories from fat* Total fat 5 grams* Saturated fat 2 grams* Trans fat 0* Cholesterol 0* Sodium 140 mg* Potassium 200 mg* Total carbohydrates 43 grams* Dietary fiber 5 grams* Sugars 22 grams* Protein 10 grams* It also includes Vitamins C and B6 , calcium , iron thiamin and riboflavin . * I wish that foods sold online always posted the nutrition labels and the ingredients so you could check for allergies and sugars.The only down side for me is that if I am bike riding for example and it gets hot then the icing coating on the bottom gets soft and can be messy so I just eat them out of the wrapper . I still like them and I use them all the time when I need the boost . This is a good product and I recommend it .	1
I make no claims to sports nutrition ( or any nutrition for that matter ) expertise , so I 'll just call it a snack , and leave its place in your exercise program between you and your personal doctor/nutritionist/coach/guru . However , I will say that this is a much better than average tasting sports bar/snack ( name your preference ) , free of the cardboad-ish and stale texture and barely identifiable aftertastes common to similar products.While noone will compare this to a real apple crisp , this convenient food for those on the go has recognizable tastes of oats ( this flavor and texture predominates ) , apple , and cinnamon , due in large part , I suspect , to the fact that it actually contains those ingredients ! There are also raisins , cane and other sugars -- including fructose from fruit juices -- giving it a sweet but not cloying ( as they say at the wineries ) taste . This company is known for its quality ingredients and generally consumer-friendly face ; you can read more about them at powerbar.com . The company recommends consuming this with water to aid the absorption of the many added nutrients -- this also gives one a more `` full '' feeling .

This was actually a really good bar . I enjoyed the flavor and it managed to fill me up in place of a regular breakfast . I did n't get hungry until at least three hours later ( and for me that is actually pretty good , I 'm always hungry ) .The main flavor of this bar was the peanut butter . The chocolate barely made an appearance and that was just fine for me . It was just a surprise here and there when you hit a chip . The bar was chewy , but not really crunchy from the oats and other grains and fibers that were included in the bar . It was sweet , and that 's to be expected from the sweeteners of brown rice syrup , honey , evaporated can juice syrup and the chocolate chips . Lots of sweeteners in here making the bar content of sugar 18 grams . So that is something to watch.The rest of the ingredients were good . There 's whole oats , rice flour , and other pronounceable ingredients throughout . And a whole list of minerals and vitamins is included so it 's even somewhat nutritional for you . But there are a lot of allergens here as well , as is obvious by the peanut butter flavor . And another thing of note is that this bar packs a walloping 240 calories . So use it as a meal replacement or for during vigorous exercise as opposed to a snack . It would definitely be a good bar for a hiking trip.I liked it and will probably consider it again for breakfast . It kept me full and I liked the taste , and it will have inspired me to try other PowerBar flavors as well.Review by M. Reynard 2012	1
If you are a fan of peanut butter and chocolate , than this bar is for you . I 've tried a number of energy bars and they all suffer from one problem -- bland taste and usually end up leaving a gritty aftertaste in my mouth . Not so with PowerBar.I make a PowerBar part of my regular morning routine . After trying a few of the other flavors I finally stumbled upon the peanut butter and chocolate chip and was `` hooked '' . The flavor is just right and the crispness of the bar is not too hard , but firm enough to make you `` feel '' like you are eating a full meal . One bar will usually kill any cravings I have all throughout the morning .	1
Love these things before a work out , they provide some good energy to push me through . The crisp powerbars are my favorite , they really do n't have that chalky kind of after taste to them like some other energy bars .	1
There 's a vague taste of apple cinnamon , but mostly I taste oats . I do love that these fill me up and keep me full for awhile . They are exactly what I needed .	1
Traditional Medicinals ' `` Breathe Easy '' is an amazing tea . A couple of times I 've had asthma attacks , it 's clearing powers have worked ! It 's a delicious , spicy mix of Egyptian licorice , peppermint , ginger , and eucalyptus . It 's the drinkable Vaposteam & its benefits are incredible . Traditional Medicinals is based in beautiful Sebastopol , California , and its healing herbs come from their garden !	1
If my wife drinks a cup of this tea when she feels an attack coming on it often helps her avoid the attack at all . If we are out and she has an attack drinking this tea has lessened the effects and helped her recover more quickly.We have tried other tinctures and teas but his blend from TM has been wonderful ! It tastes great ( I enjoy it myself ) and it is an effective breathing aid . **of course this is not medical advice , this N1 experience .	1
I do n't know about the medicinal aspects of this tea , but the flavor is downright scrumptious . I love licorice root but have high blood pressure , so I 'm not guzzling down box after box each week . A few cups a week does n't touch my BP , so I keep it to that . The directions say to steep it for 10-15 minutes , but I 'm far too impatient for that . 4-6 minutes is all I can wait after smelling that lovely aroma . Traditional Medicinals puts out some really good teas . I just wish they were n't so proud of 'em . ChaChing ! Thanks , TM . Now try to work on that pricing for us , will ya ? Danke .	1
I had TB when I lived in Mexico in l970/71/72 . I used eucalyptus/licorice tea and actually cured myself . Since that time , I have used this tea every day as I love the taste of it . I recommend it to anyone who wants to strengthen their lungs .	1
Traditional Medicinals is the best tasting herbal tea out there that I have tried . I have tried the Yogi teas before and did not care for them . I bought the Traditionals Breathe Easy and the Gypsy Cold Care . I take the breathe easy whenever I feel congested or like now when I had a coughing attack from some scent . My throat felt irritated and my chest felt achey and wheezy . Brewed a cup of this tea with some honey and it was so delicious and soothing . I do n't know if its the way it makes you feel when you drink it because it tastes so good , or if the herbs really do help but I do feel better , a sense of calm . I highly recommend the Breathe Easy and the Gypsy Cold Care .	1
I really enjoy PowerBar ProteinPlus bars - but rarely buy them except when they are on sale . Purchasing them through Amazon is like having a sale everyday . I used the subscription for these PowerBars and reduced the cost even more . I have also purchased 2 other flavors . The Toffee Nut arrived the quickest . I have many food sensitivities , and these products do not trigger them . I feel vey happy to have them .	1
Everyone needs an extra boost of energy after exercise , and this good tasting bar provides just that.All the necessary nutrients are there to give you the lift you need.It is helpful to drink a tall glass of water along with it .	1
I have added one of these to my morning routine . I used to just drink a quart of water for breakfast , ( over about an hour and a half ) . I started eating one of these along with the water and I feel more energetic while getting ready for work . I buy three boxes ervery two months using the subscription method . Amazon sends a heads up email to you before shipping the subscribed items alowing you to add to or stop any shipments at your leisure .	1
I love having one of these in my backpack or purse as a back-up pick-me up that is n't overloaded with sugar , sodium or artificial sweeteners . I 'm deathly allergic to Splenda ( secretly added to many things today under the chemical name of sucralose ) , so I always check labels . Most energy bars are not high enough in protein , or are either overly sweet , overly salty or worse - overly bland . I do n't have the sensation that I 'm eating cardboard covered in flavoring . Unlike a lot of protein bars out there , I really have a sensation of being full after having one , instead of trying to find something else to snack on . I 'm one of those rare birds that hates chocolate , so it 's hard enough to find an option that is not dripping in the brown stuff . Rest assured , chocolate lovers , PowerBar does make chocolate flavored bars - but I very much appreciate having the vanilla yogurt bar as an option for protein . It is n't overly crunchy , so I do n't get flecks of particles all over my shirt when I grab one on the go - and I do n't get stuff stuck between my teeth eating these , either - so it 's safe to have before a staff meeting .	1
I am a runner and discovered this in a grocery store when I was at the four mile mark of a ten mile run and stopped for some water . This tastes great , and gives me plenty of energy when I run or work out in the gym . I also keep this at work for a snack .	1
This is awesome . It tastes like the fake marshmallows they put in immoral breakfast cereal , but instead of just tasting like sugar it tastes like fat as well . I ca n't believe I never tried this stuff until now , but I am definitely going to keep a stack of these in my desk.Disclosure:1 . Your block of `` ice cream '' WILL be broken into a bunch of smaller chunks . It is so brittle that they probably all end up like that ( this was the first one I ate , but one reason I passed on this stuff so many times is because I could tell by picking up the package that they were always broken ) .2 . Partly for the above reason , astronauts do n't actually eat this stuff any more . Wikipedia says it was used on one mission and was found to be inconvenient . Also , they have a freezer on the space station and just eat real ice cream.In spite of those facts , this stuff is delicious .	1
I bought these for a lightweight backpacking snack . From what I remembered as a kid they are very tasty , and I was not disappointed ! I 've read other reviews complain about they come broken apart - but that 's normal/acceptable - it in no way effects the quality of this product . The packaging of this is bulky - almost 0.4oz per ! Luckily this product stays fresh in just a ziplock bag for at least a week . I put most of these in a gallon ziplock and saved several ounces in weight over ditching the stock packaging material . Gave some to my son and he loved them as well - they make a great/unique gift to kids .	1
i have been eating this stuff since i was a kid and i am in love with it . it is soooo good and pretty cheap when you buy it on amazon .	1
I was born in the 80 's , and this was brought into class a few times . This is very good stuff , and is exactly how I remember it . It is however expensive . I ate the 10 pack within a day or two . I bought this to try out for long term food storage . They will last only a few years , which is expected because it 's a dairy product.Definitely a comfort food , I will be stocking up more . LOVE IT	1
This is one of my favorite desserts , and melts quickly in the mouth . This brand is good and it shipped well-packaged . Everyone should try this once . The amazon price is much better than the ones you find at science fairs .	1
my niece teaches underprivileged kids in florida -- - she had a science lesson and i sent her 3 boxes of this stuff -- - most of the kids would never in their lives have had a chance to taste this stuff -- - so for the price it was a good deal to share something that these kids would never have had ...	1
It 's cracked to pieces on purpose so it 's easier to eat . It 's a bit sweeter than regular ice cream because there 's no water . Convenient to take with you anywhere ! This brand contains NO High Fructose Corn Syrup so it 's healthier . Great deal ! $ 19.95 ordered on 8/3/2011 .	1
I 'm not sure why everyone says they are using this thing with their Brew n Go 's ... it 's tiny ! I 'm not sure what it is supposed to fit - but it 's itty bitty ! It does keep my 3 scoops of coffee in place , so I 'm going to use them - but keep in mind this is WAY smaller than you think it 's going to be ! When they are gone , 480 cups of coffee from now - I 'll be going back to my # 2 filters .	1
These fit the Brew N ' Go well , but could stand to be a little bit taller . I like to use a lot of fairly coarsely ground coffee to make a cup , which means that my minimum volume of grounds is the maximum this filter can carry . Another half inch or even an inch would make a huge difference - there 's certainly space in the coffee maker for it ! If you 're a normal coffee drinker , though , using fewer , finer grounds , this is an excellent choice for you .	1
I 've been using `` Melitta Cone Coffee Filters , Natural Brown , No . 1 '' for years with myBlack & Decker DCM18S Brew 'n Go Personal Coffeemaker with Travel Mug , but I can no longer find them at any of my local stores . Luckily I found them by the case at Amazon for much less than what I was paying for them at the store . I now have enough filters to last me at least 2 years . These filters fit my 1 cup Black and Decker coffee maker perfectly , and do a much better job filtering the coffee than the permanent filter that comes with it . Another supposed benefit is that paper coffee filters trap oily substances in coffee called `` diterpenes '' , which are said to raise your cholesterol levels , and are not filtered out if you use the permanent mesh filter . I highly recommend using the `` Melitta Cone Coffee Filters , Natural Brown , No . 1 '' .	1
This filter fits right into my one cup Black and Decker . Even though my coffee maker came with a `` permanant '' filter this ensures that there are no grounds in each perfect cup of coffee . I will purchase again .	1
No . 1 One Cup Coffee Filters : Received 40 filters to the case , 12 to a box . The filters fit perfectly into the Black and Decker one cup coffee maker sold by Amazon . No problems with loose coffee grinds spilling over into the coffee maker . Makes for quick and easy clean-up . Just wait until cool enough to remove and drop into the trash .	1
These filters fit nicely inside my individual-sized ceramic beverage strainer . Placed atop a coffee mug or teacup , the filter enables me to make coffee , or tea , minus coffee grounds or tea leaves in the end product ! Simply place the ground coffee or loose tea inside the filter , and pour in boiling water to fill the mug/cup . Alternatively , if are serving a group , coffee can be prepared in a percolator & loose tea in a teapot ... then , poured through filters into individual cups to remove any grounds/tealeaves . I became unable to locate the smaller sizes of these filters ( such as this # 1 ) in local retail stores years ago -- and was thrilled to discover that Amazon could supply them .	1
When the local grocers stopped carrying these , I was relieved that Melitta still shows them available on their website & # 8211 ; and very happy that Amazon sells them in bulk ( 12 boxes of 40 each ) . I still keep an eye out when I pass the coffee aisle in grocery stores , and no one stocks them anymore . Not sure why , as they seem to be a hit with folks who use single-serve coffee makers .	1
I like anything Melitta . Even the name & # 34 ; Melitta & # 34 ; is pretty , though I will hold off naming my first-born & # 34 ; Melitta , & # 34 ; as tempting as it might be . Bought these for my vintage Melitta coffeemaker , so - of course - they 're a perfect fit . Bought in bulk , they 're at a good price .	1
Nice and soft , super licorice flavor . I love licorice and have since I was a kid . This Panda product is very good licorice .	1
These soft licorice bites from Panda are not as soft as the & # 34 ; soft-eating licorice & # 34 ; from Down Under but are what I would describe as soft but chewy . They are truly & # 34 ; all natural & # 34 ; and have a minimum of ingredients & # 8211 ; & # 8211 ; molasses , wheat flour , licorice extract , and natural flavor ( aniseed oil ) . Nothing more than that . They have a slightly grainy texture , which comes from the use of wheat flour . They also have a strong , traditional licorice taste , which make them ideal for a person with a craving for genuine licorice .	1
I will come clean to you , here and now , and admit that I do have ONE addiction . That addiction is this totally wonderful Panda licorice . For starters , it is n't too sweet . Secondly , it is made with anise oil and has a wonderful flavor . Plus , the blurb on the side of the box is right . Licorice does have mellowing properties and helps with digestion , and I also notice that I feel less stressed after I eat it . [ Or is this purely psychological ? ] It 's wonderful for those days when you are craving a treat , but do n't want to feel guilty afterwards . It 's fat free and you should definitely keep it in on a high shelf out of reach , or you might find yourself eating the box in just a couple of days !	1
I have tried other brands and this one is by far the best Licorice on the market today . Buy it !	1
I often buy this licorice at the health food store and it 's expensive , but with the add on item program , I can tuck it into other purchases and get a great price . So if you want the real thing a a great price , tuck it into the cart and get a bargain .	1
Panda licorice , There is not too much I can say about panda licorice It 's very good that 's why I keep on buying it .	1
I see my review is pretty much in agreement with another review here . But I 'll put it here anyway.I ordered this along with Pero Extra and Roastaroma to try the three . I 'm a former Postum aficionado and had certainly developed quite a liking to Postum.Really ca n't take Pero Extra very much . I keep trying it again and again , prolly 10 times now , to see if I can develop a liking for it and just ca n't . I 'm sure some people may like it , but it 's just not for me.Cafix is what I 'll usually go for , but it has a certain sort of built in sweetness ( very mild , barely distinguishable ) which comes from the beets that are added . Over time I 've found it just sort of fills in some of the void from lack of Postum , and while it 's not a Postum replica it has certain Postum like qualities.The Roastaroma actually is what I think tastes the best of the three , but it 's taste is just not at all like Postum , is however very balanced and has a nice maltiness to it . Often I 'll put just a little bit of Stevia powder in it . ( I could always tell if I 've ingested aspartame by ( or nutrasweet , whatever ) by how I felt , and try to verify any food/drink I ingest does n't have aspartame . I mean , an item which arose out of research into nerve agents for warfare , and itself found to be an effective weapon , really should n't be passed off as a food item . Stevia is ground plant matter , even less processed that sugar . ) The combo makes a really nice morning or late evening drink .	1
This is a great tasting product . I use this sometimes instead of the Pero . This helped me to quit coffee .	1
I like mine with a little milk and sweetener . It 's much easier on the stomach than coffee is , and it has a pleasant taste . I use it as an alternative to teas on occasion .	1
I bought a case of all three products , Inka , Pero and Cafix in order to compare them . Honestly ? They are all the same , so go with whatever is the cheapest . I think I did like Cafix the best , but it may be a mental thing with the name at least sounding somewhat like Coffee . There is little difference in all three , they look identical with only tiny coloration differences . All by themselves they do not taste like coffee and if you are a black coffee drinker ? Pass , because you will not be satisfied with the taste . It is very bland all by itself . BUT , if you like cream in your coffee ? You wo n't even notice the difference between coffee and these products within a week or two you will forget you are not drinking coffee . I am PERFECTLY happy with all three products and will continue to drink them ; I will choose by PRICE due to the very similar make of them all . The cans all read the same ingredient wise .	1
i use this on every pizza i have ! sweet and spicy and goes good with the sweetness of the pizza sauce.i use the green version on white sauce pizza 's : - )	1
Just a little is needed to get the full effect . This seasoning blend is spicy hot , just like the label states . It still tastes good , like the more mild version , but it has a definite kick to it . What I like to do is mix the two , this one and Chef Paul Prudhomme 's Magic Seasoning Blends ~ Pizza & Pasta Magic Herbal . That way it is not too intense for me .	1
I 've commented on other spices from Chef Paul Prudhomme in the past . His all have great quality and spice mixture .	1
This is a great product to accent your pizza and pasta sauces without adding the things you do n't want into your diet ! It is a little bit hot as a seasoning and you can also sprinkle it onto spaghetti or pizza . It is also very good when sprinkled onto casseroles or soups . I like it as it has no calories , no total fat , no sodium , no carbohydrates and no additional protein . It also contains no MSG or any preservatives.It lets you add the zest you like without adding items like salt or calories . This is a good product and we like it as a seasoning for many of our Italian dishes . I recommend it to you as a good product .	1
This is such a fantastic product - I use it all the time and will continue to order it . Thank you , Paul Prudhomme !	1
This was good stuff but I just went thru it too fast . So I bought my last really large bottle at BJ 's wholesale and it tastes the same and does the job .	1
Very good vanilla extract and organic too ! This comes in a close second to my homemade organic vanilla extract . Will keep a bottle in my cabinet , while waiting for mine to & # 34 ; develop & # 34 ; .	1
This bottle is a steal , at Whole Foods ( at least where I live ) a bottle half this size costs twice as much . Before I was also using imitation vanilla , it smells okay but you can smell the fillers . This bottle smells like fresh , pure vanilla . I used it in a lemon poppy seed cake and it was delicious , mild and aromatic ! My kitchen smelled WONDERFUL !	1
Very good and even better knowing it is organic . Like I said I will continue buying this product.i do a lot of cooking .	1
Jamaica Blue Mountain Coffee is my absolute favorite coffee . It has a nice rich taste and a super smooth texture . I have yet to find a coffee that I like near as much . That being said , I bought my Blue Mountain Coffee in Jamaica ... not online ... so I ca n't vouch for the quality/freshness here .	1
So many coffee enthusiasts come back to Blue Mountain time and time again as one of the finest coffees you can find in the world . This is so delicious it wo n't last long .	1
Probably at least three decades ago , I purchased a Melitta Cone Filter Manual Coffeemaker ( 6 cup ) . I was just getting started on grinding my own coffee and I read somewhere that this was the way to make the best coffee . I was very satisfied and it lasted for years and years . Then I met my wife . She took one look at my coffee-making operation and shook her head in disbelief . I needed a high-end coffeemaker . This just would n't do ! Well , I ended up buying a Cuisineart Coffeemaker with all kinds of bells and whistles . It was good equipment and made a good cup of coffee , although the cost of the equipment was over 7 times that of my Melitta and the coffee was n't as good . Plus , the equipment had to be meticulously cleaned and that quickly turned into an onerous task . My old Melitta was relegated to camping duties and finally lost.Well , my wife is now gone . And I was about to clean the Cuisineart Coffeemaker for the umpteenth time . I came up with the brilliant idea of going back to a Melitta . Good move ! They were still around . I could n't spot them in stores , but they were available on Amazon . What a neat gadget ! I used it this morning and the coffee tasted so good ! And it was so simple ! And it took no longer than my super-duper coffeemaker . What a relief to be back to a simpler life . Well , I cleaned my Cuisineart Coffeemaker and stored it away . If I have guests , I can always break it out just to show them how I 'm living the good life . Now , remember all that nasty business about cleaning that Cuisineart ? Well , with the Melitta , you can just put the component parts into the upper rack of the dishwasher . The Melitta is clearly a superior coffee maker.Gary Peterson	1
really , it works just like a drip coffee maker but with the hassle that comes with cleaning them . I use and electric kettle to heat my water and it works well	1
I have been intrigued by the pour over coffee makers . We have a Bunn automatic that uses pour over and it produces a good cup of coffee , but I DH likes his coffee strong and thus the coffee is usually a bit bitter for my taste . I usually stick to tea . Everything I have read says the manual pour over produces a strong but smoother coffee.I priced out various pour over cones and carafes , but the priced seemed high when we did n't even know if we would like it . I saw this Melitta at a great add on price ( $ 9 @ my purchase ) . It seemed perfect for a starter set . The cost was less than some of the other brands paper filters . The set includes the cone filter , the carafe , a lid and 5 paper filters- everything you need to try it out . I considered getting the larger one , but another reviewer noted that the coffee does not stay warm long and figured we would be better off with a size we could drink quickly . While I was looking for a non-plastic cone , this is BPA free . The carafe is made in Germany , the cone top is made in Canada.Now to the coffee ... It is fantastic ! I use the espresso grind that DH uses in the Bunn . The coffee is just as strong without the bitterness . It does n't seem to take any more time . I use the Hario kettle on our induction stove so boiling water takes no time . Then , the pour over is almost zen like . I mainly use this on my late mornings and on weekends . We may eventually upgrade to ceramic cone , but this suits our needs at present .	1
EASY OF USEI 've used the Mellita Coffee System for about 40 years . I find the system more convenient than coffee machines. > If the power goes off , you can still make coffee if you have a gas stove or a camp stove. > It is easy to brew exactly the amount of coffee you want , and exactly the strength that you want -- -including adjusting to new roast and grinds . You can even mix caffeinated and decaffeinated coffees if you wish. > In a way , the Mellita system is more `` sanitary '' . It is easy to forget a used filter in a coffee maker , maybe for weeks if you go on a vacation , and find a fungus garden in there . You ca n't ignore a used Melitta filter , because it is out in the open . If you forget a used Melitta filter , it and the coffee grinds just dry out . It is also much easier to wash the Melitta components -- -just a quick rinse under the tap is usually good enough . Caveat -- some types of coffee are oiler than others -- -you may need to actually wash your cone and carafe if a quick rinse is not sufficient.SIZE OPTIONSThe carafes for which the `` 6 cup '' and `` 10 cup '' systems can nominally hold 6 or 10 cups off coffee ( filled to the brim ) , but that is really irrelevant . A more important consideration is cups vs mugs . How many people still drink `` cups '' of coffee ? So , it is the `` mug-capacity '' ( 1 mug = 1 1/2 cups ) of the filters and cones which really counts. # 2 filters/conesRecomemnded : 1 cupPractical Maximum : 1 mugTheoretical Maximum : 2 cups # 4 filters/cones ( `` 6 cup system '' ) Recommended : 1-2 mugsPractical Maximum : 2 1/2 mugsTheoretical Maximum : 4 mugs # 6 filters/cones ( `` 10 cup system '' ) Recommended : 2-3 mugsPractical Maximum : 4 mugsTheoretical Maximum : 6 mugsHowever , I do n't follow my own recommendation : In the morning , I want coffee `` now ! '' I often run out of patience trying to brew even 1 mug of coffee using # 4 filter/cones . On the other hand , the # 6 filter/cones holds a whole mug of hot water in one quick pour , and drains about as fast as you can continue to pour the water in -- -so I find it very convenient for brewing 1 to 2 mugs of coffee at a time , and on rare occasions to easily brew 4 mugs ( 6 cups ) of coffee . However , in this case , the hot water has little time to extract the flavor from the coffee . To compensate , I grind my coffee very finely . I could simply use more coffee , but that would be wasteful.The # 6 filters/cones ( `` 10-cup system '' ) is faster and more flexible , at a slightly higher cost for the filters.Melitta Cone Filter Coffeemaker 10 Cup , 1-CountIf you are patient and your space is very limited , such as in a camper , boat , or in a college dorm , or if you really want only 1 or 2 mugs of coffee at a time , # 4 filter/cones ( the so-called `` 6 cup system '' ) is a good choice.GRINDS OF COFFEEIf you usually brew the `` recommended '' or fewer number of mugs of coffee , then very-finely ground coffee is recommended . If you usually brew the the `` recommended '' or more number of mugs at a time , then a medium grind coffee may work best . Most supermarket `` fine grind '' is actually a medium grind . If you brew more than the `` practical maximum '' a medium-coarse grind will work better . If you grind your own coffee in an electric grinder , `` coarse '' is only a second or two , medium-fine is perhaps 10 seconds , and very fine is perhaps 30 seconds , until the pitch of the sound changes , indicating that no more grinding is taking place.REUSEIf you use very-fine grind , then discard the used filter when finished ( because most of the flavor will be extracted , and the filter will be clogged up by the fine grinds ) . If you use a medium grind , then you can optionally reuse the grinds in the afternoon to make a second batch of coffee ( which will be lower in caffeine ) . Coffee-freaks may object to reusing grinds , but it works just fine.FORMULARegardless of the grind , you have to use the same formula for the TOTAL amount of coffee actually made , i.e. , 1 to 2 tablespoons of ground coffee per mug , depending on your taste , brand , etc.FILTERSPresumably , brown filters are easier on the environment -- -and on you , less chemicals having been used to manufacture them . Unfortunately , # 6 filters are hard to find in most grocery stores , but easy to purchase via Amazon.Melitta Cone Coffee Filters , Natural Brown , No . 6 , 40-Count Filters ( Pack of 12 ) Melitta Cone Coffee Filters , Natural Brown , No . 2 , 100-Count Filters ( Pack of 6 ) Melitta Cone Coffee Filters , White , No . 6 , 40-Count Filters ( Pack of 12 ) In an emergency , you can use # 4 filters in a # 6 cone , but you 'll regret it ( having been spoiled by the convenience of # 6 filters ) .RECOMMENDATIONS ON MAKING GOOD COFFEE > > Use fresh unchlorinated water if possible . Do not use `` softened '' , `` sparkling '' , or `` mineral '' water . If you let an open pitcher of water sit on a counter for a few hours ( or overnight ) , most of the chlorine will evaporate . The best way to get pure water is a reverse-osmosis system . Bring the water to a quick boil , but do n't leave it boiling too long -- that will flush out the dissolved oxygen , leaving the coffee tasting flat. > > There is a huge difference between brands and roasts . Experiment and enjoy . However , even more important is freshness -- -which is the greatest challenge . How can you know if the coffee is fresh ? The easiest way is to signup with a service such as Gavelia , Boca Java , or Coffee Bean Direct -- whose only business is providing you with freshly roasted ( and freshly-ground if you wish ) coffee. > > Particularly if you do not use a `` coffee service '' , its best to buy whole beans and grind them just before brewing . A $ 15 grinderKrups 203-42 Fast Touch Coffee Grinder , Blackis as good as a $ 200 grinder . It takes only a few seconds to grind a batch of coffee while waiting for the water to boil. > > For newbies , `` French '' or `` dark roast '' coffee is rich and bitter , and usually brewed `` strong '' . Light roasts are more complex , but some are acidic , and are usually brewed and drank more like tea . Light roast Indonesian coffee is particularly complex . Caveat , `` complex '' does not necessarily mean flavorful -- -some dark roasts are wonderful , but it is probably harder to find a good dark roast . TheCoffee Bean Direct Assorted Whole Bean Coffee Sampler , 9-Pound Boxavailable from Amazon is a good way to explore the varieties of coffee. > > The filter cone and carafe should be rinsed off after every use , otherwise your coffee can be contaminated with stale oils . A weekly wash in the dishwasher wo n't hurt. > > Elsewhere , you 'll read endless nonsense about the exact water temperature , how fast or how slow to pour the water , the value of porcelain vs plastic cones , preheating the cones with hot water , how finely ground the coffee should be , etc . It 's all nonsense ( except possibly to engineers who design coffeemakers ) . 99 % of what matters is the quality of the ingredients : water and coffee . You want fresh oxygenated chlorine-free salt-free water , and good quality recently-roasted and recently-ground coffee.SAFETYIt is easy to forget the glass carafe on a hot stove . I broke at least 6 carafes before I purchased a whistling teakettle.Revere 2-1/3-Quart Whistling Tea KettleNEVER use the carafe to boil water or reheat coffee . The flood of water might crack a ceramic stovetop , or put out a the flame of a gas stove -- -both causing catastrophic problems . Use your microwave to reheat ( 1 mug of coffee = 30-45 seconds ) ; it 's faster and safer.It is important to take care to pour the boiling water into the filter , not between the filter and the filter cone . It is any easy accident to make . To minimize such accidents , fold over the `` joined '' edges of the filters so that the filter opens wider . If you are a particular klutz , a quick rinse with a little cold water before you add the ground coffee can `` glue '' the filter to the cone.SUGAR IN YOUR COFFEE ? Purist insist that coffee should always be drank black . While I tentatively agree , I ca n't . My taste-buds are overly sensitive to bitterness . However , I have found that pure SteviaPure Stevia Extract Powder by Kal - 3.5 ozis a good replacement for sugar for me . Oddly , it is n't as sweet as sugar , but is just as effective in cutting the bitterness , which is what I really need . Truvia and other brands in packets or described as `` spoonable '' contain bulking agents which effect the flavor and leave a yucky residue , and are comparatively expensive . KAL Pure Stevia contains no bulking agents and is very economical.SALT IN YOUR COFFEE ? It 's a naval tradition . I 've found that a few grains of sea-salt in a cup of light-roast coffee can be pleasant , but not so compelling that I make a habit of it . However , a little salt is more noticeable ( in a good way ) in ice coffee.MILK IN YOUR COFFEE ? If the purpose is just to cut the acidity , then you need to try a different coffee or brewing method . If the purpose is to cut the bitterness , you might want to try stevia instead . If you simply like milk in your coffee -- -I say , indulge yourself with a little real ( not fake ) half-and-half , or even heavy cream . I usually drink my coffee black with a little stevia , but for a rare desert cup , real sugar and real cream are essential.GENERAL SHOPPING RECOMMENDATIONAfter major grocery shopping expeditions , sit down at your computer with your receipt , and check if you can buy any of the non-perishables through Amazon . When you find items ( even if more expensive than you just paid ) , put the item on your Amazon wish list , and add a note to the wish list of the price you just paid . Check your wish list frequently , and when you see an item you need at a bargain price , buy it .	1
I used to have a larger Melitta manual coffeemaker . When the carafe broke ( can any glass carafe survive a close encounter with a tile floor ? ) , I did n't replace it because I no longer needed such a large coffeemaker . I thrashed around trying to find a smaller coffeemaker that made coffee as well as my reliable old Melitta with no success . I was delighted to find this smaller Melitta model here at Amazon . I am once again enjoying delicious coffee using my preferred type of coffeemaker .	1
This works just like it look in the picture , simple easy way to make good coffee if your using good coffee and the right amount of coffee and quality water . Only complaint is the bottom hole were the coffee comes out of the funnel looks like it was broken off its mold crudely rather than cleanly cut like on my single Melitta pour over .	1
This is a basic drip funnel and carafe that uses a # 4 filter.I 've been a fan of steam espresso machines for twenty years , every day , every day for twenty years . The problem , the espresso machines would scale up and either need cleaning ( descaling ) or blow the safety valve in the lid and be rendered useless . We have gone through countless steam espresso machines over the years and spent many a Saturday ( yes , the whole day ) soaking the espresso machine in descaling solution and then cleaning the descaling solution out of the espresso machine so the first cup in the morning , would n't taste like descaling solution.Well , we can no longer find ... ..anywhere , basic steam espresso machines as all we can find are fancy espresso machines that will quickly clog up with scale or drip coffee makers that churn out weak , watery coffee shop style coffee ... .. '' More coffee hun ? '' Do you really want to know ? Enters this drip carafe as I tried making drip coffee out of a paper towel and a strainer and found the coffee to be acceptable but still a bit bitter and not up to par . I ordered up this carafe with six hundred # 4 filters at less than one-third the cost of what a replacement steam espresso coffee maker would have cost , based upon the last purchase price of eighty dollars US.Yes , it 's a bit of a `` BIG '' pain to make a carafe of coffee . The water needs to be heated in a microwave , two cups at a time for four minutes and then slowly drizzled over the fresh grinds until all the water has been allowed to drain through the filter . This needs to be done twice , using three heaping teaspoons of fresh ground , French Roast , coffee beans , in each of two filter baskets.The good , now that 's what I 'm talking about ! The resulting coffee is fresh , thick , robust , smooth , full flavor , that 's what I 'm talking about , coffee . The point , if you care about your coffee and how it tastes , for the effort , this is for you . We drink our coffee black and do not find need to add creams , sugars or otherwise to make it palpable as we like our coffee in the morning , just as it is , perfectly black.An aside , we buy filters , six hundred filters at a time . We use three to four filters each morning as we brew up coffee at the rate of sixteen ounces per three heaping teaspoons of fresh ground coffee , per filter . Doing the math , this is about a six month supply of coffee filters.If you 're looking for convenience , dash and go , this is not for you . If you 're looking to have fresh , smooth , robust coffee in the morning and do n't mind the hassle it takes to get what you want , this package is definitely for you. -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -Addendum : I like this combination so much that today , 10Aug13 , I purchased a second pot/filter cone combination . FYI , the coffee is the best morning coffee we 've had . We are very happy with the coffee this hand pour drip system makes . It 's a bit slow working with a single filter cone so in a few days , we 'll have a second pot/filter cone to speed the morning coffee making process up . Yes , more cleaning after making coffee but definitely worth the extra effort .	1
No more looking in stores to see piles of # 2 and # 4 filters , but no # 6s . So much easier to use than the smaller ones . And of course the price is right in bulk and no gas used looking for them . I like the Melitta system , coffee competitive with more complex methods at a lower price .	1
I love these filters ! They work great in large applications and I cut them to fit my 4 cup maker as well and have had no issues ! Would buy again .	1
For the Melitta Cone Filter Coffeemaker . I bought a whole box of them and thought it would take forever to use them up , but it did n't . I have been getting them at a local grocers for a while , and I think it 's about time to order another box .	1
These are the best paper coffee filters I 've found . Just make sure to fold over the crimped edges so that the filter does n't come apart during brewing . I use the `` pour over '' method of brewing coffee with a filter cone because most coffee makers do not get the water hot enough for a proper brew . I brew directly in to a stainless carafe.Unlike other reviewers , I received all 12 boxes of filters.I use this filter cone & brew directly in to my stainless carafe : Copco 2 Quart Thermal Capacity Brushed Stainless Steel CarafeRSVP Maunual Drip Coffee Filter Cone for Carafes or ThermosI use this water kettle to heat the water : Oster 5965 Stainless-Steel 1-1/2-Liter Electric Water Kettle	1
Like everyone else , I have discovered that it is no longer possible to find the number 6 filters in local stores . I do not understand this . I live forty miles from New York City , hardly a wilderness area . However , I was happy to find the filters on Amazon . By combining the filters with another order , I was able to get free shipping.Is brown better than white ? Many people believe that since the brown filters require less processing than the white filters , i.e. , white filters are bleached , the brown filters are better environmentally . I will go with that . My experience has been that the brown filters tend to break through more often than the white ones . These seem to be ok , but I do give them an extra fold where they are joined on the side and the bottom .	1
I 've used the Mellita Coffee System for about 40 years . I find the system more convenient than coffee machines.If the power goes off , you can still make coffee if you have a gas stove or a camp stove.It is easy to brew exactly the amount of coffee you want , and exactly the strength that you want -- -including adjusting to new roast and grinds . You can even mix caffeinated and decaffeinated coffees if you wish . I often re-use the morning 's grinds in the afternoon , by adding a spoon of decaffeinated coffee . That is not recommended with an automatic coffee machine -- -because if you clog up the filter , the boiling water could overflow . No problem clogging up a Melitta filter , if it drains slowly , then pour slowly.In a way , the Mellita system is more `` sanitary '' . It is easy to forget a used filter in a coffee maker , maybe for weeks if you go on a vacation , and find a fungus garden in there . You ca n't ignore a used Melitta filter , because it is out in the open . If you forget a used Melitta filter , it and the coffee grinds just dry out.Although most people use smaller Mellita filters and cones , I prefer the large # 6 system . The # 6 system ( filters , cone , and caraf ) is intended for brewing 4-8 cups at a time . However , the larger filter holds more water , and it drains faster , so you can brew 2 cups of coffee with a # 6 filter faster than with a # 4 filter . So the # 6 system is faster and more flexible , at a very slightly higher cost for the filters.If you grind your own coffee , the water ( for 1-2 cups ) is almost boiling by the time you 've set up the filter , ground the coffee , and put away the coffee grinder . A # 6 filter actually holds the water for about 2 cups of coffee , but drains so fast that pouring 4-8 cups of water through just takes perhaps 10 -- 15 seconds . The corresponding # 6 glass carafe is marked for up to 8 cups , but obviously it takes longer to boil the water for 8 or so cups of coffee.It 's as simple as it gets , the price of the filters is cheap , and the quality of the results as terrific . What else could you want ? Presumably , brown filters are easier on the environment -- -and on you , less chemicals having been used to manufacture them.The specific Amazon product is probably the cheapest way to purchase the preferred filters.NOTEIt is important to take care to pour the boiling water into the filter , not between the filter and the filter cone . It is any easy accident to make . To minimize such accidents , fold over the `` joined '' edges of the filters so that the filter opens wider .

I ordered these after I had ordered a single 40 count package to see how I liked them . They were really great and they work great with the cone and a 51 0z carafe . I am very satisfied with my purchase and delighted that they are offered through the subscribe and save program .	1
Yes , they are totally artificial . But for special events like birthdays , I honestly feel that its okay to use them , and nothing colors frosting like gel food coloring . I used to buy the single larger colors , but Id end up having them for years , and they do get funky tasting . Im so happy to have found this assortment . It has every color a person could need , including dark and light skin tones . And you can blend them to make even more shades if you desire.Each color comes in a smaller size than when you buy them individually , which is great for me because I only use them 4-5 times a year .	1
My daughter who lives in Seattle is a cupcake baker , and this product was a Christmas stocking gift for her !	1
Yeah , this dye is tasteless as advertised ! I know there are already a million 5 star reviews but I thought I would join the chorus anyways . The dyes here are really vibrant and most importantly tasteless . This allows you to make really beautiful fondant cakes . I literally put like 1 drop of this dye gel in about a 4 '' ball of fondant and it came out the shade I wanted . The colors are pretty much full spectrum of the rainbow plus black . You can mix and match if you want to get more colors . I found it very easy to use . There are instructions on the box . I paired this with purchased fondant and made a very lovely orange , red , and black Halloween themed cake . I ca n't wait to use these again . For the price of less than $ 11 , I feel like I got a good deal .	1
I fell in love with cake decorating as a child , watching my Dad decorate a cake for my school Valentine 's Day party . By the time I was thirteen I was decorating cakes myself . Paste food colors , which allow for very intense color without using a lot of product , have had a home in my kitchen for more than 50 years . Often they have been Wilton colors . In years past when I was doing lots of cake decorating I usually bought 1 ounce or even 4 ounce jars of color , but even a 1 ounce jar is far more than you need for the limited use of home baking.The half-ounce jars inWilton 601-5580 1/2-Ounce Certified-Kosher Icing Colors , Set of 12offer enough color to easily last a year or more , even allowing for dyeing your Easter eggs . Do remember that a tiny bit of this goes a very , very long way and that it will stain your hands & counter . I find it best to remove only a small part of the inner seal and then use a toothpick to remove just the tiniest bit of color at a time . ( You can always add more for deeper color . ) A couple of notes - Frosting colored with paste color deepens in color as it stands . You wo n't notice this much with pastel colors but it is readily apparent with bright red , blue and green . Roses the exact red of red roses when you make them will dry a very deep maroon . Also , very deep colors that require a substantial amount of color to achieve usually will have an `` off '' taste from so much color.How to Dye Eggs with Paste Color -This will give you true red , purple , bright blue and other brilliantly hued eggs.Put about 1/3-1/2 teaspoon of paste color in the bottom of a cup or mug . ( I like to use cups with light colored interiors . ) Add 1 teaspoon of white or cider vinegar , then fill the cup to about 1.5 inches from the top with boiling water . Stir to dissolve . Soak hard boiled eggs in the color solution until you get the shade you want . Remove to drain and dry on paper towels .	1
Love the colors , and find them easy to use . Do n't need Kosher , but these were the only ones available at the time and I needed them quick .	1
A bit pricey , but a little goes a long way . And the colors provided can be combined to make any color your little heart desires . Cool if you 're into cake decorating .	1
What a great variety of colors ! They work so much better than liquid coloring . I highly recommend buying this and always having fun colors to choose from .	1
I 've taken to making cupcakes and cookies and making icing letters on them ... you know , an `` H '' on one cookie , `` A '' on another , and so forth , and arrange the cookies or cupcakes to spell out HAPPY BIRTHDAY or whatever the occasion might be . I prefer bold , rich colors , like jewel tone colors , so these gel colors fit the bill to get the bold color without watering down my icing . Only takes a few toothpicks of color to get what I 'm looking for , so each 1/2 ounce color is going to go a long way . A good buy , all around . I will never go back to regular liquid food coloring ! Also , I know others have stated this but I 'll say it again , the black color is good but you have to start with a chocolate icing , not a white icing . **Update** I found another use for these Wilton colors by making colored sugar . I 've used it with granulated sugar and with sparkling sugar ( bigger crystals ) and it works great either way , but the sparkling sugar is more , well , `` sparkly '' which I like since I use the colored sugar to decorate cakes and cookies with . Put the sugar into a Ziploc bag , take the tip of a butter knife to get some color on it , then wipe the color off the knife on the inside of the bag . ( Does that make sense ? ) Zip up the bag , then mash the sugar around with the color until evenly distributed . The color will come off the side of the plastic bag just fine and blend in with the sugar . Then spread the sugar out on a plate or a sheet of foil to dry for a few hours . Voila !	1
I often cater for parties or events and every once in awhile I get someone who just has to have an off color . Trying to recreate these colors without buying a ton of different food colors is really hard , however this has such a strong color that you only need a little . I will admit that it takes some getting use to as you ca n't double dip and because the colors are so potent it can be a little hard to create certain colors . There is a colormap on the back that will help you to create all kinds of colors , so you do n't have to waste time trying to figure it out yourself . The only word of caution I would give as usual is that the purple and black dye are horrid ! If you are a baker , you already know this , but if you 're new to the baking game , you will thank me for that tip later .	1
I bought this based on several recommendations I had read on melt and pour soap sites . I 'll say this for it , when it comes to coloring my soaps I 've not been able to figure out WHAT color I will end up getting . I 've had soaps start purple and end up dark green . I know this is a function of the interaction with the various fragrance oils and essential oils I use , something I was n't really expecting to happen so frequently , particularly with purples , pinks , and blues . Some of the colors do stay true -- turquoise , green , yellows and orange . All this said , the item does say FOOD coloring , not SOAP coloring.I 've also used this in both cream cheese frosting and regular decorative frosting and the colors are amazingly vibrant with only a small amount of colorant . I can not taste any discernible difference in the frosting with the colorant . It will stain just about everything it touches -- my ceramic ( formerly ) white sink , hands , fingernails , and dish towels , to name a few . I would n't turn children loose with it without childproofing your kitchen first .	1
As an experienced baker for decades , I have used gel , paste , liquid , and powder artificial colorings . For the best control , I prefer the gels and powders . Whether doing royal , butter cream , color flow , fondant , or marzipan , the gel gives me an immediate , true color . I have been a Wilton customer for 30 years and will not use another brand.Tips : When opening each little jar , DO NOT fully remove the foil cover over the product . Insert a wooden tooth pick to open a small hole . Unless you are making a large quantity of icing , you wo n't need to widen it and remove more than what is on your toothpick each time you pull out some color on it.Store the jars with the lids secured and in an upright position.I found another use for these colors recently . I used wood putty to repair a decorative shelf made of fiberglass . Using two shades of Wilton colors , I was able to re-produce the colors I needed . Anything that needs color and is sealed with a protective coating and does not get much wear will probably be just fine .	1
Check the picture I 've submitted to see the kind of color that just a little of the dye give you . There 's a good mix of color choice here , everything from black to light flesh tone to violet . I 've only made one cake with it so far but I only needed a little for spectacular results . I 'll get a lot of use out of the amount provided , and when I 'm done I will be coming back to this brand for more . There is a huge difference between this and normal liquid food dye that most of us grew up with ! -- Updated April 2011 -- The same jars have been in use for ages now and still continue to impress me . Just last week I used them to color some home made play dough with fantastic results -- I expected that there would be an issue with the dye coming off on little hands during playtime , but we were careful to mix the dye in with the dough and have n't had any issues . I highly recommend this set whenever someone I know is looking to do something involving food dye .	1
nice set of gel colors . glad i made the purchase . i got tired of keep having to buy the liquid food colors . seemed like i wasted more money using them compared to these . glad i made the switch .	1
Prompt arrival of product . I used some mixed with water to make a liquid to marinate my strips of meat . The spice is mixed directly into hamburger meat as you make that kind of jerky . I had some left over after marinating so I stuck it in the freezer so as not to just waste what was left , and i think it will be fine to thaw and add to for my next batch . ( I liked the hand striped solid meat better than the hamburger meat jerky ) . Good stuff if you aren ` t into making your own spices for jerky like me .	1
My husband used this seasoning on his latest deer jerky , and the guys have eaten it up ... I wish I could tell you how it tastes , but there was nothing left for me !	1
I buy this at WalMart ... it 's by the food dehydrators/blenders/coffee makers . It 's a little cheaper there than I see it here ... but honestly if you calculate how much the meat and seasoning is , you are saving a lot of money . We love commercial jerky , but it 's too expensive . We use our Nesco dehydrator , jerky gun and ground beef . I just buy whatever beef is on sale , mix it with this seasoning and it 's amazing ! We 've only make ground beef jerky with this , but that 's all we eat anyway . Excellent product ... delicious jerky . I like to make batches as gifts for people ... trim the ends of the jerky strips so they look nice and put them in a glass cylinder , tied with a ribbon . People LOVE getting it and it 's an inexpensive gift . Buy it !	1
I ordered this and the Cracked Pepper and Garlic flavors , both worked out well but I liked the original more . I used this as exactly as I could to the volume of weight and it did seem a little extra salty - I know Jerky is supposed to be salty of course but if I had one and only one complaint it would be regarding that . Next time I 'll try limiting some of the salt and see how that goes , but either way I do recommend this product it 's very easy to use and tastes good . Oh , I used this both for ground beef ( using a jerky gun ) and for flank steak pieces.-D	1
almost nothing better than See 's . This chocolate is so yummy and the price is right for this product right here on Amazon . Especially if you are a Prime Amazon member and can find it right here . So easy . Then just sit back and wait for the mailman .	1
See 's Candies is a well-known California chocolate company , now with stores and distribution throughout the United States . In California , the lines to buy chocolate can snake out the door . I 've had See 's Candies many times , most recently this assortment , and while See 's makes an excellent product , the chocolate coating could be richer in flavor . Still , these confections are above average ; they easily outclass ordinary brands such as Russell Stover and Whitman 's with fresher and more flavorful fillings.Anyone receiving a box of See 's Candies for a gift knows that an extra effort has been made . Although they are n't the best I 've had , they certainly rank up there with the finest chocolate assortments available in a box .	1
What can I say - it 's See 's candy and they have n't changed in all these years - except for the PRICE ! This is a LOT of money to pay for a box of chocolates ! So - you had better love the person you are buying it for ( including yourself ) to want to spend that much on a single layer box . They 're good - but once a year is enough unless it 's someone VERY special !	1
See 's is the best ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! This was a gift for my daughter and her friend , who live in Florida . No see 's store there , so they really appreciate it ! ! ! ! ! !	1
To our taste these chocolates are on a par with far more expensive ones in glittery gift boxes.We often take them as hostess gifts ( hoping , of course , that said hostess will immediately open them and pass them around . ) See 's Candies has n't disappointed us yet .	1
Ordered these for a gift . Not all the See 's chocolates had an option for gift wrapping but these did so that 's what we went with . While I ca n't comment on the freshness of the product since we 'll never see them they shipping was super quick . Very glad it made it there sooner rather than later . Was supposed to arrive on the 17th via PRIME but actually arrived on the 14th ... how this is possible I 'm not sure . Did they wrap it up and hand deliver it ? lol	1
I love this stuff ! It is great in dipping sauces . I also like this in my chicken soup broth or pretty much any soup . I would n't think of eating Ramen noodles normally but with some of this stuff , I will eat it and like it . I think it is better than Schriacha sauce , you just have to be careful and use a small amount till you know how strong it is and then you will be adding it to everything . I do a quick dipping sauce with soy sauce , vinegar , sugar and this oil . Great for dumplings ! This is a staple that everyone should have in kitchen .	1
I got this specifically to make dan dan noodles , and it was perfect ! the chunky bits of chili are so good I use this when I make chinese stir frys too . its really spicy but not omg my mouth..its a smoother spicy if that makes any sense lol	1
My favorite nearby Asian food mart is closing with plans to reopen months from now in a new location . I need this stuff badly as a staple that must always be in stock , but I do n't need it badly enough to pay nearly twice what it costs in a retail store , plus nearly double that again to have it sent to me . I love Amazon so I hate it when Amazon is the worst possible place to buy a product , but there it is.I will look around for other sources because this stuff is AWESOME . It has more fire than the relatively wimpy chili oils in the ethnic sections of mainstream US grocery stores , but you can control the burn factor by choosing how much to use in your recipe or as a condiment . The flavor is subtle and is n't overbearing even if you load it on to increase the heat . Very versatile and very good .	1
Although many folks cook with this oil I use it as a condiment . I love the way the spicy heat builds and spreads , and the subtle and not-so-subtle flavors that you can taste . Also , it is salty enough to use as a substitute for salt the same way you would with soy sauce or a fish sauce.A little goes a long way , and especially if you are counting calories , fat or sodium intake . A serving is about a teaspoon - more than enough to mix into rice or drizzle over other dishes - and it comes in at 90 calories . That same serving contains 9 grams of fat and 440mg of sodium . So , do use sparingly if you are watching any of those nutritional factors.Another thing that I personally love is this is unfiltered . There are pieces of peppers and other ingredients that will suspend in the oil if you vigorously shake the jar before serving . Those add a lot to the flavor profile , which is predominately salty and piquant ( and there is also a distinct element of umami ) .If you love spicy sauces and oils and want to 'spice ' up your meal ( pun intended ) this is an excellent infused oil that will do the trick . I wish I could elaborate on how it works for sir frying , but I do not use it that way . I can say that it is an excellent condiment .	1
I ordered this to use in Asian cooking and have not yet had a chance to use it in a recipe . However I did sample it and seems like it will add some spice as needed .	1
I 've never used Chinese Five Spices before , but we had a holiday goose and I wanted to try it in combination with citrus to flavor the bird . It was a real winner and I loved the spice combo . In fact , I like it so much that I 'm finding other recipes just to use more of it.This brand seemed to be of good quality and fresh , as well as being reasonably priced . We live in the country and do n't have any stores that would carry such things , so I was really glad to find it online.If you 've got a recipe that calls for it , I highly recommend giving this one a shot .	1
It is good . I live in the Bahamas and a friend of mine had it and I loved what they cooked with it and I could n't buy it here so I am glad I was able to find it online .	1
I tried to find this spice and was unsuccessful . It is a great spice that I use not only in making Asian recipes but in many other dishes as well . I find it to be very versatile and an asset to my spice cupboard .	1
Excellent price and the price is very reasonable . Have used this in several Asian recipes and going to try in more savory dishes .	1
Have n't tried this yet , but it sure smells good . Ca n't wait to try it soon . Should add a new dimension to my food .	1
I had bought my first container of Dynasty Five Spices to smell . I love the aroma ! Then I started using it in my marinated cucumbers 'n ' onions . Well , it does n't last forever that way . I tried another brand of five spices but it did n't even begin to compare to Dynasty . There is n't anywhere around close where I can buy it so I was glad to find it on Amazon . True , the shipping is a little steep but I pay more than the total for spices in stores . This was worth it !	1
This is an excellent version of five-spice powder , which does not seem to follow any standard formula . I have several different ones on hand , and this is my favorite . Good flavor .	1
I purchased this wasabi powder at our local Shaw 's ( same as Albertson 's ) for $ 2.99 . It is a very practical way to buy wasabi because you can make your own wasabi for sushi simply by adding water and stirring it together in a small bowl or you can add this to mayonnaise , mustard , oil and vinegar or do whatever you please with it . This powdered wasabi has fresh flavor and it 's an easy way to keep wasabi on hand for getting creative . How about adding a small amount to a rub for seafood or steak ? Have fun with this practical grocery item that only takes up a small amount of space in your cupboard ! Or pack it in your bag when you head off for the weekend !	1
& quot ; Hime & quot ; is & quot ; Princess Brand & quot ; and it is a big seller in Japanese and Korean grocery stores . This faintly green powder is mixed with water to make a thick paste to get wasabi , used for sushi , sashimi and to flavor tuna and other dishes.One trick is to mix the wasabi in a rice bowl or tea bowl and turn the bowl upside-down . Yes , that 's what I said , turn it over . The paste will stick in the bowl , and the developing sulfurous gases that make wasabi hot , hot , hot are retained , improving the bite . Get that wasabi buzz.I like to use it in tuna with wasabi-potato crust . Or being short on time , I just grill some yellowtail and mix a wasabi-sugar-soy sauce glaze and brush it on at the end of the grilling . Hot and sweet . Another totally bizarre but quite normal Japanese dish is wasabi nori chazuke , or tea-rice . Get some leftover rice warmed up in a bowl , put a dab of wasabi and a sprinkle of sushi nori strips . Pour hot green tea ( bancha ) over and drink like a soup . Said to be a cure for hangover ( I would n't know , but they say it works . )	1
This powder is what any sushi or Ahi Tuna lover needs to compliment the fish . I mix the powder with hot chili oil and soy sauce for a marinade when making poke or Ahi Tuna ceviche .	1
I 've used this product for years - not for 'dieting ' ; but for morning regularity . I enjoy a cup of tea each night before bedtime , and am assured of daily 'relief ' ... ( lol ) . I prefer the Apricot flavor ; but other flavor choices are available - depending on one 's preference . Purchasing thru Amazon has always been more cost-worthy , and shipping always prompt .	1
Nice natural alternative to harsh laxatives . Would not call this a diet aid - it really does n't help with weight loss it just helps you go poop LOL . If you 're drinking this to aid with weight loss , you 're going to be disappointed .	1
A coworker turned me on to this product years ago . It works well ... takes away bloat and basically cleanses your system . I drink it in the evening when I know I 'm going to be home the next day . For me it works like this ... in the morning I feel the urge to go and you might think that 's the tea working . Nope its after that ... you better not be far from the potty . We call it the bomb tea because well ... you drop the bomb . ; )	1
This tea is excellent with a little vanilla stevia . Most effective if you take @ bedtime.. let bag soak for 10 minutes to get the most out of derinking it .	1
This is a real aid to getting unstuck if you get my drift and we keep reordering time after time	1
`` There are few hours in life more agreeable than the hour dedicated to the ceremony known as afternoon tea . '' -Henry James , Portrait of a LadyThis `` English Breakfast '' style tea is quite satisfying and has a rich flavor that is quite delicious.I 'd like to say that their teas are best steeped for an extra 5-10 minutes to draw out all the delicious flavors . You can use a teapot or a coffee maker to make tea . Simply put the tea in a coffee filter or the tea bags in the coffee pot , then allow the boiling water to drip over the tea leaves.The sensual blend of exotic spices , teas and herbs used in their teas include a mixture of the following : Black tea , green tea , hibiscus flowers , chamomile flowers , lemongrass , spearmint leaves , blackberry leaves , cinnamon , Rooibos , Gingerroot , rose hips , orange peel , rose petals , licorice root , safflowers , black pepper , lemon verbena leaves , cardamom , cloves , peppermint leaves , chicory , sarsaparilla root , lemon balm leaf , star anise and red poppy flowers.This is a blend of black teas , but all their teas are worth trying . Passion and Chai are also favorites.~The Rebecca Review	1
I 've been trying to ween myself off of pop , both diet & regular . And since I still need that caffeine pick up , I figured I 'd give this a try . Very nice tea taste that is n't too strong , I drink it chilled & unsweetened .	1
whenever my daughter feels like she needs a pick me up tea then this is her choice to go to .	1
This is simply put the best spice Chai tea you can get easily in the US . Hints of licorice , cinnamon , cardamom , and cloves mix well with steamed milk for a fantastic Chai latte you can make at home . Great before bedtime , or as a digestive aid , Tazo Chai is well worth the purchase .	1
****Tazo 's Chai Black Tea is an enjoyable chai experience for the most part . On the paper tea packet , Tazo writes , `` a rich blend of teas and spices in the style of the hill dwellers of the Himalayas . '' On their web site , Tazo describes the flavor profile of Chai as `` cinnamon , creamy , sweet spice '' and `` medium-bodied yet full-flavored , with the spicy kick of cinnamon , ginger , cardamom , and black pepper . Tazo describes the aroma as `` sweet , spice '' . Those are pretty accurate . The black tea `` blend '' is a little bitter , though , even with minimal brewing . It 's a real trick to get it to brew long enough to get to experience the flavor from the spices without having the tea turn bitter.The ingredients in Chai are : black teas , ginger , cinnamon , black pepper , cardamom , cloves , and star anise . It is caffeinated.Tazo is an interesting company that makes only super premium teas . They are socially responsible , based in Portland , and have the motto , `` The Reincarnation of Tea '' . Tazo is owned by Starbucks . Their web site is fun and quirky , with a Zen-type focus , definitely worth checking out . It is unclear , though , from their web site , how many of their ingredients are organic or kosher , and they do use some `` natural flavors '' in their teas -- this wording seems a little vague for a super premium tea.I would rate this tea , and Tazo in general , as good -- -better than premium teas like Stash or Celestial Seasonings -- -but not as good as Numi . I 'm soooooo spoiled by Numi teas , which is why Tazo Chai gets only four stars . ****	1
Tazo Chai Organic Spiced Black Tea is a blend of black tea , ginger , cinnamon , black pepper , cardamom , cloves and star anise . These items are all organically grown and this creates a sense of purity and clarity of thought.The tea has a delicious rich flavor and is perfectly blended for an ultimate Chai experience . Delicious when you add a packet of Stevia and a swirling of orange blossom honey . Milk powder makes this richer and a dash of cream makes it luxurious.While drinking this tea you are transported to India where Chai wallahs sooth your soul with a cup of spicy tea . Each cup of Tazo tea is an adventure and this tea is especially delicious.~The Rebecca Review	1
Perfect Starbucks tea for at home , if you like the tea at the store you ca n't go wrong with this .	1
In many languages around the world , `` chai '' simply means `` tea . '' In India , however , the word denotes a specialty that to tea lovers even in the West is fast becoming what cappuccino already is to coffee lovers : spiced milk tea.Chai comes in a variety of recipes that differ from region to region , although traditionally it consists of a blend of black tea , rich milk , various spices and a sweetner . The spices most commonly used are cardamom , cinnamon , ginger , cloves and pepper ; Tazo 's very peppery Chai adds rooibos , vanilla , star anise and chicory to the traditional recipe.You should always have this tea with real sugar , even if you have all your regular tea without any kind of sweetener , because only sugar will bring out the full flavor of the spices . And if you like your store-bought Chai , maybe you 'll one day try brewing chai from fresh black tea and spices , too ! Namaste ...	1
I am simply wild about Tazo Wild Sweet Orange Tea . This herbal tea is so good . Granted , you do n't have the seeds to spit out afterwards ( like you would if you were eating an actual orange ) but details , details , details ! This is a great tea to have on hand for guests and is great when served with biscuits . I am thinking any plain butter cookie , so it compliments the flavor of the tea . The ingredients , for the discriminating tea sipper are : lemongrass , blackberry leaves , rosehips , spearmint , orange essence -- and other herbs , spices and natural flavors . All of these flavors go so well together . You wo n't be disappointed .	1
I love orange flavored teas and this is one of the best that I 've had where the flavor is powerful once the tea is brewed .	1
This is the only tea I have found that has a sharp orange flavor . It also has a mint flavor . I love drinking it when eating a chocolate desert . But it 's good anytime . I love it .	1
I drink all kinds of non-black decaf teas . A friend of mine brought some of this Wild Sweet Orange for me to try . OMG ! Just the smell from the teabag is delicious ! And that incredible taste carries over into the actual brewed tea ( unlike coffee , for example , where the beans smell incredible but then you brew them and it 's just ..eh. ) . It 's the smell and flavor of a ripe orange - without any acidity . It 's simply delicious . Anyway , as soon as I tried it , I bought a box . And then another . I love it .	1
****Tazo 's Wild Sweet Orange Herbal Infusion is a nice orange herbal tea . It contains lemongrass , blackberry leaves , citric acid , rose hips , spearmint leaves , natural flavors , orange peel , safflowers , hibiscus flowers , rose petals , natural orange essence , ginger root and licorice root . It is not sweet , very fruity , and not subtle at all , a wonderful tea if you enjoy orangey teas.Tazo is an interesting company that makes only super premium teas . They are socially responsible , based in Portland , and have the motto , `` The Reincarnation of Tea '' . Tazo is owned by Starbucks . Their web site is fun and quirky , with a Zen-type focus , definitely worth checking out . It is unclear , though , from their web site , how many of their ingredients are organic or kosher , and they do use some `` natural flavors '' in their teas -- this wording seems a little vague for a super premium tea.On the paper tea packet , Tazo writes , `` a lively blend of sweet citrus herbs and orange essences . Sweet , yet tart , this is a cup of liquid sunshine , radiating multi-layered orange flavors with exotic hints of spice and a distinctive floral finish . Wild , indeed . '' On their web site , Tazo describes the flavor profile of Wild Sweet Orange as `` tart , sweet , smooth , licorice '' . Tazo describes the aroma as `` oranges , roses , lime '' . This is pretty accurate , although the words give hope that the taste of the tea never quite approaches.I would rate this tea , and Tazo in general , as good -- -better than premium teas like Stash or Celestial Seasonings -- -but not as good as Numi . I 'm soooooo spoiled by Numi teas , which is why Tazo Wild Sweet Orange gets only four stars . ****	1
Normally I hate yucky flowery herbs like hibiscus and rosehips and mint in my tea ( such as Celestial Seasonings Tea ) but one day while at Starbuck 's , I was hot and wanted an iced drink but not coffee and since I 'm really a tea drinker , I tried their Tazo iced teas and they tasted SOOOOO good with just the purrrrfect balance of just enough herbs but still letting your senses know it was still TEA and the orange with mint fragrance/taste comes out boldly ! ! The heated tea is nicely turned immediately , boldly , vividly , orange in color . I do n't need to add much sweetener even as it 's tart but its tartness gives it more taste.The only drawbacks are its high price ( compared to other teas which is why I 'm always waiting for a sale on them ) and having to wait to heat the water and waiting to cool it down in the refrigerator ( or quickly in the freezer ) . It 's true as another reviewer said that it 's very strong in taste after just leaving it in hot water for a few seconds so the longer you leave it in , the stronger and bitter or more tart it becomes and you could really be frugal and only need a tea bag for a half gallon to a gallon of water . Adding ice helps dilute the taste as well as cool the tea down fast and cold , but I like my iced tea strong so i can taste its full flavor , so I try never to add ice.It 's a delight as an everyday iced tea as well as a great gift for a friend .	1
This is the story of two Tazo teas . I found that they almost need one another to produce a tea of exceptional quality.I tried each tea separately and finally blended them together . Tazo Lotus and Tazo Wild Sweet Orange make a wonderful lemony hot tea in the winter or enjoy being tossed about with ice cubes in the summer.The way I make this tea is by steeping two Lotus and two Wild Sweet Orange filterbags with 16 ounces of water . I make this in my coffee maker so there is plenty of time for the flavors to seep out into the steaming water . Then , you can add 2 tablespoons of orange blossom honey for hot tea and a bit more for ice tea.Drinking this blend is an aromatic experience . Lotus Decaffeinated Green tea is a blend of naturally decaffeinated green tea , natural lotus flower flavor and other natural flavors . Wild Sweet Orange is a blend of lemongrass , blackberry leaves , citric acid , rose hips , spearmint leaves , natural flavors , orange peel , safflowers , hibiscus flowers , rose petals , natural orange essence , ginger root and licorice root.I love the crinkly sound of the paper bags protecting the precious contents . The boxes are also quite intriguing and the stories on the tea packets are always mysterious and playful.A romantic tea with a golden-orange color . I can never decide if I like this best hot or cold , so I end up drinking it hot and cold . Half on ice and half in a mug . When this tea is hot , it is much more romantic and aromatic . When chilled it takes on a more bitter component.For something even more exotic , try the Tazo Green Ginger tea . That was the first Tazo tea I tasted and so far I ca n't think of a Tazo tea I do n't love.~The Rebecca Review	1
It 's wintertime and there 's nothing better than a hot cup of tea on a cold winter 's day . Tazo 's `` Wild Sweet Orange '' has been a favorite tea of mine for almost 10 years now . I first got a sip of Tazo when we lived in Portland , OR and I learned from the natives that a hot cup of tea from a local vendor was better than a pair of gloves to keep you warm . I still love `` Wild Sweet Orange '' especially with just a hint of cinnamon to pick up the flavor .	1
We buy a lot of herbal infusions in our family because I 'm a day in , day out coffee drinker and when I 'm not drinking coffee I prefer a non-caffeinated drink.My husband lovesBigelow Constant Comment Tea , 40-Count Boxes ( Pack of 6 ) , which I grew up on and he never tried until I suggested it . So when I look for herbal teas for him , I keep that in mind.So an orange/spice tea is a natural choice for him . This is a sweet , very orange-y tea that 's nicely spicy . It 's fragrant enough to smell even with a head cold and it is a family favorite.Like all Tazo teas , the color is lovely . The scent is orange/cinnamon , the flavor is orange/sweet/spicy . One tea bag works well with up to 14 oz of boiling water.Individually wrapped , I usually keep a bag or two in my purse for when we are some place that offers hot water but no teas that we like .	1
Was served this at a hotel while traveling was very happy to find it available on Amazon . Nice fruity flavor to enjoy on a warm summer afternoon . Served it over ice , the slightly tart flavor tickled my taste buds and refreshed me .	1
I 'm not a tea expert , but I know what I like , and this is it . This is a flavored black tea with notes of citrus and vanilla , a bit like panettone cake or King Arthur 's `` fiore di sicilia '' flavoring . It 's a bit similar to Earl Grey but without that resinous aftertaste and more of a vanilla undertone . Just in the canister , the tea smells perfumed and perhaps overly-flavored , but brewed , the taste of the tea itself becomes more prominent , making a dark , rich , full-bodied brew with an enchantingly subtle flavor profile . It takes a bit of milk handily without turning weak and watery , and re-brews nicely ( though re-brews do n't take milk as well ) . It chills well ; I prefer it plain when it 's cold . It tastes delicious with breakfast and also at any time of the day . Its ability to re-brew makes it more economical a choice , too.As black flavored teas go , this one 's a keeper for me . I will definitely purchase it again and I recommend it heartily to tea drinkers .	1
I enjoy it - not for cold tea , though . It is very nice hot . The leaves themselves smell almost perfumed , at first I could n't get past that . But once I made my first cup of tea with it none of that mattered anymore . Glad I ordered it	1
This tea definitely has a strong and distinct flavor . It is not for everyone , but if you like a strong Earl Grey you will like this . The vendor delivered the product quickly and in perfect condition .	1
I love this tea . If you think you would like a mix of black currant , vanilla , caramel , and bergamot , then this is for you . It has a nice gentle taste and is perfect for the afternoon or evening . I would describe it as a light tea in terms of strength of flavor . I am sure I will be buying it again .	1
At first I did not like this tea it was very potent and had a funny after taste . I was steeping the tea for 5 minutes . So , I visited the Harney and Sons website . A reviewer at their website recommended steeping in BOILING water for no more than 3 minutes . Voila , the tea was transformed . The subtle flavors of vanilla and bergamot came thru and I really like this tea .	1
I like it a lot , I purchased it in bag before , but the loose tea it 's nice to be able to dose it the way you want ( a small cup or a whole pot ) . If you like Earl gray / Bergamot , give it a try , the fruity flavors add a nice touch.Would buy it again at the right price .	1
Takes longer than store tea bags , but the flavor is excellent and nice aroma . All these flavors are good . Love it	1
fragrant , evocative , delicious and very lovely . These are not words usually used to describe tea . I am sure this tea is loaded with who knows what flavorings & spices etc but in a steaming cup , this is heaven . with some milk , heaven plus	1
I like the seasoning , and bought it on Amazon because they did n't have it at my local store . Now , I find it , and it 's a much lower price at my local store . So , if you do n't have access to it , this would be they place to buy .	1
I grew up on the east coast , and it just is n't Thanksgiving without Bell 's . I use it all the time with chicken , fish & turkey . It is not available locally ( the midwest ) so I am happy that I can get it through Amazon.This way I do n't have to bother my family back east with sending it.I love it ! Give it a try .	1
I found a fried chicken recipe that has a poultry seasoning in ingredients in it and so I bought this to try . My fried chicken is okay but not that great . So far , that is the only time I use this seasoning perhaps next time I will try it on roast chicken . Overall it was good .	1
Good price for an old standby spice blend . Used this for yrs just at thanksgiving but found I can use this on all my chicken dishes to enhance the chicken flavors and gravies .	1
Need I say more ? Bell 's has always been the standard , as long as I can remember , when it comes to poultry seasoning . It does the job .	1
My market does not carry Bell 's seasoning , perhaps its only sold in NYC ? ? ? ? Perhaps I need to find a new market ? Either way , it was a bit pricey but since for me its an indispensable scent for Thanksgiving , albeit it 's March right now , I bought it to stock my seasoning pantry .	1
All the ingredients were very finely ground which made for easy application . The herbs were super fresh and so pungent the UPS van must have smelled like Thanksgiving all day . My dogs ran to the door to greet the UPS driver and stopped in their tracks when they caught a whiff . They were so wide eyed and all sniffing the box . Everyone commented on the stuffing . Thanks for the memories Bell Co.P.S.Mix a pinch or two in your dumpling mix for prize winning Chicken and Dumplings .	1
Bell & # 8217 ; s is the Turkey seasoning from our ancestors . It & # 8217 ; s gotten harder to find as new Turkey cooking seasonings and cooking methods evolve . Bell & # 8217 ; s delivers the taste like grandma & # 8217 ; s and aromatizes the house when cooked . It keeps the saliva glands slathering in pre-meal slather .	1
I had always heard about this seasoning but never tried it . I am so glad I did . It really wakes up the flavor of any poultry dish . I highly recommend this product .	1
I really like Bell 's All Natural Seasoning . What I do not like is the packaging . As far as I can tell , the package has not been changed in seventy years . It is difficult to open . I think the ease with which one can spill a lot of product has some relationship to the lack of any upgrade in packaging.That said , Bell 's is my favorite all-around seasoning . I transfer a package of Bell 's to the Kamenstein Colored Magnetic Storage Jars , that I have also reviewed , immediately after unpacking . That seems to keep it fresher , and certainly more available for use , rather than spillage .	1
I 've ordered a lot of gum off Amazon , many different brands and flavors . This is my favorite . I think anywhere you buy gum , sometimes you get a stale pack or batch , but overall I 've been happy enough with the quality and freshness to keep ordering it time and again .	1
I usually do not like sugarless gum - but Orbit has a nice flavor and it has a nice texture to it ... My favorite is the peppermint - the sweet mint is VERY mild if you are looking for a less strong mint flavor . Best price is here .74 cents a pack !	1
I 'm a bit of an compulsive gum chewer so having stashes all over the house and at work have turned into a trend . Comes in 2 standard sizes boxes with 12 packs in each box . Always concerned with things like these when buying in bulk that they may be stale . Everything was perfectly fresh and should keep me happily chewing for the next few months .	1
This is the best tasting mint gum I 've found to date . So many have a harsh flavor but this one is smooth and sweet while still having plenty of minty flavor ! It reminds me of the smooth mint flavor ofLifeSavers Hard Wint-O-Greencandies . It keeps its flavor and consistency for a long time as well . Great gum !	1
Great for the car . Use in the office.Taste was fresh not stale./ Will order more when out due to the great price .	1
There are only a couple groceries store that offer Orbit at this price , that I 've seen . The only benefit to getting them cheaper is if you need the variety . I have my favorites , so I decided to buy this pack from Amazon . Taste pretty nummers , and I got them for a great price . No complaints here . A+	1
Came right on time . By far my favorite gum that ORBIT carries ! I do n't need any of this tropical banana split nonsense ! Straight up Spearmint will do the trick for me ! It is a TINY BIT over priced ... as I can get it at a store here for $ 10.99 a box ... but hey , I love this gum so much that it does n't bother me I paid an extra dollar per each box !	1
Simply the best sugar free peppermint gum that you can buy . The packages are very sleek , and easy for pocket carrying . This gum retains it 's flavor for a great long time . I might be a fool for great package art work , but I love the gum box designs . The price is also right	1
I know I chew too much gum , but I really like this gum.1 . At over 50 I still blow bubbles2 . It has a slight mint flavor3 . Still tastes like bubble gum .	1
Think big red when you order this gum . Did you grow up chewing big red and remember people or kisses related to it ? If so you will welcome the smell and tingly of this cinnamon gum . I will probably order this again from amazon sooner than the 6 months I set it to subscribe . Tasty and when you open the pack the whole car smells warm and cinnamonly	1
I love the taste of Orbit 's Cinnamint Sugarfree Gum ! ! ! The flavor lasts , and its good for your teeth ; including your dental work .	1
Fresh breath , long lasting flavor , does n't become rubber hard after 20 minutes of chewing like so many other brands . In fact I can chew on two sticks all day and feel satisfied .	1
I like this gum . It has good flavor . I keep it hidden in my office drawer so that I can have a quick freshen up at work when I need it .	1
This is my favorite gum . It maintains its flavor for a very long time , and also remains pleasingly elastic when chewed . Other gum I 've tried becomes tough shortly after you begin chewing .	1
You are VERY lucky if you find a gum that does n't have its flavor vanish before you 've gotten in a bunch of chews . Orbit cinnamon has a lot of flavor and you can actually sit down while chewing . With other gums , you do n't even reach your chair before you run out of flavor and have to get up to toss it away . Best of all , it 's sugar free -- that 's zero calories . Ca n't get better than that .	1
I have been buying these from Amazon forever . Very tasty and the sweetness lasts a long time . It 's also good after a meal as it helps freshen your breath and get the food out of your teeth . But be very careful around your dogs as the sweetener in these is poisonous to dogs and perhaps other animals .	1
I sent these to our troops in Afghanistan who wanted gum and I am sure they are very pleased . The price is great .	1
Orbit is my favorite gum , and this is the best price available anywhere I have found . I prefer sweet mint but this is good too .	1
my favorite gum . very original bubble gum flavor with a hint of mint . the mint is little not over powering the bubble gum flavor .	1
Housemate specifically wanted this flavor and thought it was a good deal.I like it too ... good chew , good flavor , nice size , lasts long enough . Lots of it !	1
I bought these for my wife who is a `` gumaholic '' . She absolutely prefers this brand and this flavor , peppermint . Though spearmint is cheaper , this is her choice . The price is so much better than buying one pack at a time at local stores . She says it does not leave a bad after taste and takes away a smokers breath .	1
I like keeping this in stock . It does n't leave my teeth feeling fuzzy after I chew it and it 's a great minty clean feeling .	1
In my opinion , the Sweetmint Sugarfree Gum is the best flavor made by Orbit . The taste is wonderfully sweet and flavorful and lasts longer than any other brand of sugar-free gum I have tried . The fact that it is better for your teeth , being free of sugar , is only icing on the cake !	1
After the dentyne fire variety this was dull n does n't last as long . Not bad if u ca n't stand the stuff that burns	1
Brussel 's Golden Gate Ficus Indoor Bonsai TreeI am really satisfied with the tree . I always thought these would be a bit more expensive . Like nearly all plants needs light , inderect outside shady best , inside near window probably good .	1
I HAVE READ OTHER REVIEWS ABOUT THE SHIPPING AND ARRIVAL NOT BEING OF GOOD QUALITY ... .THIS IS NOT THE CASE W/ MINE . MY TREE ARRIVED ON TIME , NOT DAMAGED , AND IT LOOKED GREAT . THIS IS AN EXCELLENT TREE FOR A STARTER BONSAI NOVALIST TO A PRO.update- may , 2008 -- -tree was so nice that ordered 2 more	1
I do n't normally give a review on the condition of an item as it arrives from shipping much less one I gave as a gift , but I simply must pass this on.I bought the ficus from Brussel 's Bonsai . It being a tree , I wondered if the tree would make it to my mom in one piece . Well , my mom called me today . She just got the tree and she is thrilled beyond belief . She said it arrived in absolutely perfect condition , as if someone had hand delivered it . She still ca n't get over how it was possible . She said it arrived in a huge box , but it was just a little tree and it looked perfect . They had packed it so well . I told her to send it back if there 's anything wrong with it , but she said no , it is PERFECT . Knowing my mom , she would have told me if it wasn't.UPDATE : I 've had three trees sent as gifts to family and they have been an absolute hit ! Usually , I get a nice , polite thank you ; but this time it is call after call from people who are at a loss for words , just like my mom . Rarely does a present garner so much positive feedback . Thank you , Amazon !	1
sunflower seeds are very good for your health..look up the health benefits on the internet and see this on doctor oz..	1
man ! im loving these ! and with raisens its like a little slice of heaven in my mouth ! I will be buying these over and over !	1
Wow i mean Wow 5 lbs . of raw hulled sunflower seed kernels is a lot . They are very good seeds and I will have no problem using them , its amazing when you have a lot of something around you find more uses , next time you are pan frying something through some in nice added feature and taste	1
The sunflower seeds are fresh and tasty and 5 lbs is a lot . I love that they were shipped priority and arrived so quickly ! They are conveniently packaged in a zip lock bag , need to be careful opening package so that you do not puncture it , kind of a no brainer . Very pleased with the product , cost and quick service . Will reorder these when needed .	1
Not much to say here . Good price for a good product . Arrived quickly . And no need to get the kernel out of the shell , just eat !	1
who does n't love sunflower seeds ? i got these to work in homemade granola , and they 're working awesome . they add just the right amount of extra crunch and flavor ... .	1
I love almond flavored desserts and knowing that this is organic makes me feel better . I sometimes use this as a substitute for vanilla when making muffins , pancakes , and other baked goods . I 've even used it in smoothies .	1
This product arrived in good condition and it is exactly what I was looking for . I live almond flavor in some of my recipes but dislike the synthetic kind . This product fits my requirement perfectly .	1
Very pleased with the quality of this extract as almond flavor is hard to & # 34 ; nail & # 34 ; without an unpleasant aftertaste in your prepared product . This is great .	1
I use almond extract in many family recipes . This extract gives a wonderful almond taste . The brand is certified organic , and donates a percentage of its sales to support organic farming and education .	1
I needed this to make my mother-in-law 's pound cake . It works great and does n't have that strange taste that some of the extracts get . Definitely will buy it again .	1
This brand is a favorite of mine . Good quality almond extract . Great price . The bottle showed up in perfect condition as well .	1
I loved this . It smells wonderful and taste even better . I purchased it because I had never bought organic extract before this .	1
I love using almond extract in desserts featuring chocolate , cherry , or both . It really enhances those flavors . This particular brand has a wonderful taste , and even better , it is organic.Simply Organic is a brand I use a lot for extracts , and this was an excellent purchase . Highly recommended .	1
This is the most incredible almond extract I 've ever purchased ! I put it in everything including my coffee to make chemical free almond coffee ... a much better alternative than Dunkin !	1
First of all , I love to use organic products . I am so tired of seeing our food supply come to us contaminated with pesticides , fungicides , etc . It is wonderful to find products being grown organically and using sustainable agriculture . The almond extract is excellent , and I will be buying more from Simply Organics in the future .	1
There are times when I want something with kick but do n't want the harsh taste of a lot of other hot sauces and this is perfect . As others have mentioned , be very careful of how much you add to your food as it has a serious kick . I also like to add this to other hot sauces to kick them up a notch . For example , this is great to add to Franks hot sauce .	1
one little toothpick drop of sauce on a piece of chicken and I knew that I best place this bottle on a shelf only to be brought out when company comes over and someone starts bragging about how they can stand any hot pepper.I love extreme hot sauces can compete with the best of ya 'll in withstanding the internal torture . I am however , not stupid . Use this stuff with caution .	1
Dave 's Ghost Pepper Hot Sauce is the hottest sauce i 've ever had . All that is required to send your mouth on fire is one drop . I just had a dab and my tongue was on fire.This sauce is made with the Hottest Pepper in the World , The Naga Jolokia.It was n't so hot I could n't handle it but i 'm sure if I had more than that dab I 'd be in for more than I could handle . The sensation from the dab lasted a good 15 minutes.The sauce contains the ghost pepper , hot pepper extract , salt , vegetable oil , roasted garlic pulps and acetic acid . It 's a delicious addition to many foods- especially sauces , meat and ethnic foods . Not for people with heart/respiratory problems.Amazon has the best price i 've seen on the sauce so far . So , if you like it spicy and you want to try a sauce with the Ghost Pepper in it , I Highly Recommend it ... If you can handle it , that is .	1
Ok I am shocked at my response to this . It is n't that bad for me . I guess everyone is different . It has a pleasant heat and I get NO after heat . Is it hot ? Yes , but not too hot . And very flavorful , you do get the fruit undertones.The one criticism I have and it is something to be aware of , the bottle is a normal bottle . This means getting a drop or just a few is virtually impossible . It flows out . It is also a great price . So my advice is try a bottle . It may be too hot , it may not . But surprisingly to me my body handles it just fine .	1
First a warning , if you are not a true chili head , this sauce will overpower you and cause you pain ! Dave 's insanity products are called insane for good reason , they take hot up a dozen notches to thermonuclear ! This sauce could easily have adopted the old Brylcream slogan `` a little dab 'll do ya '' cause this stuff you use one small drop at a time . Just a few drops in a quart of tomato sauce and it was too hot for several of my friends . So heed the warning about the heat . However , if you are a true lover of hell 's wrath in your body , this is the stuff ! Incredible heat , but it also has a great taste . If you are not faint of heart , give this a try !	1
This stuff is very hot ! It will burn your face off ! It also has a sort of Habenaro pepper flavor to it . I love it when my friends come over and find this stuff . They all think they can handle it but boy are they in for a surprise ! I do n't use it often as it does n't seem to have much of a flavor . If & # 34 ; Melt Your Mouth & # 34 ; could be a flavor , that 's what this would be ! You do n't need but a few drops .	1
I am writing this as a person who can eat extremely spicy food . If you think Tabasco is hot , read no further as this sauce is not for you.I vaguely recall the first time I tasted this sauce , putting the end of a toothpick in the thick dark concoction and dabbing it onto my tongue and experiencing a very unpleasant feeling . That was then . Now I can easily put a generous drop on each bite of my sandwich or pizza , even with my morning eggs sometimes . Yes , I am addicted to hot sauce and I will say that I have tried hundreds of different kinds . This one , in my opinion , is the most flavorful while still delivering a good slap of heat.I know there are some die-hard Blair fans out there . I will try and compare the two in as simple a way as I can . While I prefer Dave 's for the reasons mentioned above , I do acknowledge that Blair has managed to get much `` hotter '' mixtures and have a more of a `` gen-x '' or `` bad ass '' marketing campaign . They will offer you insanely hot sauces , that are n't really sauces because they 're simply pure extract . Anyone can make extract that 'll make your rectum erupt , but to make a sauce that is actually flavorful is the kicker . The closest sauce to Dave 's Insanity would probably be After Death . The spice level is pretty similar , but Blair 's has a grainy , almost sandy texture to it that kind of eats away at your palette . My experience with Dave 's has been the opposite , as it is smooth and has a nice texture to it.It all really comes down to preference , but as long as you have a good heat tolerance , this one delivers that and great flavor too .	1
`` Dave 's Insanity Sauce '' is not to be taken casually or even as a way to add heat to individual servings , this is meant for larger dishes such as a whole pot of chili or a big batch of salsa since one or two drops will make a large amount of food VERY hot . That being said , this does have a really good flavor that adds a nice pepper tangy hit that complements most Mexican or South-Western dishes , but I would n't use it in Indian or Chinese style dishes.There are several amusing and somewhat painful to watch videos of people abusing this sauce on various web sites and a quick search will provide you with a lot of hits.Highly Recommended ! CFH	1
I 've tried the `` normal '' Dave 's Insanity Sauce in the past and always enjoyed exposing someone new to the delight that just a little bit can bring . It 's one of those sauces that you can put a little on a toothpick and watch someone 's face light up as the heat arrives . So when I saw that Dave 's had a Ghost Pepper based sauce I was excited to see just what it was going to bring to the table . The answer is pure smokey heat.The first time I tried it I was very sparing with it , putting just a couple of drops on a few slices of pizza and spreading them out . The result was that I could taste the heat but not really the flavor of the sauce . The next time I decided to just sprinkle 8 to 10 drops of the sauce over a few slices and I got the full throttled effect . The sauce is hot , make no mistake about that . It starts out hot and continues to linger , allowing each additional bite to add to the burn . A nice greasy , cheesy pizza is the perfect delivery method as the fats in the cheese try to keep your tongue from burning up , but to no avail as it is just temporary relief . I found each bite to get hotter and the sweat started to pour . The amazing thing to me was that even with the heat level I was still enjoying the taste of the pizza and the sauce.The bottom line is if you like hot sauce HOT , this is good stuff . Nice and hot with a delicious smokey flavor that I really enjoyed . It may be the heat of legends , but if you use it wisely you 'll get the burn and suffer no ill effects afterwards . Give it a try !	1
I bought this for my Uncle , because he LOVES HOT PEPPERS ! He has a garden and always has a variety of peppers growing . He even started me on my own lil pepper plants . So how do I repay him ? With a bottle of death ... I called he says its good , just `` alittle warm . '' I think that translates to it gives you hot poop the next day .	1
Someone sitting next to me at a tacqueria doused their taco with this stuff , just like regular piquante , took a bite , and then paid the price for the next twenty minutes . Learning from his misfortune , I took a few tinefulls ( on the tip of a fork ) on my taco . . . not even a full drop as recommended . Just the perfect amount . Two hours later , I still feel a nice lingering heat.As for flavor , I think serranos have a better flavor , but this was n't bad . I definitely would put a very very small on any food where I wanted that perfect amount of `` burn '' .You also may notice that only people from Texas and California have written reviews . This sauce really is for people who grew up eating Mexican and Southwestern food . I do n't know if a New Yorker or someone from the Mid West would enjoy this stuff .	1
Let me start off this review by saying I love spicy food . If I go to an Asian restaurant , I 'm the guy who asks for spicyness at a level 4/5 or 5/5 . Ok.. now that we have that taken care of : this stuff is HOT.How hot you ask ? If I put a toothpick into it and put it at the tip of my tongue , there is noticeable heat . When it comes time to eat a meal , I prefer to put a drop or so into my individual portion to get really freakin noticeable heat . The stuff is no joke . If you use it like Frank 's Red Hot , you will probably die . 100 percent recommended if you like things HOT .	1
Jolokia peppers are rated as the hotest peppers in the world . This is a newer entry in the extreme hot sauce category and must be used with care . I once gave a bottle of a slightly less hot Dave 's Insanity Sauce to a friend who claimed he liked things hot . He used it like he would use his normal hot sauce and almost set himself on fire . This particular sauce should be used a drop at a time in chili or similar foods until you determine your tolerance . Keep a cold drink nearby , and be careful not to burn a hole through your chair .	1
I love Hot stuff and this stuff really works . If your friends think they like hot stuff , give them some of this with no warning . It 's fun ...	1
but also very temporaryMega heat , without the lasting burn of other sauces , which means I can consume more in less time .	1
People say that it may not be hot enough but this stuff has it in the hot department . It seems like the super hot sauces impact over bit of time and get hotter and hotter . Also , it may be good not to eat a lot before you know the effect on your body . It gives me some gurgling and peculating , hot in the butt and a fever glow to me entire body.I suggest putting a spoon of this onto regular wing sauce .	1
Low sodium hot sauce that tastes good . Need I say more ? 15mg of sodium per teaspoon . Has a bit of a kick to it but it is not super duper hot . Really adds a good flavor to my food . And yay for Amazon having it .	1
All the other sauces were hot , but we wanted to try this one . We used 9 drops in home made wing sauce ( about a cup of wing sauce ) . This is powerful , using as directed is a must . We started with one drop and worked our way up to 9 drops in a cupfull of wing sauce . 9 drops are perfect for us . This most definitely has a heat and kick of it 's own kind . If you like HOT and I mean standing on the sun hot , this is for you ... but do use it as directed on the bottle and start small .	1
This sauce is HOT . It is obviously not made for just plopping on your food , more likely mixing in a large bowl of chili ( or for pranking your friends ) . Although this stuff is RIDICULOUSLY hot , it actually has some taste compared to other sauces of similar potency . I has an interesting smokey flavor and tastes like straight-up jolokia . Doing the toothpick test with this is bearable , but the heat sneaks up on you about 2-3 minutes in and it lingers for eternity . Wherever you placed the toothpick will temporarily feel like you actually burned it there . Yeah , its hot ! Please know what you are getting into if you buy this . It is a sauce with extract in it and is VERY hot . The especially sneaky part is that the temperature creeps up on you and takes a few minutes to really kick . This is not a sauce you would put directly on your food like tobasco or something . Be warned !	1
$ 6 a bottle may seem allot at first , but when you only use a drop or two , it is a real bargain.I love pepper sauces , I grow peppers and make my own , but I can never concentrate it to this level.I like to use a couple of drops of this Ghost Pepper and mix it into mustard or BBQ sauce for a great kick.Has a unique flavor , I am happy with my purchase .	1
i normally slice habaneros and add them to my food when i want something supremely spicy . i am an indian girl after all and can handle anything you throw at me in the spice dept.this was just as hot as habaneros and so much better than having to slice the habaneros and then worry about touching something and screaming from pain ( ie taking my contacts out ... ... ) delicious sauce that delivers the HEAT ! ! !	1
I told my son to apply one a single drop to try it out , not a glop of hot sauce -- which he instantly regretted . On a scale of 1 to 10 , 1 being faintly noticeable heat , to 10 being OMG I 'm on FIRE ! this is a 10 . Good s*** .	1
This is some really hot crap ! I use it in a bowl of soup , chicken and dumplins , etc . to add some flavor . Poor as little as you can to test . One tiny drip on my eggs is plenty !	1
Come on , read the label . One of the manufacturer 's suggested uses is removal of driveway oil stains.For the last five years or so , I have always had a bottle of this sauce on hand specifically for those friends who swear nothing is ever too hot . The ultimate gratification comes from watching as they disregard any admonishments that direct consumption of any amount greater than a swab on a toothpick is too much . It is particularly helpful to quiet those who can not refrain from talking over movies or provide undesired running commentary during sports events . Invariably , for next hour their only objective is to regain the ability to breathe normally . The only downside is this ploy only works once.I like to mix about an 1/8 of a teaspoon with two ounces of regular hot sauce for buffalo wings , or add a dab to any taco sauce , however care is required because you can easily reach a point of diminishing returns as the unavoidable numbing of one 's tastebuds makes enjoyment of the food impossible .	1
My husband is such a fan of hot sauces , I ca n't believe he even has any tastebuds left . However , this is his favorite hot sauce . People are always bringing him hot sauces from their travels , or giving him unusual ones they run across . This remains his favorite . His gasping , eye-watering , favorite ! The warnings are real ... do use with caution ... even from picking up the ( apparently clean and dry ) bottle to put it back in the fridge , I 've touched my lips later and noticed a burning sensation .	1
Naga Jolokia is a lot hotter than 'Temporary Insanity ' , it ca n't be dispensed like pasta sauce the way 'Temporarity Insanity & # 34 ; can . But a few drops on a single plate , or a quick pour into a stir fry sauce ( during cooking ) works great.I also love that beyond being just hot , it has a subtle yet distinctive earthy smell/taste to it	1
If you like a great , hot , sauce then buy this . If spicy with heat is n't to your liking then do n't buy it .	1
decent sauce , not nearly as spicy as i thought it would be . if you have ever had a straight up naga jolokia and expect this to be as hot , you will be disappointed .	1
I 'm a huge pepper connoisseur so naturally , this was my next step . The feared Ghost Pepper ! I almost underestimated it 's kick as I used it for the first time . I three nice drops on my salmon and ate away like it was regular hot sauce . Let 's just say , good thing I had some tissue near by . LMAO.This pepper really has earned it 's name and reputation . It 's an awesome sauce for only the brave and those who truly enjoy spicy food .	1
I do n't use hot sauce . Tabasco is almost too hot for me . But my husband loves hot sauce ... The hotter the better and he says this stuff is hot . He barely touched his finger to the rim of the bottle for a taste and said it was the hottest he had tried so far . That tells me one thing ... there is NO WAY I can eat this . Good news , it 's all his to enjoy which he said is just fine by him .	1
I will preface this review with a little about myself . I only recently bought a `` hottest sauce '' while at a kind of flea market in England . It was also a ghost pepper sauce and i was shocked at the intensity of the burn . At first I was sort of proud of myself for being able to use it , but it did grow on me and I started using it as an actual condiment . After the bottle ran out I thought I would see what was on Amazon and this sauce was ranked very highly so I bought it . So I really only have one other sauce to compare this to but here goes : The sauce is very hot . Almost too hot . It has a pasty consistency , almost exactly like tomato paste . Very finely ground . It has a more gummy consistency to it , like theres something added to it to give it a smoother texture though there 's no such actual ingredient.What there is , however , as someone else pointed out , is pepper extract . It 's the second listed ingredient so there must be a considerable amount . Perhaps it 's what 's giving this sauce that slimy texture I was eluding to earlier . This Pepper Extract does n't state what KIND of pepper , and as it 's an extract I imagine it must have gone through quite the extraction process.So what I 'm getting at is this : the sauce feels more like a pepper extract , something which you should add small amounts of to large dishes for adding pure spice to the food . But it 's missing the taste and feel of an actual hot sauce . There 's little flavor , just a lot of burn . And I have to say that that 's a big shame because the bhut jolokia pepper is very tasty . Almost fruity if I remember correctly.So I give this hot sauce 4 stars for the Effort and the level of spice , but I wo n't give it 5 stars because I think that goes to the generic bhut jolokia ghost pepper sauces with all the scary names and pictures on the bottle . The one I had was Fear Hot Sauce with a scary ghost woman on it , and it was much more like salsa , with little ground up pieces of ghost peppers and seeds in it and equal to , if not more burn than this one.If I change my mind as I go through this bottle , I 'll update or comment on here again .	1
I put this in the category of 'super spicy sauces ' - but - I do n't think it is by any means too spicy.Flavor is n't too bad , a sort of smoky tomato base flavor . More than anything , the heat comes through.This is pretty good for spicing up soups , chilies , etc . However , not really all that good for spicing up a sandwich or something , not because it is too hot , just do n't care for the flavor that much 'straight up . 'All said , this is better than your average 'super spicy ' sauce . Most seem to just have the awful capsaicin extract flavor ( and nothing else ) , which to me is inedible due to the terrible taste , not even the heat . Dave 's really is n't bad , but not my favorite either .	1
I like heat in my food . Every so often , I try to ramp up . A year ago , I tried my first habanero pepper . Boy , did that set a standard ! Forget jalapenos and so on . Then , as I read further about hot peppers , I came across references to ghost pepper . Habaneros are hot ; we grew some habaneros in our garden this past year . As you parse them into dishes in a sensible manner , you get heat and they also support flavor.I just got this product a week ago . I immediately used it with a pasta dish served at my place of employment . Two drops with the pasta -- stirred so that the pepper sauce was spread evenly throughout the dish.Oh , boy ! A nice heat . After finishing my dish , there was a light burn on my lips and at the back of my mouth . The sauce did not obscure the taste of the dish , but actually added an additional element . In addition , my forehead was moist from perspiration and my nose started running . But a small price to pay ! This is a fine addition to my kitchen . I underdid the portion earlier today with an omelet , but I got it right with diced potatoes and onions for dinner . I am still learning , but I think that I will be routinely ordering this in the future as my current bottle is emptied .	1
This is for very experienced hot sauce eaters only , this is some of the hottest Naga Jolokia sauce there is , a few drops and then there is a delayed reaction of a few seconds before the heat and burn hits you but it will . This sauce can be managed but it demands respect . If your looking for the hottest sauce out there this does n't even come close to some of the other extreme heat sauces on the market which must be due to the way the make the sauce as the pepper itself is the hottest . The heat overpowers the flavor on this one also .	1
It seems like there is a new `` Hottest Pepper in the World '' every couple of years or so . Not too long ago it was the Red Savina Habanero with a Scoville heat rating of 577,000 units . Now it is the Naga Jolokia ( also known as the Naga Morris , Nai Miris , Bih Jolokia and Bhut Jolokia , etc . ) with a whopping 1,001,304 Scoville Heat Units according to the New Mexico State University Chile Pepper Institute . In February 2007 , Guinness World Records certified the Bhut Jolokia ( aka Naga Jolokia ) as the hottest pepper in the world . It is reportedly called the `` Ghost Pepper '' because after one bite of the pepper you `` give up the ghost '' .Now Dave 's Gourmet has made a sauce from this serious pepper . This is nothing to fool around with , it will cause pain , a lot of pain . So why would anybody want a sauce that hot ( other than for bravado ) ? I for one like the taste . It is a little smokier that Habanero . I also use it in sauces where I want heat but not the red color of chili peppers , such as a cream based sauce . Since it only takes a drop to give me the heat that I want it will hardly change the color of a white sauce.My only reservations about it is that it contains hot pepper extract ( which is what they call the stuff that they spray in the eyes of criminals ) . I 've seen hot pepper extract for sale as a commercial additive . It 's low on flavor but big on heat . Was this added to give the sauce extra pain inducing heat while using fewer actual Jolokia peppers ? I do n't know but it makes you think . Dave also has a special edition sauce that uses the Bhut Jolokia pepper and cost about four times more than this one does . I like this sauce , but use with caution .	1

First , the bad parts : the canister is awkward . If you want some sprinkles of any item , sure this is fine , but if you are trying to get a teaspoonful of any one item offered for a recipe , expect to spend five minutes getting the proper amount.But this Six-Shaker does what it does very well , which is offer a lot of differing heat levels and flavors ( raw to smokey ) in one easy to transport canister . I take mine with me everywhere.Value ? Well , it is a little steep for the couple spoonfuls of peppers in each chamber , but what you are paying for here is the round-robin with lots of selection in one device , not totting six different jars.Dave 's Gourmet products are always high quality on the ingredients/flavor side of things , and this product is no exception . These are high-quality peppers ( hint : want to know how to tell bad quality dried peppers ? Well , they taste increasingly gritty and/or dusty because guess what ? The sellers are extending the product with dust ! ) .If you have one favorite dried powdered pepper though ( say , chipolte flakes ) , then this is n't for you . You will use up your favorite long before the others are used and be stuck with orphan peppers for a long time . Me , I like variety.So if you like variety , hot peppers , and easy to transport this is a great assortment .	1
There are 6 different `` ready to shake on your food '' here ! ( Different peppers do taste `` didfferent '' too ! ) No `` grinding , chopping '' needed at all !	1
Love this little guy ! ! Gave it to my husband as a gift . He is the chef and he loved the fact that all the spices were in one nice container ! Yummy too !	1
This is a great sampler of chilies ! I purchased them as a stocking stuffer for my husband that loves spicy foods . We have used them a lot in various types of cooking . A little goes a long way , so it is a good value . I highly recommend for those who enjoy spicy food .	1
Perfect for chili heads , nothing in it very spicy but the variety is unique -- 6 chilis to taste test in one package . Very inexpensive and unique gift idea .	1
I have been experimenting with different flavors using spices and herbs and other condiments . I have n't had a lot of experience with different chili peppers so this was a great way to sample the chilies in a variety of forms . I 'd recommend it as a gift for novice cooks who like their food with varying degrees of heat .	1
I prepare these baked potatoes in a toaster oven . They are the perfect compliment to a hamburger , steak or chicken entree . Try them . You 'll like them !	1
These potatoes are pretty good . They can be eaten alone or served with a meal . Really like potatoes and this is an easy choice .	1
I really like this product . It tasted great and only took a few minutes to make in the microwave .	1
I will be buying this product again . I used it for pancakes and sausage . Was like heaven for me . Dipped my sausages : )	1
Joseph 's Sugar Free Maple Flavor Syrup is pretty good stuff for putting on Italian cakes or rolls . Sometimes I eat this at night and develop the worst form of gas anywhere . I ca n't help myself and have to let it `` out '' constantly , I do n't know if something is in here that makes me act up . I was ejected from a concert hall after my stomach could n't help itself . Just a warning to diabetics or regular sugar eaters , do n't try to swallow the whole bottle in one sitting .	1
You would never know that this syrup is sugar free . It has a nice thick consistency and very good taste .	1
This is , by FAR , the best sugarfree syrup I 've ever tried and I 've tried them ALL , I think ! In fact it might be the best syrup , bar none , apart from pure maple syrup . If you 're doing low-carb , or diabetic , or just try to avoid sugar in general , this product is excellent . Others I 've tried have been either sickeningly sweet , artificial-tasting , gloppy , or too thin . This is thick , luscious , and delicious ! The ONE caveat is that it IS , as another reviewer has pointed out , a sugar alcohol ( maltitol ) and if used in too great a quantity may well cause `` gastrointestinal distress '' to put it nicely ! I never have a problem with it when I stick to the recommended serving size of 1/4 cup - which does n't SOUND like much but is very adequate for a serving of pancakes or waffles ( low-carb for me please ! ) or added to recipes such as barbecue sauce or others requiring maple syrup . I even use it to make a delicious pecan pie !	1
Both a great tasting pancake syrup and highly effective laxative ! It must be the mallitol but every time I have this I have to go . If you like pancakes and farting this is the stuff you want . I did n't get cramps or pain , just gas and lots of poop . If you want less farts and less pooping then mix it with Vermont Sugar Free syrup which is made with splenda . I do 2 parts Vermont sugar free maple syrup to one part of this and it tastes even better . Vermonts is not that good by itself so it fixes that problem too .	1
`` Joseph 's Original Sugar Free Maple Flavor Syrup '' is really very good tasting syrup . Being diabetic I have to watch all sugar and carbs , so was pleased to find the highly rated Joseph 's sugar free syrup . The syrup has 0 net carbs , being sweetend with Maltitol . The flavor is as good , or better , as many `` regular '' maple flavored syrups on the market.Highly Recommended !	1
My diabetic brother STRONGLY recommended this to me . I am not diabetic , but I watch my carbs . I had tried other sugar-free syrups , and they all disappointed me , and I had given up on carb-free syrup ( and , thus , on all syrup , because I wo n't eat that sugary stuff ) . But , on the urging of my brother , I decided to try once more.This syrup is AMAZING . It tastes exactly like the sugary stuff the kids eat . The consistency is a little bit thinner , but the taste is exactly the same . Even my kids ca n't tell the difference .	1
I love maple syrup but not the calories . So I stumbled by accident onto this amazing syrup that I love ! My diabetic friends will all get a lifetime supply of this stuff !	1
The cap is quite simple , no flip top for easy application , which is fine when you first remove the safety seal . This product needs to be refrigerated after opening which makes pouring a pain . Instead of a small ribbon that would typically come out of a squeeze syrup bottle , you have an enormous 1 & # 34 ; diameter ROPE that you must cut off and clean up before replacing the cap . Packaging certainly needs fixing but the syrup is most delicious !	1
I have tried several sugar free syrups ( even Cracker Barrel 's ) and light syrups ( Mrs. Butterworth 's Light , Aunt Jemima Light ) without much success . They were all thin/watery with weak flavor compared to regular syrup , and not low enough in calories to make the switch worth it . I spotted this syrup in a Whole Foods store . I hesitated to try it because it was very expensive , but I was desperate . I paid $ 7.99 for a small bottle . After tasting it , I would not hesitate to pay even more ! This is hands down the best sugar-free syrup I have ever had . It is thick , with a good flavor , and only 35 calories per serving . And , the serving size is the same as regular syrup ( 1 ounce , or about 1/4 cup ) .I bought this syrup to help me lose weight and eat healthier . I have not encountered any of the side effects others have mentioned over the maltitol , but I also use this in moderation - pancakes and french toast are not exactly low-cal on their own ! This is still a very expensive product , but worth the cost for the quality . I do n't think I would use it as an alternative sweetener as suggested on the bottle ; not with Splenda available , and significantly cheaper . Highly recommended !	1
I have tried pretty much all the available brands of sugar free breakfast syrup . Joseph 's is BY FAR the best I 've ever come across . The flavor is indistinguishable from full sugar syrups and the texture is thick and rich . You do have to be careful . The syrup is so good and so low in calories , that it 's easy to get carried away and as another reviewer reminded us , this product does contain Malitol , which has a pronounced laxative effect if too much is consumed in one setting .	1
This is like the real thing . I do n't use much so have n't had any digestive problems with it . Goes very well with low-carb pancakes especially with good butter .	1
This is the best tasting sugar free maple syrup I 've tried . You will never know this is sugar free . I love it on my pancakes with an egg on top !	1
This is the best sugar-free maple flavored syrup I 've found so far . I 've tried 4 different brands before this . I read the reviews and decided to give it a shot ; although the price is too high here on Amazon . I 've found it 4 bucks cheaper elsewhere ( although shipping is then added in and here on Amazon I use Prime - which I 'm finding to be a bit too costly as well ) . The syrup however ; is excellent . I 'll buy it elsewhere .	1
This really is the best sugar-free maple syrup I 've found . The ones with sucralose have a weird chemical taste , besides being unhealthy . Maltitol , a sugar alcohol , is the sweetener used in this product . My boys and husband love the maple flavor of this syrup !	1
Most sugar free syrup has a good maple taste and smell , but they are thin and watery . This syrup is very thick and tastes every bit as good as any regular maple syrup found in the supermarket .	1
Very good product . I ca n't tell the difference from regular syrup . Excellent product , will ; definitely purchase again and has a great value	1
We love this coffee , it 's all about the chicory which adds great flavor making this a rich tasting cup of coffee .	1
I loved this particular coffee product . I gave to my nephew as a Christmas present as he just loves coffee .	1
If you like pre-ground coffee , this is a good one . However , I switched back to my whole beans . Like the flavor better , when I grind my own beans .	1
It 's summer . It 's so muggy you can see the steam rise off the pavement . Yep , you 're in the semi-tropics now . It 's New Orleans and the living is easy . And it is 8 o'clock in the morning . Time for cafe au lait made with coffee and chicory and a plate of beignets dusted with powdered sugar . It 's the chicory that gives cafe au lait its robust , mellowed down flavor.Chicory ? What is chicory ? Thought you would never ask . I just happen to have that answer right here : From Wikipedia : `` Root chicory ( Cichorium intybus var . sativum ) has been in cultivation in Europe as a coffee substitute . The roots are baked , ground , and used as a coffee substitute and additive , especially in the Mediterranean region ( where the plant is native ) , although its use as a coffee additive is also very popular in India , parts of Southeast Asia and the American South , particularly in New Orleans . Chicory , with sugar beet and rye was used as an ingredient of the East German Mischkaffee ( mixed coffee ) , introduced during the `` coffee crisis '' of 1976-9 . '' Chicory is also related to endive and raddichio.Cafe au lait is strong coffee mixed half with hot milk , and sugar added as desired . There is nothing like it , especially when drunk in the atmosphere of New Orleans .	1
Chicory gives this coffee its rich taste , dark color and syrupy body -- I guess , although no other chicory-cut coffee I 've ever tasted was this good . Although this coffee tastes very strong and robust , I suspect it has less caffeine than the straight stuff ; at least , I 've been able to drink a lot of it without getting the jitters.I usually buy mine for some ridiculously low price at an Asian market , but lately they 've been out of stock . Anyone know why Asian markets carry this product ? I wonder if there 's an interesting story behind that ...	1
On a sultry July morning , a few years before Katrina blew into town , a friend and I wandered into the frenetic , powder-sugar dusted Cafe du Monde for an early cup of coffee and the famously fabulous fritters we had heard so much about . We were hot , sweaty , and more than a little worn out from having hoofed all over the historic district . It would take more than a few Dunkin Donuts to revive our exausted , jaded spirits and a whole lot more than a Krispee Kream to skewer our skepticism.The pastries needed to be fresh , hot , and Paris-pretty to impress us . The coffee had to be perfectly percolated to perk us up.What we had that morning ( several plates of steaming , sinfully-sweet , precisely-powdered beignets ) were tiny pillows of pastry perfection . The beignets were so good , we made several more early morning trips to Cafe du Monde during our stay in New Orleans . The coffee was utterly addictive , strong , lovely , full-bodied , with a rich aroma that could be detected long before we entered the shop.Once home , I experienced a serious post-perfect-beignet let-down . Krispee Kream no longer cut it . Starbucks was sadly unsatisfying.I was thrilled when I discovered I could buy Cafe du Monde 's beignet mix and coffeee online . I ordered several boxes and cans , stocked up on a truck-load of powdered sugar , and anxiously waited by my mailbox . When the much-coveted beignet mix was finally delivered , I wasted no time in firing up the oil and brewing a pot of coffee.I was very pleased with the beignet mix and the chicory coffee . The directions were easy to follow ( just add water ) and the amount of mix in the box was generous for the price . Once properlly prepared , the beignets were just as delicious as those served at Cafe du Monde ( of course , you do have that tiresome clean-up when you make them at home that you do n't have when you go to the cafe in New Orleans , but all truly great things come with a price ) .Pefect patries and heavenly coffee . Forget Starbucks !	1
Note that this is a very coarse grind , so do not try brewing it in a paper filter type maker , and definitely not in Keurig or espresso type makers . The grind is all wrong for those . Use with a French press or a percolator ( I use aFarberware Classic Stainless Steel Percolatorspecifically for this coffee.Because the chicory in this blend is fairly prominent , I usually make my coffee au lait style . Actually , I make it more like cafe Cubano with scalded or steamed milk , but that is a personal preference . If you have never tried a chicory blended coffee you may want to at least use a little cream or milk and a touch of sugar , even if you normally take your coffee black . Once you grow accustomed to the chicory you can cut back on the additives until you can enjoy it straight up . I 'll forewarn you , though , that once you develop a taste for this you will get cravings at the oddest times.Chicory in coffee was practically the de facto blend when I was growing up in Virginia . It 's a traditional flavor throughout the south and especially New Orleans . I do not often drink this coffee , but when I have a craving this is the only brand that I trust.If you are from New Orleans I am guessing that you associate this with beignets . I prefer mine with a palmier or one of my favorites , Stella D'oro Original Breakfast Treats .	1
This is a much better Coffee than the French Market brand sole in our local grocery stores as chicory Coffee . It tastes like a higher quality Coffee and it 's just so much better once you try this brand of Louisiana coffee you 'll never touch French Market again . This is a mellow , smooth yet strong Coffee with a pleasant after taste that you will enjoy how it lingers after you 're finished with your last cup for the morning . French Market ( it 's only competitor ) is bitter , too strong , the last cup in the pot is almost undrinkable , and you need to wash your mouth out with something with something that will get the bitterness out of your mouth it 's so bad . I 've on occasion used peppermint tea after one or two cups of French Market.Not with Caf & eacute ; Du Monde , I can sit and drink an entire pot of this delicious Coffee and I love the lingering aftertaste . Weather with a typical breakfast , Donuts , Cereal or just plain toast this Coffee compliments the flavor of everything you eat . Just having it alone is like a treat ! If you have been drinking French Market please try this brand and find out what you have been missing !	1
Sans Sucre `` Mousse Mix - Chocolate Cheesecake '' is a fantastic diet dessert . Being a diabetic I am always looking for good tasting , low carb food and this dessert is high on my list.The texture is very good and the flavor is not `` diet '' at all.Highly Recommended !	1
Great sugar free treat , decent taste and makes a nice portion to share . I 'd recommend to anyone on Atkins Maintenance or needing sugar free treats .	1
You can tell it 's artificially sweetened but if you 're not allowed to have sugar , it sure is a treat . I liked it and will reorder it .	1
if you put it in the freezer and let it freeze it is like eating two cups of chocolate candy . i wonder how many calories there are in two cups of chocolate candy .	1
I was on a low carb diet , and thought I found heaven when I tried the chocolate cheesecake mousse by Sans Sucre . I used half cream , half water to keep the carbs down , and it would whip up much faster than using skim milk . I do have a problem with the product since I had gastric bypass surgery -- the whipped air in the mousse actually hurts my small stomach ( air is n't a bariatric surgery patient 's friend ) . I 'm hoping I 'll be able to eat this once again after my stomach has time to heal and adjust . Keeping my fingers crossed , because this stuff is delicious .	1
I tried this because it is diabetes friendly . It makes up smooth & creamy in just a few minutes . The chocolate taste is not strong . The serving size is too small for me to be satisfied ( but , since I am not counting calories and Splenda replaces the sugar , serving size was not important to me . I do better with a large serving or 2 to satisfy my yearning , then no dessert for the rest of the week instead of a little , unsatisfactory amount every day for a week : ) . Also , I noticed an & # 34 ; off & # 34 ; flavor -- you know it is & # 34 ; diet & # 34 ; . Even so , I would buy it again when I 'm in the mood for mousse , but I prefer my homemade , diabetes friendly ice cream . Compared to what was on the market 10-15 years ago , this is very yummy .	1
I adore the plain chocolate Sans Sucre but this is awesome , too . Slightly less intense chocolate flavor , but feels denser and more creamy . I love both !	1
Product description says `` Mousse Mixes that are smooth , rich , creamy and sugar-free ! '' There are actually 4g of sugar per serving . This package contains 2 envelopes and each envelope supposedly has 4 servings . So if you eat one package , that 's 16g of sugar that you 're consuming.Here are the nutrition facts from the box : Total Fat 1.5gSaturated Fat 1gTrans Fat 0g -- but how does that add up to 1.5g of total fat ? ? If you read the ingredients , this contains hydrogenated palm kernel oil , which is basically trans fat ... Total Carbohydrate 8gDietary Fiber 0gProtein 3gJudging by the taste alone , this is awesome -- smooth , rich & creamy -- and I did n't even use a hand mixer to whip this up ! It was a snap to make and enjoy after 2 hours of chilling . If I was n't watching my sugar or carb intake , then I would gobble this up in a heartbeat . If you stick to the 1/2 cup serving recommendation , then you 're consuming LOWER sugar/carb but 1/2 cup ? ? C'mon ...	1
I very much like this salsa verde , in both the standard and mild forms . It I feel is great on almost any Mexican dish , I like using it as a salsa for tortilla chips when I do n't want to use a red or chipolte based one for instance . Flavor is a bit `` tangy '' without being too strong in that way . And the normal is n't all that hot I feel.Check your local grocery store before buying from here . Two of my local ones in the Mexican/Hispanic food section carry this and one or two other Herdez brand salsas most of the time . ( Although they usually do n't have the mild , just the normal salsa verde ) . The reason I suggest that is so people can save on shipping . But if not , then yes order a jar and give this a go , it 's a nice salsa . ( And to comment on the obvious troll that posted that this tastes like butt cream in another so called review ... .how exactly do you know that ... )	1
And you can because its that mild.I 'm a chilihead from way back , and a friend of mine turned me onto this stuff so I picked it up and made some Chili Verde . One bite and I was completely hooked . It was n't what I expected , I knew the serranos were n't going to blow my socks off , but they are barely noticeable . But that sweet and tangy tomatillo and garlic flavor is just right for flavoring dishes like this , or just eating with chips , nobody will complain about the heat ... its not there . Also wonderful on homemade fish tacos.You may have to search high and low for this locally , I have one store that carries it and they are always sold out , so buy an extra jar if its available .	1
This is spicy without being overly hot . The family absolutely loves the flavor and I ca n't keep it in the pantry .	1
Not too hot , but hot enough ( unless you are the type to put hot sauce on everything ) . It has a great citrusy tang to it . excellent with chips , as a taco topping etc .	1
First off - this is not an `` instant ' product the way most americans expect Hot Cocoa products to be . It comes in cakes and must be ground either with a mortar & pestle or in a very sturdy grinder/blender . It is a basic recipe which suits the majority . Therefore , if you want it to be super spicy , you need to dress it up a bit . Follow the package instructions for best results but use a whisk . It needs to be made in a saucepan on top of the stove or in a Mr. Coffee Cocomotion machine.Grind the cakes in advance for maximum convenience and use 1 and a half times the recommended amount for best results . Use whole milk for best results or 2 % . Skim milk just does n't work as well . For a spicier mug of cocoa , add ground chili powder to taste . You can also add a piece of vanilla bean while cooking if you like that . If you want even more cinnamon taste , you can cook with a cinnamon stick . You can add espresso powder as well for a nice change of pace . Instant coffee will do in a pinch plus that 's a good way to get rid of intsant coffee ! It 's best to try a few mugs of Ibarra before you decide to spice it up . The flavor will grow on you . If you do n't feel like paying the shipping fees , ask your grocer if they carry this item . Most chain grocery stores with a Hispanic section do carry Ibarra .	1
This stuff is the BOMB ! Dark , Gritty , Sweet , with a bite of cinnamon ! We doan need no stinking Hershey 's ! ! ! Makes great hot chocolate , great mole , or just savor it by itself as actual `` Chocolate Para Mesa . `` My mole recipe : 1/2 cup flour or corn starch , 1/2 cup cooking oil , 1 Ibarra disc , 1/4 cup minced garlic , 2 Tbsp onion powder , 1 Tbsp cumin powder , 2 Tbsp Chili powder , 1 Tbsp salt , 1/4 cup tequila , 1/2 cup Amontillado ( or 1/3 cup merlot and 2 Tbsp brandy ) . Make rue out of flour and oil , add garlic and spices , stir until blended smoothly . Separately melt/dissolve disc in tequila and wine over moderate heat ( do not burn ! ) . Combine chocolate/alcohol mix with spiced rue and allow to slowly cook down to desired consistency and thickness . Serve over meat and rice .	1
Could n't wait to try this product . Loved the fact I tried it . Easy to make , creamy texture , rich chocolate taste .	1
I too had the pleasure to taste the real deal in Mexico . I loved it . when I came home I sought out the real deal here in the states , I guess I did not look very far but I did come up with this pretty good substitute . I also like nestles brand Mexican chocolate , I tried them side by side and they are almost exactly the same.I love the texture and I often , more than not , eat it just the way it is right from the bar . But to make a good Mexican cocoa you need to use a paddle and put the chocolate in the cup , pour over the hot milk and paddle it till it is melted and foamy . You do not need to microwave it , yuck ! You do not have to put it in the blender , Mexican people , for the most part , do not use blenders for their hot cocoa . I buy it is the store it is too expensive here .	1
From Nestle comes Abuelita an excellent hot chocolate for those Fall and Wintry days . This is sugared dark chocolate with a hint of cinnamon . Each box comes with six tablets . The best way to serve is to heat four cups of milk , break up one tablet , put milk and chocolate in blender , and blend approximately one minute . I have the standard powdered hot chocolate in the cupboard but my kids seem to go for the Abuelita first . They add one broken tablet and milk into the Cocomotion and in a few minutes they are in hot chocolate heaven . Abuelita has a homemade dark chocolate taste that is not found in most conventional powdered brands . This a product that is well worth keeping on hand for those hot chocolate days .	1
I love this hot chocolate ! this is just a great drink -- the first couple times I made it I did n't do it correctly and it did n't so good -- You have to nuke the bar of chocolate for 30 seconds in microwave - and you have to put in blender -- so all ingredients blend -- if you do n't you will have a chalky and that would be sad -- what I have learned is put chocolate in microwave -- put your milk in sauce pan and warm it up -- add chocolate and stir -- when the chocolate melts put into a blender or I use immersion blender to get all spices blended -- yeah and then you have the best hot chocolate in the world -- how can you go wrong with big beautiful piece of chocolate ? all other hot chocolate drinks are kind of boring compared to this --	1
Real Mexican chocolate of any version will be much better than mass produced American chocolate simply because the cocoa content is much higher ( as w/ European chocolate ) . This is REAL dark chocolate w/ a little spice and sugar . I do not think it requires any additional sugar when I make it since I want the dark chocolate flavor . I use a whisk and it comes out delicious . I think this is one of the best products Nestle makes and about the only one I consistently purchase . In fact I 'm going to try the powder mix version for convenience , but since the chocolate will be further processed , it probably wo n't be as good . However , it also received positive reviews .	1
This is a really delicious chocolate . I made it with part milk and part half and half ( and a little less milk than the package directs ) . It is a little grittier than the usual chocolate , but it is very good and worth it . I usually use Bellagio , but this is a great switch when you want a not so sweet but still rich drink .	1
I had the pleasure to taste the real deal in Mexico . I loved it .

I tried this first at an authentic Mexican restaurant we used to frequent . Just a few drops here and there on a dish would make the flavor really pop . Now we keep it on hand at home and use it on all kinds of things . I put it in chili , mix it into mayo for a zesty sandwich spread , use it liberally when I 'm in the mood to have my eyeballs fall out , etc . Now that I 've had this sauce , nothing else will do !	1
I love this El Yucateco Green Chile sauce . It 's got a little heat and a lot of flavor . This and Valentina are my two favorite Mexican sauces . They 're big on flavor . I love this sauce on tacos . The prices here are ridiculous . This sauce should come in at under $ 2 for the 4 oz bottle .	1
I use this on Mexican dishes , rice , beans , etc . I am a huge fan of Habanero sauces and this green sauce takes the cake . I have n't found anything similar in quality or spiciness . Highly recommend if it if you enjoy a nice hot green sauce .	1
I love to spice up my food whether it is chili , soup , Mexican food , or some type of meat or barbeque . This El Yucateco Green Chile Habanero Sauce is wonderful if you like HOT SPICY SAUCE ! This is one of the great hot sauces that does n't taste like vinegar.This is a great sauce to use as an additive in other sauces or barbeque sauces to add zest to them . You can control the dose to get the right flavor . Sometimes a mixture of two or three sauces comes up with the right combination for a perfect barbeque basting sauce.I included a photo of the nutrition label for your information . This is a great hot sauce and one of my favorites . If you like spicy food then you will love this one ! Easy does it or you will be saying ouch !	1
This sauce is definitely hot , but it has so much flavor , and the taste is so much brighter than other , more vinegary hot sauces . It 's great on anything fresh and you just ca n't beat it on anything with avocado .	1
I first had this at a local Mexican restaurant and went crazy for it , even though I thought I might die of the heat . I am a huge , yet disciminating , fan of hot suaces in general but this is by far my favorite right now . I can handle a lot of heat as a regular hot sauce eater but this stuff is on a different scale than what you can get at the grocery store . My husband wo n't come near this stuff . It is so good I want to pour it on whatever I 'm eating but it is sooooo hot I have to find that threshold of barely tolerable heat before it 's so much I ca n't take it . Of course , with continued dosage I can do more over time . Our Publix and Kroger does n't carry it so I have to go to the mercado/taqueria and can only get the 4 oz . version so this time I actually bought three 8 oz . bottles here on Amazon ( fiendish , I know ) .The flavor is excellent , uncomplicated and straight forward like fresh green habaneros blended with a bit of salt and a bit of vinegar . It is n't thin or overly vinegary or too salty though like a lot of hot sauces . I think this is because there is more actual habaneros in there because it 's a little thicker consistency with a bit of fine texture to it . Also , the color is fabulous . I do n't know if they add food dye or not but it is this vibrant , almost neon grass green . Love it.My favorite way to eat it is on simple things like carne asada with flour tortillas , avocado and shredded lettuce , on 'over medium ' fried eggs , and it 's perfect on fish tacos with cool slaw , raw white onion and ranch . The Mexican restaurant where I first had this does n't have it on the tables anymore ( probably because it 's too hot for most ) but they take it and puree it fine with avocado for this outrageously hot guacamole/habanero sauce thing that is just awesome.So obviously I love it and highly recommend it for experienced hot sauce people .	1
If you like a drop of heat on your food , this is the product for you !	1
Love it ! It has tang , a lot of heat , pepper , bite , and goes with everything . Good price too .	1
I 'm torn about this sauce . Its blazing hot , but I 'm not crazy about the flavor and so farI have n't found anything this pairs too well with.For pouring straight on ... .no bueno . As an additive to barbecue sauce or other dishesthat dilute this down to a proper heat level , it works pretty good . I gave it 4 stars causeyou find this locally anywhere at the superstore , and its cheap . I use it in Bloody Marys , its better than Tabasco for that purpose .	1
Love this product , super spicy , can be add to anything , including salsa and chip , divine ! ! ! Fast delivery .	1
Hot and very flexible in use . Put it on chicken , Mexican and chili . Add it to regular taco sauce for some extra blast . Do n't bother with it if you do n't like hot hot sauce .	1
Sure , most hot sauces are HOT . This one is no different - it 'll heat up your eggs , rice , or whatever else very quickly . I only rate it four stars because usually I like some flavor to go with the heat . This lacked flavor , but if you want sheer hot sauce , this will do .	1
It gets 5 stars just for the no vinegar part..I like tabasco but I do not love any hot sauce loaded with distilled vinegar , this is fabulous because I get to really taste habanero and no vinegar . I love habaneros they might not be the worlds hottest chili but oh the flavor , If you add this to some roasted salsa ( put habs in that for sure ) but add some of this if you did n't have any and it would be great . My only gripe is coloring added I know its food coloring but still it did n't really need it .	1
This is liquid fire ! It 's really tasty too . But , only use a drop !	1
This New England winter is brutal . The winds keep howling , the temps keep dropping and the snow is pounding us like we owe the clouds money . Every day I 'm bundling up and shoveling four feet of something -- snow , ice , stranded hybrids , Kennedys -- and I 'm done with it . I just wanted to find some way to warm up.Also , to feel my toes again and have my [ ... ] crawl back out of my rib cage . But I settled for trying to warm up.I 've always heard that if you warm up on the inside , then the outside will follow . So I bought this bottle of El Yucateco and saved it for the next inevitable snowstorm . When I was done shoveling and still shivering , I opened it up and slammed it down the hatch -- all eight ounces.First , a few words about the taste : El Yucateco red has a nice tangy element , lingering through the forward habanero kick and beyond . The additional spices play well with the primary pepper , adding a savory depth that 's more than just pure heat or capsaicin jolt . The tomato base and hearty thick texture promise a richness and complexity of flavor that is delivered quite nicely to the palate.And now , a few words about the unrelenting napalm burn that traveled around my mouth , down my gullet and -- over the next twelve hours or so -- into , through , and out my intestines , scorching and defiling every square millimeter of delicate insides that it touched : [ ... ] Overall , I 'd say this would make a very nice complement to a variety of Mexican or South American dishes , as well as grilled meats , starchy vegetables or as an extra kick to , say , garlicky green veggie side dishes . Also , it 's unlikely that I 'll be able to sit down without searing pain for at least a month . So 'use in moderation ' is the take-home message , I suppose .	1
i think this sauce has some kind of addicting drugs in it , cause i can not stop eating this ! LOL : - ) it 's better then any chipottle sauce i have ever tasted.i love hot spicy food and i have tried ALL hot sauces in the world lolbut this stuff is really amazing ! its NOT very `` Hot '' , but it is does have a mid-heat to it . the richness and the smokyness , with the sweet undertones of this sauce is so good ! its NOT an `` all in one '' sauce because it does have a Bold taste to it , so i would say that it can not be mixed with `` EVERYTHING '' cause its not one of those `` plain '' hot sauces that can be added to anything.this is a semi thick rich smoky hot and spicy sauce that i would die for ( its really that good ! ) i would use this on allmost anything thats fried and needs a dip or hamburgers etc ... .think about it as a spicy BBQ sauce ... ... .but the BEST bbq sauce in the world ! i also us it as a replacement for anywhere ketchup is needed.you guys really must try this : - )	1
I have used El Yucateco Habanero ( red ) sauce for years , and I love it . Mainly becauseits hot as Hell , and the company makes no apologies for that.This stuff has a mild smokey flavor , without the bite that its big brother has . You canjust pour this directly on chips , in salsa , soups , etc . Its very very good , and muchbetter than Tabasco Chipotle or any other widely available sauce. $ 2.99 is a great price . Thats what I pay for it locally , but I had to search it out .	1
This stuff is great ! It 's not too hot . Heck , even Frank 's Red Hot hot sauce is hotter . But this stuff has such a great flavor . You 'll put it on burritos , scrambled eggs , your cereal ... you name it !	1
Everyone needs a hobby . I 've been blind taste testing hot sauces for over 6 months . I have about 40 hot sauces in my house . I taste test them raw , and then with food ; write up some notes and then a week or so later do the same thing again and then compare all my notes . I repeat this process again and again . Like I said : everyone needs a hobby . Frankly I wanted to settle on a few excellent brands because I love hot foods . So for about $ 75.00 I have a cabinet filled with hot sauces.The first thing that everyone needs to know is that a Chipotle based hot sauce is a sub-category within the hot sauce universe . The chipotle is a smoked jalape & ntilde ; o & ntilde ; o pepper , relatively mild and it has a rich , almost sweet flavor , and it is not that hot . I happen to love its taste but I have discovered there are a number of inferior sauces based on this pepper.The El Yucateco is at the very top of my list for this type of pepper . It has a rich smokey ( almost sweet ) flavor with some heat . Keep in mind , no chipotle based sauce has searing heat . This blend includes some sugar and even a bit of tomato . It 's only competitor , according to my taste testing , would be Tabasco 's Chipotle based sauce which is also excellent . Tabasco adds primarily vinegar to its blend while , as noted , El Yucateco adds sugar and tomato paste to theirs . Both seem a bit sweet and both have a low level of heat . Either one of these brands is vastly superior to all the other Chipotle sauces I have taste tested.When you can find this sauce in stores , the average price is about $ 2.00FOR A COUPLE OF BUCKS YOU SHOULD TRY THIS ONE but watch out for Amazon sellers that offer a low price per bottle combined with high shipping charges , even when you order many bottles at the same time.Watch out for Amazon sellers that offer a low price but then charge a very high shipping charge on A PER BOTTLE BASIS . In other words , even if you order 6 bottles at the same time - a very high shipping charge will apply - based on the single bottle shipping rate . One way a SELLER can game the Amazon system is to offer a low price but correspondingly high shipping charges on a per bottle basis . Buyer beware ! BEST BUY : El Yucateco Chipotle Hot Sauce , 5 FL OZ bottles ( pack of 12 ) is your best buy at $ 30.00 with free shipping . That is only $ 2.50 per bottle delivered !	1
This is by far the best chipotle hot sauce on the market . We first tried it at a Mexican restaurant , and luckily found it in the grocery store and at mexgrocer.com . I put in on fish tacos and in chili ... there 's a nice zing , it 's pretty smoky , not overly hot , but very very flavorful .	1
What this product needs is one of those jumbo 20-40 oz plastic ketchup-style squirt bottles . Whenever i throw a chili event , I haul out five or six various bottles of stuff . No matter what 's on the table , the yucateco gets drained and I 'm heartbroken.Its decently hot , but not overwhelming . Doesnt have that hideous acrid vinegar taste that most hot sauces have . Lots of flavor , works with everything , the only way to use it is to upend the little bottle and use a big gob . Basically , anywhere ketchup is good , yucateco is better . I go to wal mart for mine , buy four bottles at a time .	1
I always like to try new hot sauces , and I picked up a bottle of this `` El Yucateco Chipolte Hot Sauce '' at my local Mexican grocer . Like most human beings who like things that taste good , I love chipotle and use the flavor when I am cooking all the time.I was surprised at my first pour . This hot sauce was n't thick like most , but was runny and came pouring out of the bottle . I gave it a taste , and fell instantly in love . This little bottle has all the goodness of a can of chipotle in adobe sauce . It is strong , flavorful , and smoky . There is almost no heat -- at least not to me -- and I mixed it with a drop ofDave 's Insanity Sauceto give it a little bite . Even then , I could pour gallons of this onto my food.That is the danger , of course . Because this sauce is liquid-like , you can run through an entire bottle at a sitting . And because it tastes so good , you just might want to .	1
A little more heat than cayenne pepper sauces like Tabasco but nowhere near as hot as the hotter habanero sauces . It has a great flavor that goes well with a variety of foods , flavors salad dressing , sandwich spread and barbeque sauces and make the blandest dishes come to life . It ranks in the upper tier of my favorite sauces .	1
I got introduced to this hot sauce by someone who gave me a bottle ... this will definitely be something I buy once it 's gone . It 's a great staple as others have mentioned . I would certainly recommend it . Great flavor without too much heat . It 's just right !	1
I really like this sauce . It is a great blend ! While there is nothing truly remarkable about it - more importantly - it has no obvious flaws . It simply has a nicely balanced flavor and that alone is quite rare in hot sauces ! ! ! ! This sauce could or should be a staple in any kitchen . I 'm glad to have a bottle in my pantry.I would rate this sauce somewhere between mild and medium hot . You 'll need more than a couple of drops but not much more than that to generate some heat in any dish . Compared to Tabasco 's original you 'll need about twice the number of drops.Ingredients ( as copied from the label ) : Water , Red Peppers , Salt , Spices , Garlic , Acetic Acid ( a component of vinegar ) , etc ... ... Note the relatively low level of vinegar within the sauce . That is a good thing . The type of red pepper is unknown but there is a natural sweetness to this sauce which I find quite pleasant . That sweetness balances nicely against the heat . View this sauce as a superior alternative to a very common benchmark - the original Tabasco hot sauce.Minor flaws : There is a bit too much salt in this sauce but that only becomes evident when used in an already heavily salted dish . For example : This is not the best choice for a Bloody Mary due to the heavily salted nature of most vegetable/tomato juices.Since this sauce is available in 5 oz , 10 oz and 32 oz sizes - you 'd be wise to pick up the 32oz size given the fact that it often costs little more than the smaller sizes.This is a fine basic hot sauce with a natural sweetness to it . This sauce is worthy of being a staple in any kitchen . It is better than most . What it lacks is that rare sense of freshness and , as noted , there is also a bit too much salt .	1
For well over a year , I have been using different types of hot sauce on different types of food . Before I started doing this , I only ever remember using hot sauce on barbeque sandwiches . Even though I have tried numerous types of hot sauce during this period , Tapatio Salsa Picante Hot Sauce has set itself apart from the others and has become a favorite . When I was given a bottle of this hot sauce for the first time , as far as I remember , I was just expecting a typical hot sauce -- this is not typical hot sauce . It is hotter than the other hot sauces that I like , but it is not overpowering and does not have a searing heat -- more like a peppery heat . In addition , Tapatio Salsa Picante Hot Sauce has a pleasing , exceptional flavor . This is a hot sauce that I prefer to use only for special occasions . It is recommendable .	1
What a discovery . This is a natural fruit booster that is great on everything from applesto watermelon . Makes a great rib rub , for rimming a margarita , on fish , pork , corn onthe cob , veggie , and in a crab pot or with shrimp . Just an amazing chili lime flavor thatperks up just about anything you can imagine.This is a handy way to add spice where a hot sauce would n't work . A 1/10 on the heatscale , nobody is going to complain about this setting them on fire . Available just abouteverywhere at your local superstore for about $ 1.50 .	1
Warning : if you buy this , you will eat ALL the fruit you buy ALL at once . You will use fruit as a flavor vehicle for Tajin . This is the best , best , best . AMAZING on oranges , grapes , apples and , of course , watermelon .	1
Who knew someone had already combined these flavors I love ! ? ? Have sprinkled this on fruit ( mango and blueberry - yum ! ) , guacamole ( zippy ! ) and chicken and love what it does to each . Just zesty , not hot . Perfect !	1
First I used this great , traditional , Mexican , seasoning on Mango . Then it was cottage cheese . Then it was cucumbers ... and on , and on ... I 've become addicted to this . Chili is tasty and leaves a little after-burn , but still on the mild-ish side . You can taste the Lime and Salt , and that gives the tang . Really good !	1
Spicy and tart seasoning for fruit and vegetables , like sliced cucumbers and tomatoes . Tajin seasoning transforms avocados with an amazing burst of flavors . Delicious ! ! Tajin product arrived promptly and in perfect condition from this seller . I will order again , since I have not been able to find this product locally .	1
Tajin seasoning is really the favorite spice in my kitchen ! We put it on everything , from fruit to veggies to meats . It 's paticularly good on green beans . We also sprinkle it on fresh fruit -- so good ! Another way to use it to to make frozen juice bars ( mango is especially good ) and sprinkle them with tajin right before eating . You can also sprinkle some directly into the juice before freezing . This is a favorite treat at my house !	1
I 'm amazed that this seasoning has so many varied applications ! Do n't be afraid to sprinkle it on ice cream !	1
Lime and chile powder to sprinkle on popcorn , etc . Nice lime flavor , not too spicy , and nothing objectionable in the product .	1
Tajin is so yummy ! I 'm completely hooked but no one carries it in my area . When I found it on Amazon , I was overjoyed , only to find that it is no longer available . What gives ? I finally found it on Gourmet Sleuth and ordered enough to do me for awhile . Problem is , it wo n't be here for a few more days . : (	1
lime is really noticeabledo n't be afraid to use it in dishes instead of just as fruit and snack seasoning	1
Seriously the only corn flour you need for tortillas . We have tried a few different types but we keep coming back to Maseca . It was the one most of our friends used in Mexico .	1
This was a reccomendation by a friend of mine and she says it makes great soft Taco Shells ... ... .that from a Mexican Friend of hers ... ... ... ..so I ca n't wait to use this product .	1
I keep this in my gluten free pantry ! One time a friend made the nestle choc . chip cookies bars in a 9 x 13 pan with this instead of flour ( not knowing it was not flour ) and they actually turned out excellent ! I make them almost every weekend now for the kiddos or to take along to gatherings ! Gluten free !	1
Maseca Corn Flour , 4.4 lbs.is the real thing for making delicious tortillas . The only other ingredient necessary is water . Of course , a huge amount of technique is required ! My son-in-law uses it to thicken his wonderful chili . He gave me the recipe , which I placed in Flavored with Love : Mary Lou 's Family and Friends Can Cook . He 's such a nice son-in-law . He would not want me to tell you this , but he is a great cook.Maseca Corn Flour is made from ground , dried corn . It can be used to make masa harina ( dough ) for `` tortillas , sopes and empanadas , enchiladas , pupusas , guaraches , arepas and atole , '' the manufacturer says . It is gluten free.The manufacturer ( the Gruma ) company has been making this fine corn flour for over 50 years .	1
Looking for a cheaper gluten-free flour ? Look no further . They do n't mill wheat , so it 's gluten-free with no chance of cross-contamination -- unlike virtually every other brand of corn flour out there , except Publix , which is only available in four U.S. states.However , this is masa harina , not corn flour , so you can make tortillas , arepas , tamales and skillet corn bread with it ... and not much else.Edit : Masa Harina Socca ( With many thanks to Mark Bittman . ) One and 1/2 cup water to one cup masa harina -- let sit for several hours , covered . Preheat oven to 450 . Find a flat cast-iron skillet without sides -- like a flat fajita grill . ( A regular cast iron pan with sides will concentrate the heat too much on the edges and burn the edges before the center gets cooked . ) Pour enough canola oil into the pan that it sloshes a little . Spoon the dough into the pan . Finally , put the pan into the preheated oven . Leave for an hour to an hour and a half . Flip halfway through . L'Chaim .	1
If you 're cutting carbs or sugar but still want a nice treat this is a good choice . While there is a bit of an after taste there is no gastric distress after eating . Nice treat .	1
When you ca n't have much sugar in your diet but would like to have a bit of mousse now and then , this really meets the need . Easy to make in a hurry and just tasty enough to make up for not being allowed to eat deserts with real sugar in them .	1
I just made the Chocolate Mousse : very , very nice . Has a nice dark chocolate taste . Easy to make : combine powder and fat-free milk in your mixer , then chill . 70 calories per serviing of half a cup . Even has some fiber in it ! I do like dealing with eDiet shop . Very nice people and fast shipping .	1
I love chocolate . This satisfied my craving . It 's light and airy while filling . I would serve it to friend and family .	1
My Family and I like these Candy a lot , we have not bought them in a while , they are a bit expensive therefore they are for very special occasions .	1
50 odd years ago I sold this product as a high school fund raiser.The product is every bit as good although needless to say more expensive ... Well worth the money even today..I was so happy to find this product on Amazon .	1
My husband is from the UK , and these are not really unique or special there , but when we open the tin here , everyone is very interested because they are different . They are yummy , but kind of pricey for candies . Chocolate with different fruit centers and caramels .	1
How many times do we dream of a nice English chocolate after dinner ? Having a large tin of Quality Street fulfilled this dream many times over .	1
If you make jerky or BBQ sauce , ribs , etc. , this is essential for that fabulous , smokey flavor . Even the package smelled wonderful . If you buy this by the gallon you will think of many ways to upgrade the everyday recipes you use for meats & sauces . Kitchen smells wonderful . LOVE it .	1
Wright 's Liquid Smoke , Hickory , 1 gal.This is a great saver . I am a vegetarian , and this product seasons beans and soups . I use this gallon size because it saves me trips back and forth to the store . The flavor is very good .	1
I remember Wright 's Liquid Smoke from when I was a teenager . Now I find that it predates WWI and I have some old Wright 's brochures from about 1910 ( they carry no date , but quote 1906-1907 testimonials ) . The product is slightly different than the one I remember from years ago , perhaps because this product is no longer made by Wright's.That notwithstanding , the product performs well in actural use . It also has a reputation among amateur sausagemakers and bacon makers , as the best of the liquid smokes . I use mine in meat curing and sausagemaking . The only decent alternatives would be powdered smoke or a smokehouse .	1
Great value and taste . I use this for BBQ pork , which I make in bulk and freeze . I am so glad to have found this !	1
liquid goes right into making bbq smelling and tasting like great smoke hit it . i use gas grill and this aids in flavoring of the bbq . like good old days of smoking it .	1
My igourmet order was quick and easy , and arrived in good condition . While I prevaricated about spending this much for cheddars , I 'm glad I did . It was a nice treat for a special occasion -- -these are unusually flavorful and delightful , and each type has its own flavor notes . The important thing is to find recipes or uses that do n't in any way obscure the amazing flavors !	1
This cheese sampler is just great . Each block had a different taste . I was not disappointed in any of them . I was surprise to find out that I loved the Canadian cheese the best . I have never bought cheese from Canada but will do in the future .	1
Very impressed with the different cheese and how wonderful they tasted . I would order this and others as well . Thanks	1
This cheese made it to Afghanistan ! I love cheese and being deployed that 's one of the things I missed . I gave it a shot and order it and it arrived to me in perfect condition . Well packed and vaccumed sealed . Great taste ! ! !	1
If you love cheddar cheese , you will love this assortment from igourmet.com ... The cheese manages to be sharp yet sweet to my pallet ... For cheese lovers only ... An excellent gift ... 5 star rated ... .	1
I am usually not overly impressed with these samplers of specialty cheeses , but I do run a cross one now and again that simply stand out . This is one of them . I fully admit to being almost addicted to good cheddar so perhaps this is part of it . The quality of this cheese , even after being shipped all over the place and from heaven knows where , is absolutely excellent . My sweet friend Brenda sent me this one and it is going to take some hard work to figure out how to top her on this one . Secret for you : I plan to purchase one or two of these myself soon horde it away , and simply not share ! I do recommend you give this sampler a try ... you will be absolutely delighted .	1
I 'm not sure which I enjoy more : Smelling these beans after grinding or brewing them up to drink the coffee ! The price is a little high for me , but you get a decent amount ( 14oz ? ) and the quality of product is just insane . The only thing that rivals it this side of a true coffee shop , IMHO , is San Francisco Bay k-cups . I am very pleased with this product .	1
This coffee is smooth , but if you add more it can pack a punch without being bitter . I love the flavor - my absolute favorite . The price is reasonable compared to local stores ( got the 5-lb bag next time & it 's a great bargain ) . I 'll never buy coffee at Fresh Market or other specialty stores again ! What a great amazon choice to offer this coffee . Purchased 1 lb . and 5 lb . bags from amazon .	1
Rating the Hawaii Roasters 100 % Kona is a bit tricky - in a way it is like rating the acceleration of a Corvette or the comfort of Mercedes - it is supposes to be among the best ! . So with that - if this coffee was the same price asFolgers Coffee Ground Classic Roast Regular , 11.3-Ounce Packages ( Pack of 4 ) orMaxwell House French Roast ( Medium Dark ) Ground Coffee , 33-Ounce Jugs ( Pack of 2 ) it would rate as a easy 5 star product , but it is not the cost difference is significant . So with that it requires me to grade on a bit of a curve ... A bit on how I prepare the coffeeWater provided byFiltrete 3M Filtrete Water StationBurr GrinderCuisinart DBM-8 Supreme Grind Automatic Burr Mill ( CCM-16PC1 ) ( Medium burr ) Coffee makerBunn STX Specialty 10-Cup Home Coffee Brewer with Thermal CarafeWhat I like- A very , very smooth coffee - absolutely no trace of bitterness.- Very aromatic as you grind the beans- Other reviewers compared about the beans being a bit dry - mine were fresh- Nice medium roast - not overly bold ( This is a personal preference ) - The beans were not oily ( indicating over-roasting ) Other notes- Not a exotic flavor - it does not offer the range of flavors of a Kenyan or other African coffees ( which are usually cheaper ) . This is difficult to qualify , but other high-end coffees have a more distinguished flavor - the Sumatra 's are a bit bolder and almost smokey , Kenyan has a semi-sweet winey/oak flavor and so on ... I do n't notice any of these in the Kona.Final Verdict - A very good coffee , but it is pricey especially when compared to some of the African countries.4 Stars due to the price ( 5+ Stars compared to generic coffees )	1
I really look forward to Saturday mornings when I brew up a pot of great coffee and have time to sit and savor it . Weekdays what with getting the kids going we use Major Dickenson 's from Peet 's , but the weekends are different.Having family in Hawai'i we have learned about the pitfalls of buying `` Kona '' on the mainland ( heck even on Ohau ) . We have bought Kona `` blends '' that tasted like old Folgers . We have bought stale coffee that should have been tossed . We have bought over roasted beans that were little better than Starbucks French Roast.We have also bought Cromwell Estate peaberry ( roasat to order and simply amazing ) and until recently , we found that the best bang for the buck was the Costco Kona which you can only get on-island.When we ran out of the last batch of the Costco Kona , we took a gamble on this one and are really happy.Pros : - Medium roast is a real medium roast is highly consistent ( leading to a MUCH better cup ) - The coffee is truly fresh- The bean size is really consistent and there are no slubs ( again leading to a beter cup ) - The coffee has a complex flavor that develops over time with a lot of interesting secondary and tertiary flavors- Quality bag-to-bag is excellentCons : - If you like French Roast , this is NOT the coffee for you . French roasting burns out a lot of the flavinoids so you are better off with Starbucks of even Safeway.- at $ 30 a bag , it is not cheap and I really would like ot drink it every day.If you want a treat , give this a try .	1
I ordered this a week ago and actually find myself having cravings for it ; it 's a nice motivator to help me get up in the morning ! It 's a very smooth coffee and reminds me very much of the Kona coffees I had in Maui last year . I 'll definitely be buying again !	1
This is a very good flavor . I normally prefer a dark roast , however this coffee was very good ! Brings back the memories of the islands .	1
This is my first kona coffee and I love it . It 's rich and very satisfying . I 'm definitely staying with it .	1
I love Kona coffee by Blue Horse . Hawaii Roasters is a blend of beans from more than one estate where Blue Horse is coffee beans from a single estate . I guess I am kind of snobbish about the coffee I drink .	1
I have never purchased 30 dollar coffee before so this was kind of splurge for me and I usually drink coffee that comes in 12 ounce bags at about a 5 to 7 dollar range so I wondered how much difference could it really be in quality . I was looking for some good holiday food and I read all the reviews and decided to go ahead and try it out and to my surprise I really enjoyed it and believe me I was expecting quite a bit for 30 dollar coffee . The 1st thing I noticed was the aroma when I 1st broke into the package and it was n't the normal aroma I was used to when breaking into new coffee for the 1st time . The aroma was so much better and it was so much different and pleasing in smell that I knew it was going to be a great cup of coffee . With anticipation I ground up the beans and made my 1st pot and actually just finished it before this was wrote . I took my time drinking this coffee and I must say I have drank a lot of coffee in my time and thought I would n't be able to tell a difference but I found myself looking forward to my next cup . The taste was so fantastic and full of flavor that I really did n't expect it so I was really surprised by that . It was that good instead of with my normal coffee its usually just routine to drink it up even though its good its just not as good as this . If you are looking for some delicious coffee do yourself a favor pick this one up . If you are like me you might splurge every once in a while on food and even if you do it once you will find yourself missing this bag when its gone b/c I know I will . I still have about a whole package remaining and I think I will have to break down again later to get another . Though it is rather expensive I am very happy with this coffee .	1
Wonderfully areomatic and nice full flavor . A bit expensive , so I am on the fence about using this as our daily brew .	1
When I 'm in the mood for good coffee , I always turn to either 100 % Kona or 100 % Blue Mountain . Both are very expensive , so it 's kind of a treat to have them .But when I do , it 's spectacular . A smooth , even taste , that 's mellow and strong at the same time .	1
I used it to make French Press coffee . It tasted fresh , rich and full bodied . Far better than Columbian coffee . The reason for 4 stars is the price . It is very expensive . I prefer Lavazza super crema coffee beans which is much cheaper .	1
This coffee is spectacular and we keep it for guests mostly as real Kona is expensive . We used subscribe and save to get a better deal .	1
I have tried lots of different coffee brands this year , and this one , by far , is the best . Although I usually prefer a light roast , this medium roast is fantastic . There 's nothing like Hawaiian Kona . The price is still reasonable for Kona beans , and this brand really is exceptional.I drink it black , so it has to be good . There 's no attempt to hide the flavor of crappy beans by over-roasting . Or , even worse , adding `` flavorings '' to mask an inferior product.This coffee is very fine quality . Recommended .	1
This is my weekend coffee since I leave to catch the train too early to make a small pot . Smooth and rich , not bitter or burnt . This is the real deal .	1
Been using it for years - excellent product - only one I use	1
Yes this is very expensive but it does n't hurt me when I pay 20 bucks for a bottle . The extract will make or break your recipe . It does n't matter what brand of flour , butter , eggs , sugar you use but if the vanilla is cheap , it will ruin your creation or make it taste cheap . This is the best vanilla worth the price of saffron . It will taste like vanilla and will make your house smell like vanilla , no alcohol aftertaste . However , the price on Amazon varies so check your local prices before purchasing it . You might not even save anything if you just walk into Zabar 's or any baking store .	1
Nielsen-Massey Vanilla beans are hand-picked and the extract tastes like heaven . Try it and you will never purchase regular store-bought extract again . Apparently , a cold extraction process slowly draws the delicate flavor from the vanilla beans . Vanilla extract is made by macerating vanilla beans in a mixture of alcohol and water . When purchasing a bottle , avoid the artificial versions as they they tend to have a weaker , often tinny aftertaste . Splurge for the real stuff here ... .worth every penny. & # 34 ; Bourbon & # 34 ; gourmet beans , from Madagascar and the nearby islands , have the best reputation for quality and flavor ... and to my mind , after experimenting , this extract is the best - rich and creamy . The Mexican vanilla extract is stronger and it would be my 2nd choice . I buy this from Nielsen-Massey also.Nielsen-Massey vanillas has been in business for almost 100 years . They produce some of the finest vanilla extracts you can buy . The company offers a selection of Madagascar Bourbon , Tahitian & Mexican vanilla extracts and they are 100 % Organic . I have tried all three and prefer Bourbon & # 34 ; gourmet beans , from Madagascar , which have the best reputation for quality and flavor , but everyone has his/own preference . I was lucky , a friend gave me a mini gift pack of all three so I could taste the difference.This vanilla extract is gluten-free certified , kosher certified & allergen-free . Try it , you wo n't be sorry . Btw ... I also use a capful in my coffee sometimes . Beats regular , artificially flavored coffee any day .	1
I have always used good vanilla , never artificial . However , the first time I used Nielsen-Massey vanilla I could tell the difference . Your baked products willalso show the difference . It seems , only the best vanilla from the island of Madagascar is intense enough for Nielsen-Massey . it has long been the choice of bakers and ice-cream makers , this vanilla adds depth and flavor no other vanilla can match . It has a rich intensely flavored extract.I have also , purchased the vanilla beans which are whole 7 & # 34 ; pods , each equivalent to approximately 1 tablespoon of extract ; two pods per jar . Pure vanilla paste is convenient to use and infuses baked goods and ice cream with flavorful flecks of vanilla bean seeds.Highly Recommended . prisrob 06-17-13	1
This is a great vanilla and I always use it when I 'm baking something with more expensive ingredients or that I 'm serving to people . I do n't waste this on my smoothies , etc - for that , I use the medium priced vanilla .	1
After using Nielsen Massey 's Pure Vanilla Extract I would never be able to go back to using cheap artificial vanilla . There is just such a flavor difference . In fact friends ask me to put double the vanilla in my baked goods because they crave the flavor . I use this in banana bread , chocolate chip cookies , custards and ice cream . Basically anything that calls for vanilla is better with this more expensive brand . In fact , I do n't want to run out of it so I currently have four bottles . I guess I ca n't live without it.~The Rebecca Review	1
It has lots of specks of vanilla beans in here . The taste is wonderful . It is fabulous mixed in to plain yogurt .	1
I love to make homemade yogurt and ice cream . I have to remember that when I use vanilla past not to use the same amount as vanilla extract . This product is more concentrated and should be used in moderation for the same flavor . It is like using vanilla beans without the hassle of the bean . I love this stuff .	1
A true vanilla-holic I use this vanilla every day . I do n't even measure I just dump it in . Love the flavor , aroma , and bean flecks . I use it in place of vanilla extract all the time . This is a fantastic price for a great quantity . I will be purchasing this again as I 'm sure to run out at the speed I 'm using it . Its more of a syrup than a paste really , but it exchanges for extract beautifully . I usually just take out a bit of sugar from whatever I 'm using it in as the paste does contain sugar .	1
This is a great staple to have in the pantry , quality product.Would have given 5 stars but a little overpriced . Wont regret the purchase .	1
The paste is different than the extract . This is more like a syrup , full of tiny beans and ideal for vanilla ice cream or cream brulee	1
This product has been great . It has a great flavor , the bottle is huge and I would absolutely buy it again and would recommend this product to anyone else looking for a Vanilla Extract or Paste .	1
I first purchased a small 4 oz jar of Nielsen-Massey Vanilla Paste to try the product out . I thought it was such a great product that I bought it in the much bigger bottle . WELL WORT THE INVESTMENT . Keep in mind that a little goes a LONG way and you will end up wanting to put vanilla in everything you bake .	1
you cant beat the taste or the price for that matter on this Vanilla Bean Paste ... you use it as you would regular vanilla , teaspoon for teaspoon , however you get the beautiful little seeds as you get when you use a vanilla bean .	1
I 've tried a whole bunch of vanillas but none of them are as good as this one . The 32 ounce size is a money saver for anyone who uses a good deal of flavoring . Love the look of the seeds in this as well . Rich flavor and you do n't need to use a lot of it .	1
I add vanilla extract to everything ... my granola , cookies , cakes , ice creams ... it is so nice to get it in such a large quantity and save myself the $ $ and trips to the grocery store . This is the best vanilla extract I 've tried too , it is especially delicious in my vegan coconut milk ice cream ... the little flecks of vanilla are amazing . I recommend this product to anyone who uses a lot of vanilla !	1
This was recommended for all kinds of baking needs . It looks so super and we appreciate its availability through Amazon.com .	1
This is the best flavor for whipping cream ! ! You do see the specks of vanilla bean , but then you know it is the real thing .	1
This is my favorite vanilla for baking , by far ! ! ! I love that it is not a thin liquid but more of a thick , syrup consistency , so when added to anything you are baking ( especially in quantities that are over and above the quantity called for in a recipe , which is a must for me ) it does not alter the end product the way traditional thin vanilla extract does . In addition , like all Nielsen-Massey vanilla products , it has a robust vanilla flavor . Accept no cheap substitute . This is worth the price ; your taste buds will thank you .	1
I love this stuff . I use so much of this stuff I have to buy the 32 oz jug . It dissolves easier in fluid than just the powder . I also use their extract . Between these two products and my raw vanilla bean powder , I eat vanilla like it 's a food group.I 've had some other vanilla bean pastes . They were okay . This one 's the bomb .	1
This is a great price for this much vanilla bean paste and this brand is one of the best . I 'm thinking the average baker would never use this much paste but I bake several times a week and so this goes pretty quickly for me . I use it in place of vanilla extract but NOT when I want to keep an item really white like my fluffy buttercream icing ( I use a clear vanilla extract for that ) . I pretty much always double the amount of vanilla I put into a recipe because I love the flavor so much . The fun thing about vanilla bean paste is you get the attractive little black flecks like you would if you hand scraped a vanilla bean for your recipe . I use vanilla beans themselves too and I think the paste is just as good . You wo n't regret getting this . Great and delicious in poundcake ! Yum !	1
I only recently discovered vanilla bean paste . While it is not really a paste , it is thicker then regular vanilla extract , more like a syrup . The flavor is amazing . I love the little specks of vanilla bean that it adds to any recipe . Everything looks a little more special and homemade . This is now my vanilla of choice . The price is good too .	1
As I believe someone else had mentioned , I put vanilla on my vanilla ! This is my kind of vanilla . I even open it up sometimes just to smell it ! And it 's great in pies . We also make a vanilla fruit dip and it 's terrific ! I am just wondering how I am going to scrape the inside of the bottle to make sure I get every drop of it ! My husband even drizzled some over his vanilla ice cream . And I have put some in my hot vanilla chai . Like I said , I like vanilla on my vanilla ! I love that you can actually see the bean specs also . It 's definitely the best I have ever had !	1
I actually discovered vanilla paste in the smaller quantity here on Amazon and ordered it several times . I absolutely love it and decided to upgrade to this larger size because it is a much better value . The savings are incredible ! I recommend this to anyone that cooks with vanilla extract . Try it ; you will like it !	1
So good and the flavor explodes with vanilla . With the cost of foods exploding at the market and everywhere , this is one product that is a decent buy to have on your shelf . You will save some money . Love it .	1
This vanilla was recommended by a Craftsy class by Colette Christian . It 's a huge bottle ! ! ! I may never buy vanilla again . I never knew vanilla could taste so good . WOW ! Makes me want to bake more and more and more .	1
I use vanilla bean paste almost exclusively in the baked goods that I sell . This is a great product at a great price . I was paying MUCH more for it in the stores.HIghly recommend . Great flavor !	1
In my opinion , this is the best vanilla out there . The flavor is good , you can buy it in huge bottles and it 's got those cute little specks of vanilla bean in it . I put vanilla in everything I bake , it 's my favorite flavor . Does n't cook out , stays strong in your baked goodies . Highly recommend .	1
Excellent , tasty treats ; great servce too ! I would recommendthese to anyone who eats healthy food and snacks . Quickdelivery and on time ! Thank you , Marcia San Diego	1
Light and tasty ! ! ! My favorite go to dessert when I need some carb but do n't want to over do it .	1
My mother has very few vices when it comes to food . But for a long time , she got these French Twists from Sams Club , the only snack food she every showed a preference for . Then ... they were gone . We tried getting her the churros from Taco Bell , but they were bigger than she wanted . These are the original , snack size twists that she loves . I see some reviewers received opened or stale bags , but the ones we got were fine . My local grocery store has started carrying the Barry 's brand , but only the new flavors , not the original sugar and cinnamon . Glad to find them here !	1
I have bought these ar grocery stores before and really like them but they are expensive . Initially I was afraid that I would be getting crumbs via mail but they turned out whole . Amazon did a great job packaging them . They are light and a fairly healthy alternative to other mid morning or afternoon snacks . I have lost a lot of weight but I love my sweets and these satisfy my craving for sweets ... .just do n't eat a bag at one sitting which would be easy to do .	1
Like most country folks , I spend a lot of time trying to get the wild livestock on my property , arrows and atatali tend to be hard to use to hit small critters like rabbits and squirrels , shotguns and .22 tend to be noisy and scare the others making it difficult to get enough to feed the host of people that are waiting back at the house for dinner . This is a real time saver for only a few hundred dollars , I can feed all . It would be better if it came with the fur and head so I could tan those and make a nice coat , hat or bed cover , after tanning the skin . The best part of it is now my flower bed is over run with squirrels and rabbits .	1
There are newer more modern methods of pregnancy detection . These rabbits can be spared . Early pioneers in pregnancy testing came up with the & # 34 ; Friedman test. & # 34 ; , An improvement on the 1927 test developed by Bernhard Zondek and Selmar Aschheim that used mice ( You ca n't sell dead mice on Amazon ) . The rabbit test was an advance and consisted of injecting the tested woman 's urine into a female rabbit . Examining the rabbit 's ovaries a few days later you would find a change in response to a hormone only secreted by pregnant women . The hormone , human chorionic gonadotropin ( hCG ) , is produced during pregnancy and indicates the presence of a fertilized egg . The rabbit test became very popular and the supply of dead rabbits increased . The term & # 34 ; rabbit test & # 34 ; was first recorded in 1949 but became a common phrase in the English language . The people who did n't know any better thought the injected rabbit would die only if the woman was pregnant . The phrase & # 34 ; the rabbit died & # 34 ; became as euphemism for a positive pregnancy test . Actually all rabbits used for the test died , because they had to be surgically opened in order to examine the ovaries . While it was possible to do this without killing the rabbit , it was generally deemed not worth the trouble and expense , the cheapskates ! Due to medical advances , use of a live animal is no longer required . Folks the rabbits do n't have to die . Do n't promote their demise by purchasing this product.A replacement for the rabbit test uses frogs , specifically the African clawed frog , which like all frogs lays eggs instead of getting pregnant , and therefore can yield a positive result on the test without the need to be cut open in order to prove it . So do your pregnancy testing on frogs not rabbits .	1
My friend at the Wizard 's university kept getting banished to the Forbidden Zone for doing horrible experiments to reanimate the bodies of the deceased with dark , evil energies that he could not truly control . After the fifth escape , he finally listened to me and got about 50 of these . They are small , so they 're easy to store in a freezer and they do n't contain enough dark energy in them to tear a hole in the thin fabric that separates our reality from the mystic aether when their tiny frames are shot through with eldritch magic and move not of their own accord but the will of my friend , who forges pacts in blood with long-forgotten dread gods.Zombie bunnies only eat vegetables so you do n't need a helmet to protect your brain and 300 of them work just as well as any 50 regular zombies.A GREAT VALUE FOR ANY NECROMANCER	1
Daddy delivers is a big way ... Just tie a string on it and this obedient pet will follow you everywhere !	1
My only complaint with this product is that other animals do n't come in this form . Please , PLEASE start marketing other fresh , whole food animals , such as deer , elk , water buffalo , and angels !	1
I bought two , left them alone in the refrigerator for a week , and now I have thirty-eight.Off to buy a bigger fridge .	1
These fresh whole rabbits are okay , but they 're grossly overpriced . I recommend you go by the Roadkill Market and get one of the ones that were run over by an 18-wheeler . They 're much less expensive , and if you do n't mind the guts being all squashed together , they 're a good buy .	1
My backyard houses the fattest , best-fed rabbit in the world . Bunnykins has eaten dozens of costly perennials and organic veggies in my garden for the last year . I spent 50 on a `` cruelty-free '' trap , and baited it with fresh produce , and the rabbit still refuses to be caught . If I ever catch it , I now know how to dispose of the carcass .	1
I 've already apologized for my miserable luck at keeping fish and other domestic animals alive ... I 've admitted I 'm no good with pets ... so stop pestering me already . When this `` fresh whole rabbit '' fad caught on , I asked myself , `` Could this be the solution to my decades-long run of defunct critters ? '' And it was . But be warned , I would categorize this little rodent as `` less responsive '' than most pets . It seems to be most obedient with the `` Stay ! '' command.Pets with heads are overrated .	1
My favorite holiday , Easter , is right around the corner . Easter is one of the most solemn and holy days on the calendar . It 's a day when families come together to dress up in pastel leisure suits , clock in at church for the year , and spend the weekend celebrating that time when the Romans nailed a chocolate bunny to a cross , and it came back three days later as a bag of marshmallow peeps.Or something . I sort of skimmed that part in Sunday School.Anyway , it 's pretty great . So I decided to stock up on Easter party supplies.Anyone can hide plastic eggs ; I thought the kids in my neighborhood deserved a REAL Easter experience . They should have an ACTUAL bunny rabbit , giving out candy and treats -- just like in the Easter cartoons.So I bought this rabbit , thinking that 'fresh ' and 'whole ' were great qualities for an Easter bunny . Sadly , I did n't think about 'alive ' or 'unskinned ' , of which this thing is neither . So my idea of training it to hand out candy sort of went out the window.No matter . I stuffed the carcass full of Peeps and Reese 's pieces , and strung it up by the legs in a tree in the yard . The kids took turns whacking at it with barbecue tongs until it all came tumbling out , like some sort of hairless Easter party pinata.I 've never seen kids cry so much while they 're picking up candy . Somebody ought to teach these children the TRUE meaning of Easter .	1
This is thin brittle Kombu seaweed . I like the Eden Foods Kombu more which is thicker and more flavorful ; but this Welpac Dashi Kombu seaweed still made good miso soup .	1
true Asian sea weed . fast shipping . Frest actually for being dried . Expands well , flavorful and very healthy . Will buy double orders next time .	1
I use this in miso soup . Soak it in tepid water before adding it to the miso soup . Oh boy !	1
Love this for making my miso soup	1
Nice thick leaves . We 're not talking about Nori seaweed you use to wrap your expensive raw fish and rice with before gobbling them down . Sure , in the past you 've had a few sheets of the Nori Seaweed hanging around in the plastic ziplock . Every once in a blue moon you tear or scissors a few strips in a packet of Top Ramen to give it an authentic taste ( yuck ) look ( who are you kidding ) Go ahead and order this pack of Welpac 's & # 34 ; Dashi Kombu Dried Seaweed & # 34 ; then you have two more stops to make . Miko & # 34 ; Shiro Miso Non Gmo No MSG added 32.5 oz ( bean paste ) and Anjinomoto Hon Dashi ( Soup Stock ) You will never go down the Top Ramen aisle again . I double dog dare you ...	1
This is amazing stuff . Make my own Miso soup regularly and would be lost without this stuff . The local market had it but I guess no one ever bought it so it sat there for a few years while the package degraded.Ordered it from Amazon and got a new package and a fresh product . Perfect Dashi , my friends told me it was the best Miso soup they ever had .	1
As described . I have n't tried yet , but I love seaweed . Ca n't wait to make some maki and maybe chomp on some sheets as snacks .	1
According to a scientific study of Japanese seaweed eaters , `` When kombu is boiled in water for 15 minutes , it can lose up to 99 % of its iodine content , while iodine in sargassum , a similar brown seaweed , loses around 40 % [ 28,29 ] . Processed kelp is often boiled in dye for half an hour ( `` ao-kombu '' or `` kizami-kombu '' ) before hanging to dry [ 21 ] , a process which can reduce seaweed iodine content before it is consumed . When kelp is used to flavor soup stocks , the seaweed is often removed after boiling , resulting in soup stock high in iodine . `` Many people avoid eating kombu because it contains way too much iodine . According to the Linus Pauling Institute , people with an extremely high iodine intake will substantially increase their risk of developing thyroid papillary cancer but substantially decrease their risk of developing thyroid follicular cancer . Thyroid papillary cancer is less aggressive and has a better prognosis than thyroid follicular cancer.However , iodine , selenium , and zinc are the 3 antioxidant minerals in human nutrition . In my opinion , a high intake of these 3 beneficial antioxidant minerals might very likely slightly lower our risk of developing all cancers . Thyroid cancer is extremely rare . Even in Japan , where people eat a huge quantity of iodine from seaweed , only 1 man in 100,000 develops thyroid cancer and only 3 women in 100,000 develop thyroid cancer . Hiroshima and Nagasaki had the highest rates of thyroid cancer in Japan , not the northeast coast of Japan where seaweed consumption is extremely high.Technically , `` brown '' seaweeds such as kombu ( kelp ) , arame ( kelp ) , limu moui ( kelp ) , wakame , mozuku , and hijiki are not plants . Biologists have placed `` brown '' seaweeds under Kingdom Chromalveolata instead of Kingdom Plantae . However , `` red '' seaweeds such as nori ( laver ) , ogo ( limu ) , and dulse are classified as plants . `` Brown '' seaweeds have rootlike structures that cling to the ocean bottom but they lack true roots , true stems , and true leaves . Also , all `` brown '' seaweeds are rich in the extremely beneficial marine polysaccharide , fucoidan , and the extremely beneficial marine carotenoid , fucoxanthin . By contrast , green vegetables growing on land and `` red '' seaweeds are rich in the carotenoids , lutein , zeaxanthin , neoxanthin , and violaxanthin but contain zero fucoxanthin and zero fucoidan.Biologists have shown that the reason why nobody who lives within 300 miles of the ocean has ever developed an iodine deficiency is because the kelp growing near the shoreline manufacture large amounts of iodine gas which escapes to float above the surface of the ocean and gets blown inland by the wind.Attached to the surface of all `` brown '' seaweeds are probiotic saltwater bacteria which manufacture an enzyme which allows humans to digest the extremely beneficial polysaccharides and extremely beneficial carotenoids in `` brown '' seaweeds . Without these probiotic saltwater bacteria , `` brown '' seaweeds would pass through our digestive tracts without being digested.Yes , this product is delicious but because salt always contains cancer-causing nitrosamines , it 's a good idea to soak this product in water for at least 5 minutes to remove as much salt as possible . This product was farmed in the coastal areas of South Korea .	1
If you are trying this for the first time my suggestion would be to cut the seaweed into minimum 1/4 & # 34 ; x 1 & # 34 ; pieces egg noodle style as this particular brand is very substantial and a little goes a long way . Although I have not had the opportunity for many I would try this in any variations of soups , not only Asian .	1
I was using the bottle of Dashi . I saw a chef using Kombu and shaved bonito flakes . So I tried It with Kombu and bonito . This is a whole new taste in Dashi , plus the addition miso .	1
This tub lasts a long time around our house , but they stay fresh . I like to be able to grab and go and this large size tub makes that very handy .	1
You really ca n't compare these with twizlers , twizlers are a different candy entirely . You might as well compare these with m & ms ; or lamb chops.Soft , delicious , perfect .	1
IF you like red vines , then this is the way to buy them.If you have never had red vines , only swizzlers , I warn you that they taste very different and have a very different texture.Swizzlers are really fruity to me where red vines have a more & # 34 ; licorice & # 34 ; taste . They are not as soft as swizzlers , more chewy . That being said , I prefer them to swizzlers any day of the year .	1
This was my first time trying Redvines , and when I first opened it I did not like them . The more I ate , the better they started tasting . I do n't know if they are just something you have to get used to ( try not drinking soda for a few months then drinking coke or pepsi , terrible . ) or if the taste just gets better as they aerate . Either way they are delicious now , and I ca n't stop eating them .	1
I buy this for my cube in my office and for $ 22 a month I sure hear a lot of gossip and office politics ! It get unlikely people in my cube and these get em talking , people will say the darnest things to please you in return of a few red vines : ) Cheap price to pay for the benefits . As for the red vines , they are a red vines , who does n't like them ? ! They come fresh every time and taste great !	1
I have been using this for years ! ! ! I put it on everything it is so good ! Every one needs this kitchen staple !	1
i was never a believer in ready made ingredients . I always thought it had to be from scratch to be good . For the most part it remains true however Borsari seasoned salt is an amazing exception ! How they mix it up i do n't know ; what i do know is that my food tastes so much better ! Glad to see it is on amazon !	1
Whole Foods got me with this when I wandered through at a time they were offering free tastes . Wow , world 's tastiest chicken breast ! So I bought a bottle of Borsari Seasoned Salt - Original Blend ( the black label bottle . ) Unlike most `` free sample '' induced purchases , Borsari seasoning is something I 've bought again and again . I hate to buy large spice bottles and then wonder how old they are when I go to use them again . ( My mother has spice bottles in her kitchen that , I kid you not , came with her spice rack at her 1960 's wedding ... ) The Borsari blend works very well for simple dishes I like to cook -- pot roast , roast turkey breast , chicken breasts ... Recently , we invited friends for dinner who have severe dietary restrictions . My friend and her daughter ca n't eat any gluten , soy or dairy . I was cooking the chicken and only after I sprinkled on my Borsari did I realize it does n't say anywhere on the bottle in an explicit way if it is allergen-free ! So I wrote to the contact email on the company website . Within a few hours , I had this response from Betsy : '' Borsari is completely gluten free and free of soy ingredients . Borsari is produced in a gluten and soy free facility . It is 100 % natural . `` For those like the previous reviewer with other allergies , here are the complete ingredients : Sea salt , kosher salt , fresh garlic , fresh basil , fresh rosemary , black pepper , nutmeg . ( No preservatives , MSG , Gluten or dehydrated ingredients . )	1
I have been buying this at a local market but they do n't always have it . I am so glad I found it on amazon . This is by far the best seasoning for steaks and roasts . I have used other products before , but when I tried this , nothing compares . I do not use anything else as this gives the best flavor to meats . Have not tried it on fish or poultry yet but I am sure it would be just as good . You will not be disappointed with this product . Excellent ! !	1
I bought this based on the other reviews and i have not been disappointed . It is so excellent that i have used it on almost everything i 've cooked this past month from meats to vegetables to scrambled eggs . The key is to just use a little though , since the seasoning tends to `` grow '' after a few minutes . I 'm ordering more for myself and to add to gourmet food gift baskets ( its that good ! )	1
My wife likes this tea . This is a good product that was as described . It arrived on time and was well packaged .	1
This tea is great I love it . Cant live without it.We drink it when we can get a stomach ache or have any tummy troubles.Very mild and delicate .	1
It has no sugar so I bought it . I mean all cranberries are sweetened but this is not so I am happy with this .	1
Great taste and Anti Bloat ! This was recommended for relaxing and it does that too.A nice change from other Teas .	1
I bought the tea bags over the pills because I prefer to drink tea . I am not disappointed . This tea has a wonderfully calming effect without inhibiting my thinking processes . Many times , when working on assignments , I will feel the knots tightening in my neck , so I make this tea . Knots disappear . I ca n't say how it would work for others , but I will continue to use it .	1
Ive tried many different teas and I just couldnt find one that I really enjoyed until my mother introduced me to Mullein Tea and since then Ive become addicted ! Great tea to drink anytime but I especially enjoy it just before bed !	1
This is an interesting tea . It has a light sweet flavor . Supposedly has health benefits . Need to drink more to get the benefits .	1
I was looking for Lemongrass `` tea '' without the tea ( green , white , decaf or otherwise ) -- just basic lemongrass in tea bags . This is it ! The flavor is lemony without being harsh . Very smooth , silky and pleasant while at the same time delivering rich , full-bodied flavor.I find it relaxing , easy on the stomach , nice right before bedtime or first thing in the morning.One warning , however : Lemongrass in any form -- including teas , spices and foods -- is NOT recommended for those who are pregnant or breast-feeding .

I have been having problems with my bladder . Interstital Cystitis is a chronic condition and also effects the colon . I suffer from severe constipation ( IBS ) also . I take fiber during the day and make sure I get enough in my diet . In the morning I drink a cup of Alvita Senna tea and within 1 to 1/2 hrs . I have elimination . This is the only thing that has worked for me . I have tried many other laxatives which do not work and bother my bladder . This product does not . I have also drank it at night with good results in the morning . Doctors have said not to use this continually because you could develop dependence . However , my condition is unbearable without it . At last my doctor agreeded that if I was going to take something daily then he suggested this tea . I highly recommend it for people with my condition or for individuals who take a lot of medications that tend to slow down the system . I have placed an order for more and will continue to use this great product . By the way , I had purchased another brand before I bought this brand and it was of terrible quality . What a difference . This product has great quality and also I like the tea bags being natural and not bleached with chemicals .	1
This tea is great for detoxing your body without having to deal with weakness or fatigue due to over detoxification . The flavor is light and you do n't need a sweetener .	1
Recommend it to all . Lovely natural sweet delicate flavor and add some raw honey is a great cold kicker . I loved it during a URI , upper respiratory infection and it was fabulous . Soothed my sore throat and helped ease the coughing . I now brew it for cold tea as well . Very refresshing .	1
Have tried another Dandelion Root Tea and the taste was horrible . This tea has a very mild pleasant taste and I look forward to my afternoon cup of tea .	1
I have found Mullein Tea to be good for respiratory problems . I bought this tea and have enjoyed it sweetened with a bit of honey . Good stuff !	1
This tea was ok and my wife liked it , My brother in law also liked it and he is a tea totter	1
I bought this with doubt thinking it might not be that great but I was wrong . This tea tastes great and I would buy it again .	1
Valerian itself smells pretty bad and the taste ... well , the addition of mint makes it better , but this tea is still an acquired taste . I 've bought this particular brand of Valerian Mint tea for several years and have found it to be a helpful , natural sleep aid.I heat about 6 ounces of water and let the bag steep for at least 7 to 8 minutes so it 's nice and concentrated . When I 'm drinking it to help sleep , I have it 30-40 minutes before going to bed . It definitely helps me feel more relaxed and fall to sleep a little easier than usual . Although Valerian is herbal , check with your doctor or pharmacist to make sure it wo n't interact with any OTC or prescription medications you 're taking .	1
I get skinless , boneless thighs , slice onions , season with garlic powder , onion powder and dill weed and wrap thighs and onions in cheese cloth and tie with twine and put in water with a lemongrass tea bag , chicken broth , drop of orange oil and poach for about 45 minutes . I buy all the natural spices , twine and cheesecloth from Amazon . Really , really moist and good . I made the tea to drink and do n't like it one bit .	1
This tea is very soothing to the tummy . I drink it to settle my stomach and it works very well for me and my family .	1
This tea i had never tried before , it has a very good flavor and will probably order again when I do the tea diet again	1
This tea has wonderful flavor and is a very good quality product . I will buy it again and have recommended it to others .	1
Very nice tea . I actually mix it with a black tea and drink it every day and have noticed that I do feel calmer and happier .	1
lovely tea for that time of the month helps ease cramps and ive been buying this tea for about two years now and ive never had an issue with drinking it ... very lite taste and i just love it	1
We order this by the 3-pack . My husband and I feel that it does help you relax , and does so very quickly !	1
It seems as though every time I write a rave review about a product , the quality goes downhill.However , at this point , this Lemongrass tea is excellent . Now watch the price soar , taste go bland , etc .	1
I have used this tea for 2 of my 3 pregnancies . It 's a little hard to 1st get used to the taste but now I love it . It helps strengthen the uterus . I started drinking it in my 3rd trimester and drank it for a few weeks postpartum as well .	1
Almost tastes like Parsley ? I tried to plant the product and it just wo n't grow ? Ca n't figure it out ! Great on Salads	1
I used a higher priced senna for several years and out of the need to economize I tried alvita . Works just as well and is not individually wrapped as the others are and for me it 's just one less thing I have to do considering I fix this every evening for me and hubby ... I have medical problems so anything that saves me extra step I 'm happy for it ...	1
Drank some as soon as I got it . Unfortunately , the flavor is so un-memorable , that I have n't thought of it much since ! I do like that I could mix it with any other tea flavor , however , because I do believe that it has beneficial properties . It was sealed in a back in the box , and while that bag is not resealable , I expect that as long as I remember to , I will drink it up before it goes stale . Not sure I 'd notice the flavor difference , honestly .	1
First time trying this tea out , was told it was good for many things . And yes I like it and will buy again .	1
You can compare it to unsweetened black tea , but palpable and soothing . It is one of nature 's best blood purifiers in addition to being great for women anytime . It 's great year round and for flu season , and you can ice it too . Sweeten it up with a bag of chamomile or red clover . Spearmint & peppermint tea compliment it well too -- or add value to that flavored stuff from the supermarket w/this.You can drink this like water and I ca n't say enough about how good this tea is for well being , you 'll probably instantly feel better .	1
Herbal teas are usually on the weak side when it comes to flavor . Not so with this one , I drink lots of it hot and cold all year round . When I need an energy kick , I brew a Yerba Mate in with the Cranberry and the cranberry flavor still stands out . Yum .	1
Its tea . I purchased it for the benefits of hyssop . The flavor is bland , but Im hoping it is strong enough to see the benefits .	1
This tea has a strong pungent smell that my husband hates ( he says stinky socks ) but call me weird I really like it . I like parmasean cheese too though and that stinks . Anyhow , I find both the aroma very relaxing and find that after a cup I am tired and ready to go to bed . I am not even sure if it is the aroma or the actual tea that is knocking me out but for some reason it is so right for this body .	1
I enjoy this tea , but I did find it a little bland . If you add honey or sugar , it does improve the taste . I 've been trying different ginger teas for health reasons , and while this tea is good , it 's not my absolute favorite . You do need to steep the teabag for quite a while to get the full taste .	1
This is my husbands favorite tea ! He absolutely loves licorice and this tea really hits the spot . He drinks it pretty much every evening .	1
Taste = 100 % Function = 100 % This is a great natural diuretic and overall taste is pretty good . Really does reduce salt .	1
Love the aroma and the taste . Orange honey goes great with it . I drink it daily . Seems to work great when I get any stomach issues ... would highly recommend this product .	1
Wow , this tea is about half the price of one of the other best selling brands ( even with paying for shipping ) and it is all hibiscus . Back in the day , I used the Alvita brand and got it from my health food store ( since closed ) and I started ( lazy me ) picking up whatever was available at the supermarket . Then , voila , I find Alvita on Amazon . Done .	1
Item arrived quickly . I am Using it for my family when they get headaches . And , for the all around health benefits . A little spicey . I drink it without sweetener , but , for others I put honey in ! Would buy again !	1
is great for the eyes . Got it at a good price , & it tastes great . Nothing else to say . Period .	1
I heard this tea might kill cancer cells so I ordered a box to see how it tasted because I have a niece with lung cancer . The tea tastes great and I should have ordered more . I 'm giving her this box and so we do n't know if it will help her but it surely wo n't hurt and it tastes great .	1
I usually dont compare down to this degree for something like this , but since I had it both available , I did a direct side-by-side taste test ( subjective ) at home with another brand offered by Amazon , Traditional Medicinals Organic Roasted Dandelion Root , 16-Count Boxes ( Pack of 6 ) . As for the Alvita brand , my senses tell me ... Smell : Good ! Same nutty aroma that resembles roasted tahini , or peanut brittle.Color : Medium brown , with some reddish tone . Not as dark as Traditional Medicinals.Taste : Good , but not the best I 've tasted . Initial flavor like some kind of nutty coffee drink is all there and good , just not as rich . There is also a very slight tang aftertaste.Differences aside , this is a great healthy tea that supposedly promotes healthy liver function . I started drinking this last time I got a caution that my liver enzymes were boderline high . I have yet to confirm that it helped , but the psychological benefits are helping a bit ; ) . It tastes good , and somewhat resembles hot coffee in the morning , only more healthier.On a comparitive note , the tea bags themselves are cheap . They do not have draw strings like most tea bags have , they are not individually sealed or wrapped , and they come grouped together in a non-resealing package . If this does n't effect you that much , then I would recommend this buy because you get more tea bags for your money . Otherwise , I think you will get a better experience with Traditional Medicinals . As a final tip , with either brand , the more you steep the more flavor comes out .	1
This has a slight coffee taste to it and supposed to be full of good stuff for your health . A little sugar , or Splenda , and I 'm good to go . I really like it .	1
Interested in this tea for its joint benefits . Did some research online on various sites and this link is a comprehensive source for the various health benefits found in drinking Nettle Tea [ ... ] { copy & paste this link } I drink other teas from this same brand and the quality and flavor compared to other brands of the same type of tea are not even comparable . I highly value Traditional Medicinals for both taste and quality .	1

I bought them as a gift for a friend who loves this tea . She seems very happy . Arrived fast and in great condition . Thank you !	1
This is the most excellent tea . It is very smooth and relaxing . It tastes like chamomile tea a bit but milder . I love to have a cup in the evening with a drop or two of stevia to sweeten . Definitely will buy more .	1
I have asthma and have adverse reactions to many medications other than a rescue inhaler . I looked around for other products to help with my asthma . I tried this tea , it really does help to relieve my symptoms . The heavy breathing is relieved , it gets better every day . I do n't need to use the inhaler in the afternoon and I can go longer on just one puff of my inhaler daily . Hopefully my asthma will improve so I will just use the inhaler for emergencies . I use 2 tea bags to make 1 cup , and drink only 1 cup a day . It will take time though , in the meantime I am very happy with this product .	1
I 've a difficult time drinking red raspberry leaf tea in the past . I wanted to try it again during my second pregnancy for uterine health . This time I steeped it in boiling water , added lots of honey , and poured it over ice . It 's still not the best tasting tea variety , but this particular brand seems a bit more palletable than some others . As far as it 's potency/effectiveness , I suppose I wo n't know until the baby comes ( although realistically I 'm not sure I 'll even know then ) .This price is amazing , too . I kicked myself for paying twice as much at a local health food store . I will definitely be buying my next box here instead .	1
My mind races so fast that sometime even i cant keep up with the pace and especially towards the end of the day when I am suppose to be winding down , my brain sure are n't in that same space and hence I dont get a great night sleep . I will drink this tea at the end of the night to make me calm down naturally and it does help . Does not have a strong flavor even after steeping it for over 10 minutes .	1
Alvita provides tea of consistent goood quality . Rooibos is a wonderful tea that stands on its own as a tasty tea , or as a substitute for those of us who can not have caffeine ! ! This tea brews up to a nice dark earthy flavor which I love to drink with cream ! ! Delicious ! ! I like it strong so I brew it with two bags for at least 20 minutes and then reheat.In addition to the delicious flavor , rooibos has health benefits due to a high antioxidant level that some are saying is higher than green tea .	1
Tea is always refreshing , but this is just helpful . Not only does it have a nutritious value , but it is easy to use . This also goes well withMenopause Support- 3 Bottles/ 1 Month Supply . All-Natural Herbal Remedy for the Relief of Hot Flashes and Other Menopause Symptomsas it helps to keep you relaxed . Well I ca n't think any other reason why you should n't at least try this tea .	1
I bought this tea thinking it would taste like a rose . I was only half right . While the rose flavor is still there , you have to really search for it . I think it takes a few cups to do that because this is primarily a fruity tea . After you knock the first few cups down and find the subtle rose flavor , you 'll find that it tastes like what a rose would taste like if it were a fruit . Which is basically what rose hips are . After drinking this entire box , I found that I really liked it . I was sad when the box was gone and I do intend to get some more soon.Just as an added note , I feel this needs to be mentioned . If you 're like me and like to suck on the teabag , I do not recommend doing it with this tea ! The bags themselves are not very thick and will break and you will have an explosion of mushy rose hips in your mouth !	1
We eliminated fruit juices and any drink that contains HFCS or sugar in any form . One of our alternatives is this yummy caffeine free tea that is so good for one 's urinary tract . Using stevia in this tea it is great either hot or cold . Teaching our granddaughters that this is much better than Kool-Aid . They need to learn to eliminate sugar early and this is a great substitute	1
Wanted to try this spearmint tea as the wild mint in our town is probably gone now , due to flooding and the mint tea at the farmer 's market leaves much to be desired . Hooray for providing this product which I plan to add to regular tea during hot weather . I ordered 3-4 products from Amazon recently that I would either have to special order or run around all over town trying to find . How convenient this service is for my needs .	1
I loved the taste but I was told this would help with labor and delivery . Did not work for me . Guess it 's an old wives tale .	1
I bought Alfalfa for all its beneficial properties . First , the capsules and along with it I purchased a three pack of this tea as a backup . I was pleasantly surprised when I opened this one and made it . It is n't strong smelling or tasting . It is actually quite mild . You would n't even know that you 're drinking alfalfa with this one.Overall , this was a worthwhile purchase that I have no hesitation in recommending to others .	1
I do n't tolerate caffeine well and I really miss my coffee and black tea . Herbal teas did n't do it for me , but Rooibus Leaf Tea looks like coffee and comes as close to tasting like coffee as anything I 've found . I do n't know if there 's any scientific basis for this , but a cup before bedtime seems to make me sleep well . This is one herbal tea I really like . I recommended it to a friend who also had to give up coffee , and I recently included a box of Rooibus in a birthday gift ensemble for my favorite insomniac .	1
My wife was diagnosed with cancer . Imagine my surprise to read of some data indicating dandelion tea has some good effects for cancer patients . I can remember as a child my grandmother making dandelion tea , but back then , this and chamomile was all we had . If you could not find it growing outside , you were not going to have it . The taste is fine but I am leaving most of it to her to drink .	1
I have used Pau D'Arco tea for a few decades to help my body fight off yeast infections . I always found it unpalatable , the taste was so harsh . A couple years ago , I discovered Traditional Medicinals ' Pau D'Arco blend . The other ingredients that they add make it quite pleasant . Then , I discovered Alvita 's Pau D'Arco nearly a year ago . What a surprise ! It is the pure herb , but tastes much like Traditional Medicinals ' blend . It is not my favorite tea to drink , but it is my favorite way to get Pau D'Arco . I find that Alvita teas are always excellent in flavor . I associate flavor with quality , thus I think I am getting a lot of the active ingredient in their brand .	1
and smooth ( really helps ) for sore throat there is no doubts . The taste though not all that `` usual tea '' : ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) if you know what i mean .	1
It works for me I like the peppermint flavorI take it every night especially if I ate some junkfood ! ! ! works every morning like clockworkWould recommend	1
A great product . Tastes mild , no bitter taste - wonderfully soothing , especially with honey . Works well without stomach cramping or that sudden urgent feeling . Have been using this off and on for years and I highly recommend it .	1
We always have this tea on hand . If we need help with our system this tea truly works . I have friends using this tea and they are very satisfied . Excellent tea .	1
***It can cause cramping if you do n't drink enough water** Please make sure you follow this tea with a glass or two of water . It is very effective and usually works within 8-12 hours . I like the taste of the tea . It tastes `` herbally '' with a slight sweetness .	1
I am so happy with this product . My son ca n't have dairy , soy or gluten , so a margarine was always a big challenge . This has satisfied that need perfectly . There 's no coconut taste , so he readily eats it . ( I do n't know any kids who like coconut ! ) . That 's the only use so far for us , but it seems like an ideal oil for cooking as well .	1
I 've bought several jars of this and thought it was ok . Lately I 've been buying other brands because they are less expensive . I now know this a higher quality oil than most . When I use the Spectrum Oil I can cook at a high temperature and food does n't burn . I tried the same thing with other brands of coconut oil and the oil starts smoking soon after the pan gets hot . I also prefer the taste of this product . It has absolutely no coconut smell or taste at all . This makes it a perfect substitute for shortening in recipes like biscuits , frosting etc . The other brands I tried had a slight coconut flavor , limiting the recipes you can use it in . If a recipes tastes good with the coconut flavor , I 'd prefer to use unrefined coconut oil as I believe it is healthier . I do wish the price was lower , but other than that I highly recommend this oil !	1
My wife is the one who is using this product . She told me that it is great and does what she wants with regard to the moisturizing . Easy to apply and makes her skin very smooth . She really likes this item and it is exactly what the doctor ordered for the purpose .	1
I buy this at the local store , and it does not have any smell . I use it in my tea , and for cooking and am losing weight . i bought some from amazon , super virgin , it smells and I ca n't hardly use it . this is the best buy .	1
Love this stuff . My friend recommended this and I am so pleased . My skin feels great and the smell is awesome . The only thing , I thought it was oil , liquid but it is actually butter , solid . Not a problem though it melts on contact .	1
Love Organic Coconut Oil ! Much cheaper to by on Amazon than my local grocery store . Reminds me of crisco , but healthy . Goes great with a little pat of real butter when cooking up fish .	1
I used this with both of my children when I went back to work and needed to pump enough milk . I could n't stand the taste of the mother 's milk teas , so this was SO helpful to me ! It worked within 2-3 days . I did need to take about 8-10 capsules per day , and I did smell like maple syrup ( fenugreek smells like maple and with such a high dose it does come out in your sweat ) , but it was worth it . Neither of my children seemed to notice/mind , so I do n't think it changed the taste of the milk at all . I highly recommend this for any nursing mothers trying to increase their production !	1
I bougth this to use while nursing my newborn . I started taking it when she was 2 days old . Nursing has been great , she gets plenty of milk & I have no concerns about running out of milk . This is my 3rd time nursing and this time has been the easiest , i dont know for sure if it 's because of the fenugreek , but all i can say is that my baby is super happy . so i would reccommend it if you are concerend about running low on milk . Also , i read that this herb also is a great breast health support in general , and can help prevent breast cancer , which runs in my family . So i will definatly continue taking it even after i 'm done nursing ! Plus , i gave 5 stars b/c amazon has the best price for this . I checked 3 other popular health stores and the best price is online ! !	1
Pay attention to the required amount to take though -- you 're supposed to take between three and five a day , so there 's about a month or two 's supply here , depending on your intake.It worked for what I needed it to though -- It 's great for lowering blood sugar and helping a breastfeeding mom produce , amongst other bonuses .	1
Purchased these for the wife since she was n't producing enough milk for our newborn . Within taking the pills in one day she noticed she started producing much more milk . Much more milk that we have a surplus in our freezer . Not sure what causes the milk production but these were recommended from her doctor .	1
Our baby was born in early October . My wife wanted to feed him the way nature intended and we were visited by a lactation nurse at the hospital . She advised us and said that if we ever had problems with obtaining enough milk , we might try Fenugreek , a supplement available at health-food stores . Of course , we forgot the peculiar name shortly thereafter . Well , my wife started to have difficulties a few weeks later in keeping up with the baby 's growing needs . We mentioned the problem to a young couple who had a recent child . The woman said she had the same problem and told us to get Fenugreek . She said it had worked for her . There was that strange-sounding word again.We purchased Nature 's Way Fenugreek shortly thereafter . Strange stuff . It 's an herbal supplement in capsule form , but the label does n't say what it 's for . I guess you just have to know . Evidently , it 's one of those things that takes a certain amount of faith . Anyway , since we heard about it from two completely independent sources , my wife started taking it . Well , it was n't a miracle . There was no immediate change . However , my wife gradually began to keep up with the baby 's needs and has kept up ever since . Was it the Fenugreek ? Perhaps . Maybe she was just adapting to the new baby . It 's hard to tell . However , if anyone is having this problem , I 'd say the Fenugreek is worth a try.Gary Peterson	1
I 'm a working mother who was suffering from a steadily decreasing milk supply after returning to work . Despite pumping every three hours at work ( for a total of 3 pumping sessions per day ) , I was starting to have to top off my baby 's bottles with frozen milk from my freezer stash . At first it was an extra ounce a day , then two , then three . As any breastfeeding mother knows , that 's a dangerous road to go down because it can lead to even more supply issues in the future.I decided to try supplementing with fenugreek , but because I am naturally very suspicious of supplements and worried about side effects , I did a ton of research on the pros/cons of fenugreek before starting supplementation . My research suggests that fenugreek can have an effect on blood sugar levels , so people with blood sugar issues should consult a doctor before trying the supplement . I 've learned to minimize the blood sugar effects for myself by always taking my fenugreek right after eating my main meals . This way , the blood sugar effects are more than offset by the food in my system.The biggest mistake people make when trying fenugreek to increase milk supply is to not take enough of the herb . It is critical to take enough , or you will not see any effect . Some women can see an effect by taking 2 610mg pills three times a day ( for a total of 6 pills a day ) . Personally , I had to increase my dosage to 3 610mg pills three times a day ( for a total of 9 pills a day ) to get the desired effect . Also , you have to be very consistent and really work hard not to skip any doses . After a couple days of starting supplementation , I saw an increase in my supply , so I am now able to pump enough milk for my baby 's bottles during the day while I am at work . Thanks to the fenugreek , I 'm getting a 2-3 ounce boost per day , which is not a huge amount , but it 's all I needed . Good luck !	1
I have a baby that i do n't get to see everyday . When my nursing needs to be kicked into high gear i just pop two of these three time s a day . With blessed thistle .	1
My mom takes fenugreek seed daily to control her blood sugar level . It works well and she has been able to reduce her dosage of Glucophage.The use of fenugreek for treating diabetes has been scientifically validated ( you can read abstracts by doing a keyword search on [ ... ] ) .My mom gets it from the Indian grocer where it is much cheaper , though loose and not encapsulated .	1
I had to get medical therapy to increase my milk supply for twins . Fenugreek was prescribed and it made a huge difference . Based on what the doctor told me you can try the following if you have twins or simply need to increase your milk supply : * Fenugreek is very helpful , 2 capsules three times a day with meals , eventually working your way up to 4 capsules per meal . The body gets used to it after a while so the doctor suggested going off it for a couple of days and restarting . * Nurse 8-12x a day , putting each baby to breast until they empty it ( do not time it ) - the baby is much more effective than the pump at drawing the milk out than even a hospital pump , and will help increase your supply . In effect , interrupting the feeding could be counterproductive . * You can decrease the # of sessions if the amount pumped is more than 1000 ml/ 24 hrs ( try pumping instead of nursing for one day to measure ) . You can also try weighing the baby to calculate intake , using a baby scale in grams ( same as mls for calculating ) . Note - this will be a rough estimate as the baby may be getting more milk than the pump - and some women are unable to pump much even if they can nurse well . * Alternate sides for the babies , as one may have a stronger suck . It 's possible one side will have a lot more milk than another . How you hold the baby also affects supply - if you 're right handed that side will hold the baby more firmly and they may nurse longer and increase supply more on that side . All normal . * After breastfeeding the baby , pump but only for 5 minutes or so to increase demand on your body and thus milk production . Frequency is much more important than duration . Pumping for 20 min has little effect according to the doctor ( I know , `` now I find out ? ! '' that 's what I said ) * If you have twins , read the bookMothering Multiples : Breastfeeding and Caring for Twins or More ! ( La Leche League International Book ) by Karen Kerkhoff Gromada . I wish I had read this early on . It provides solid advice on breastfeeding multiples plus a whole lot more up to 2 yrs of age . * Try to eat well and sleep at least 6 hrs . Your milk production is directly related to your health and stress levels . * If you 're able to breastfeed exclusively great but if you ca n't do n't beat yourself up over it it 's Ok to supplement ( we used Enfacare as my babies were low weight , then Enfamil Premium for one and Alimentum for our other ) . You have a lot on your hands to worry about . * Do n't try to do all feedings alone , you 'll go crazy . Have your hubby do the last feeding of the night 10 or 11 pm and the early morning one ( 6 or 7 am ) - you do the ones in between . This way , you 'll each get a solid chunk of sleep . The one who 's not `` on shift '' stays in the quiet bedroom without a monitor but with a cell phone . We had an extra bed in the nursery so it would be easier to nurse the babies - if I needed help ( two babies crying at the same time or you 're too tired ) I 'd call my hubby on the cell phone , but this rarely happens if you stage feedings ( always feed twin A first for example ) . My hubby comes in at 6 am or whenever and quietly feeds the babies before they wake up so I can sleep until 8 or so . * I kept my energy and supply up withEnsure Plus - Vanillaand oatmeal . * Google `` manual expression Stanford University '' , the video shows how to increase your milk supply significantly using manual expression . It works better than any other method even if it feels unusual . * If you do supplement and trying to increase breastfeeding , do n't stop bottle feeding cold turkey ( you may not have enough milk supply as supplementing may lower supply ) . Continue to supplement and give 1 oz or so BEFORE starting to nurse . The reason for this is that bottlefed babies are used to a faster flow and ready supply , with nursing it takes longer for the milk to let down . Giving the bottle-fed baby some formula before nursing will take the edge off his hunger and keep him from `` chomping away at the bit '' if you will - in other words it will calm him down and make the nursing experience more relaxing for mom & baby and allow baby to nurse longer . * Try a brief warm shower or use warm compresses ( try putting warm water in a diaper ) before nursing to stimulate milk let down . * Keep your eyes off the clock . Another reason to not interrupt or time breast feeding - the hind milk that lets down after the baby has been nursing a while is richer and higher in fat , more satisfying for the baby . If you stop after `` X '' minutes you may not get the hind milk . * Continue nursing 8-12x a day - do n't wait too long before feedings ( 4+ hrs ) , any sign of engorgement is letting your body know there 's less demand and will reduce milk production . Nursing every 2-3 hours is better , allow a stretch of 4 hours early in your sleeping cycle to feel better rested ( have your hubby feed baby late at night ) . * Pump for a few minutes each time you nurse to simulate increased demand and boost milk production . Manual milk expression and fenugreek will also help and over time you 'll need to supplement less as your milk production increases . * If you find that your supply is going down again , stop using Fenugreek for a few days , as according to doctors your body will get used to it after a while . Restart a few days later as if were from the beginning ( 2 capsules , 3x a day with meals , increasing to 4 x3 over time ) . * Do n't do marathon pumping . As soon as you start feeling stressed or find yourself wondering how many ounces you 've pumping , etc . you 're overthinking things and this will affect your milk supply . Stop for a few minutes and go do something else . Then pump a little more . You can leave it out at room temperature while you do this - mark the time you started & date on tape w/ a Sharpie pen to be safe . If you wait 15-30 min or so , it counts as an additional pumping session ( if you 're trying to fit more in ) . * Pumping is not always a good indicator of your real milk supply ( some women may not be able to pump much but nurse well ) - a baby scale is the most accurate measurement if you really want to know ( do n't stress this too much , just nurse until baby seems full ) . * Feed on demand and expect cluster feeding ( every 1-2 hrs ) at the witching hour and just before a growth spurt . * For me at least I always had to supplement with twins because I never had enough milk for two . I did see a huge increase in my milk supply from very little to being able to nurse one baby full time for a while . Fenugreek was a HUGE help.Lastly , this tip from a sleep doctor - to handle sleep deprivation log how many hours total you slept at night ( even if interrupted ) , find the midway point and add 12 hours . Try to take a 30-60 minute nap then , this is your natural down-time according to your inner clock and will be much better than trying to catch up on sleep on the weekends ( example - slept 12am -6 am , midway point is 3 am add 12 hrs - try to nap @ 3 pm . ) Keep a log of how long you sleep each time - always try to get at least 6 hrs.With Fenugreek , enough sleep , a good diet and the tips above , your milk supply should increase . *** UPDATE 12/27/12 - another reviewer has found that Fenugreek can trigger an allergic reaction in anyone allergic to peanuts , as they are in the same family . Please see comments section for links to study . ( Thank you G. Jager for this important info ) . This is not commonly known and was never mentioned to me by any doctor . )	1
My wife got these in the supermarket as one of her websites told her that these will help boost the milk supply during breastfeeding . They were right ! when we ran out she was producing 3-4 oz less each day ! Not good ! I ordered this on amazon and splurged for the next day delivery . Amazon 's price of this was the same price as the grocery store . However the grocery store gives you 30 count and this is 180 ... Ca n't say what else you would use Fenugreek for , but ... it sure helps increase milk supply !	1
I started taking these pills at the recommendation of a pediatrician . Started out taking 2 pills 3 times a day . I had more than enough milk to feed , supplement 1 oz after each feed and freeze some too ! When my son started gaining way ( & when I got a little lazy ) , I backed down to 2 pills once a day & still produce enough milk to feed and freeze.They taste a little strange ( herbally ... ) but nothing I ca n't get past after taking them.I 'd read in other reviews , forums , etc that they can cause the baby to be more gassy , which I would say is probably true for my son . It does n't seem to bother him though . I also read that another reviewer had been told that your body can get used to them , so stop for a short time and then start again - I think I 'm going to try that .	1
I purchased this after I had my son to stimulate my milk because it began depleting . It was able to help me produce milk .	1
I ordered the supplement after realizing that pumping at work was n't producing as much as I needed to cover what my 3-month old daughter drank at daycare , and I 'm committed to exclusively breastfeeding for as long as the AAP recommends . Currently I take two capsules with every meal ( 6 a day ) . I began to notice increased engorgement probably about 48 hours after starting the supplement . Since starting it , I 've been pumping about 3-4 ounces more per day , which is enough to cover the gap I had been concerned about . Although I myself was a bit gassy for the first few days , I did n't notice any side effects in my daughter ( and I was definitely watching out for them ) .I should say , I had to stop taking the pills for a few days due to some minor surgery , and I did notice my supply go down again . So the pills do work , but in my case at least I have to keep taking them to keep getting results . I 'm happy to do it for my baby : )	1
Fenugreek has been so typecast as a way to facilitate lactation that most guys would never dare to think of it for themselves -- much less actually try it . The fact that it contains phyto-estrogens just complicates things further if you 're concerned about testosterone levels . But sometimes things that look a bit crazy seem to work out well in unexpected ways.I started using fenugreek a year ago , discontinued it because of the testosterone concerns , and recently restarted it to help moderate anxiety symptoms from a choline-related medication I had just started . Since fenugreek 's action appears analogous in many ways to oxytocin ( a hormone closely related to empathy and the mitigation of fear/anxiety responses ) , I thought it might help to defuse these reactions . It was at least worth a shot.It does seem to have helped with the anxiety reactions ( I combined it with l-glutamine for those who are really interested ) . What surprised me completely was the very strong boost in libido that I experienced inside of three days . And when I went back and doublechecked the research on fenugreek , I found that a mid-2011 report by Australian researchers showed a 25 percent increase in male libido for those using fenugreek . So objective research says this effect of fenugreek is real . Subjectively , I know that this supplement is way more effective for me than things like saw palmetto that are commonly marketed for libido boosts.And I was n't even looking for this effect . But it works , and this is one of those side-effects that 's a keeper . Beyond this , fenugreek is commonly used around the world by both sexes to help with type 2 diabetes . It appears to help with blood-sugar levels , but I ca n't say definitively that it works . It 's inexpensive enough to be worth trying.My hoped-for long-term use for fenugreek is actually to help with what Buddhists call metta meditation , that is , focusing on lovingkindness . Research by the Center for Affective Neuroscience at the University of Wisconsin suggests that expert meditators on lovingkindness modulate the functioning of the amygdala , a component of the brain that helps to establish empathic reactions and , once again , is closely associated with oxytocin . My experience so far is that fenugreek does in fact help with empathy . This makes eminent sense . Lactation and mother-child bonding pretty much go hand in hand.If you 're interested in the underlying neurophysiology , you can probably do a much better job than me in researching this . If you 're just a guy who could use a shot in the arm for lovemaking , then this is a worthwhile supplement even if we ca n't figure out all the physiology involved . Even if none of the above effects interests you , fenugreek is used for and may help with many other things , such as digestion ( see Wikipedia for more information on such uses ) .I hope some of this proves helpful .	1
I love the price on amazon , I get this through the subscribe and save program at half the cost of my local health food store . I take two capsules , two times a day in combination with fennel ( one capsule , three times a day ) to 'boost ' my bustline . I nursed two children , and my breasts were saggy after I stopped nursing . I ca n't afford a procedure , so this was my next option , although I was very skeptical to it actually working . But , it did ! Now , the results were not huge and dramatic , but they are slightly and noticeably fuller and perkier after several months of taking the combo-it does take that long to notice a difference , so be faithful if you decide to try it . It works because it increases estrogen in the body . As with any natural product , you need to evaluate if this is a good thing for you to try or not . Increasing estrogen can be an issue for some women with other problems ( uterine , cysts , etc ) , so please do your research . Many of my supplements are from Nature 's Way , because they do n't often use stearates in their products , if avoidable . This brand is very pure , the ingredients in this are ( per two capsules ) fenugreek seed 1,220 mg , gelatin and silica . I do n't care for gelatin , so I just open the capsules and pour out the powder in a bit of water when I am ready to take them . The taste is like bitter maple syrup , but when you also open a fennel powder ( tastes of black licorice ) and mix in the water with it , its not so bad . I have heard some people say that it affects how they smell , this has just not been the case for me . I work out about an hour a day , and I sweat , and I have n't had the 'pancake syrup ' scent that some people mention . But , it does n't really sound like a bad thing !	1
I use Fenugreek to help with my milk production . I see a noticeable difference when I 'm taking it verses when I 'm not taking it . It 's best paired with Blessed Thistle for better results .	1
It could be me . When you hit middle age all sorts of strange things start to happen ... lol ! But , the taste just is n't as strong / flavorful as the first batch I bought about 2 1/2 years ago . If they changed the type / amount of tea or spices used in the recipe , then it 's not my imagination . If they did ( and we will likely never know ) , then I 'm not crazy . OK , I am , but the change in flavor is the reason for 4 instead of 5 stars.I used to love it ; now I like it a real lot.This tea *is* yummy and usually works better for me than `` Smooth Move . `` The next part of the review may be TMI ( Too Much Information ) for some . You can stop reading now if you 're uncomfortable talking about constipation . : - ) I know many people ( mostly woman ) who have been dealing with this issue for years . Many things affect your digestion system : Diet , exercise , stress , medication , the amount of water you drink , etc.Here are my tips / advice . ( I am not a medical doctor , nurse practitioner or even a Phd . If you are experiencing more than occasional constipation , you need to see a doctor . ) Do n't drink this tea all the time . It 's like taking any laxative too often ; it will stop being effective . Also , be sure to drink at least a glass of water after you finish the tea . More if you can.. I will sometimes drink half the tea and then let it sit overnight ( covered ) with the tea bag in it and finish the rest in the morning . If I 'm especially `` stuffed up '' I 'll use two tea bags.I use one Splenda packet to sweeten it . It 's pretty sweet on its own ; you may not need to add anything . Or a bit of honey is nice.The active ingredient is the herb `` senna . '' Just because it 's not a prescription medication , does n't mean it 's not powerful . In fact , there are prescription laxative medications that are based on senna.The first time you use the tea , I highly recommend trying it in the morning when you can spend the day relaxing and near a bathroom . Nothing worse than finding out in the middle of a date that this tea really works for you ! ( I 'm lucky ; my man of 16 years is so used to me and my `` issues '' I do n't have to be embarrassed . ) Eveyone 's system is different . There are many factors that impact its effectiveness as a laxative . Do n't be discouraged if it does n't work the first time or right away . It 's a trial and error process . For me , drinking half of it before bed and the other half upon waking ( with the tea bag ( s ) still in it ) often works by mid-morning.I microwave a 16 or 20 ounce mug of water for 3 1/2 minutes . Then , dump the bag ( s ) and the sweetener , if using , in the boiled water . Cover it with a plate and let it sit until it 's cool enough to drink ( about 10 minutes ) .Even if it works , it 's a good idea to clean yourself out completely every 1-3 months . Use `` Medline 1 EA/EA ENEMA BAG , W/SLIDE CLAMP , POLYBAG '' ( B0016LG9KMCheap and sanitary . I 've stopped buying the red rubber kits . If you use them , fill with very hot water and a teaspoon of bleach . Slosh it around , let it sit until cool , then rinse with hot water , allowing it to run through the tubing . Hang to dry before storing.Here is a great article on how to give yourself an enema ( I 've been doing this for years and I learned something new from it ) : [ ... ] I get that this stuff is kind of embarrassing and no one wants to talk about it . Please try to get past it because it 's important to your health . Hope this information was helpful.Would love to know what works / does n't work for others . You can leave a comment here . Thanks !	1
The tea is delicious , but I have n't experience the & # 34 ; runs & # 34 ; as mentioned by other reviewers -- even when I let it steep for a long period . I have , over a period of a week , found myself to be more regular . Overall , I like the product and will continue to use it to promote regularity . Maybe being more regular will get that scale moving downward again . : )	1
Mild taste and laxative effect , Good price for a package of 60 . I prefer to eat fiber but some days I do n't eat as healthfully as I should ...	1
This tea has a superb taste . I actually look forward to drinking this tea with my dinner . Now that it is summer I drink is as an iced tea , but this is also a very delicious hot drink too ! I use splenda and fresh mint when I brew it . Fabulous !	1
Good flavor , unique in all the teas that I 've tried.This tea is effective for cleansing one 's system , but is not as harsh as a regular laxative . It can be consumed daily or as needed	1
Have used this product for many years - but only as a way to & # 34 ; regulate & # 34 ; ... . My husband fights keeping his bowel movements regular daily - I just have a little cup of & # 34 ; diet tea & # 34 ; every evening - and & # 34 ; wallah & # 34 ; ! no problems here ... lol . I do not use it as a weight/diet program ; but for this reason , it works for me ... .	1
Sometimes this tea works as I tended other times it does n't . This may be because I have IBS , and the senna in tea sometimes upsets my stomach . You need to drink plenty of water though or it 's less effective .	1
I love this tea the taste is really good and it smells good as well my husband and I are year around tea drinkers and also we dont even have to add any sugar ( well I use honey on some teas ) but this one you do n't need anything extra and I will say it really does work drink plenty of water threw out the day ... . And usually in the am you will be cleaning it out lol ... I did n't have any stomach pains or anything but I eat well also ! ! I recommend this to any and everyone ! !	1
It helps with occasional constipation , which is why I purchased it . Tastes good . I would n't say it 's good for dieting purposes , but results may vary with different people .	1
I admit , I have n't been using this as religiously as I had hoped , but so far , I am quite happy with this product . The taste is very subtle , so if you like a stronger tea , you might want to add a small amount of sweetener . I would purchase this again !	1
This is far and away the best cinnamon tea I have ever found . It 's quite difficult to find a cinnamon tea without added flavors like apple . This is just cinnamon tea , and it 's aroma and taste is that of fresh cinnamon . Also I drink this after dinner to curb my carb cravings , and amazingly , it does the trick .	1
I plan to make broth in the next few days . It seemed to me that it would be a good idea to add a healthy gelatin to `` my creation '' .100 % Bovine Gelatin , 14 oz seems to be an excellent nutritional addition without adding on a `` guzzilion '' calories or salt . It matters very much to me that this product comes from grass fed cows . I do not remember the exact recipe now , but I did try this 100 % Bovine Gelatin by itself : .. added water and a cooled 1/2 cup of chamomile tea . The taste was mild and pleasant . It will neither overpower nor interfere with a recipe . ... just wanted to write a review to say that right out of the gate I know that this one is a `` keeper '' for me ! I would like to add an update after I have made my broth !	1
This gelatin gels up nicely . I also love that it is made from cows that are first tested that they are not sick .	1
This is a good gelatine with no flavor whatsoever , so it can be used to gel anything . I dissolve a tablespoon of gelatine in juice or tea daily because it helps my joints . But I also use it to make gelatine desserts , fortify soups and stews , and in aspics.This brand is n't as fine a gelatine as I 've had , but the quality is very good . I 've got no complaints .	1
Better tasting than Knox -- or any other gelatin they sell in the local grocery.I add a teaspoon to a bowl of bone broth . For some reason ( either due to overcooking or because of the type of bones I 'm able to get ) my bone broth does n't always gel -- which means the gelatin from the bones either got broken down during cooking or was n't there to start with . So I add Bernard Jensen 's gelatin to make up for the lack of gelatin in my broth.The bottle lasts me about a year .	1
I bought it to make jello with and it works really well . Will definitely buy again when I need more !	1
When you need to use gelatin at all you want to know that it is the real thing . I am very pleased with the smell and taste . Why buy any other product ? They can not compare .	1
I purchased this product on the recommendation of the Weston A . Price Foundation . So far I have no complaints , although I have n't yet had the `` this is so much better than Knox brand '' moment that several other posters have .	1
Followed a recipe left by another review and made some jello . It was really good . Planning to use this for making ice cream though . It 's a great quality product ! : )	1
Okay , so I am on a trial basis with several gelatin products at this time and several gelling agents that are NOT gelatins as well . My baseline product is Knox gelatin with which I am most familiar because I have been using it for years as it comes from the grocery . So far everything I have tried is MUCH better than Knox ! ! I decided to try this product for two reasons . First , because it is a powdered product much the same as Knox and would therefore be easy to compare . Second , because it is a bovine ( beef assumedly.. ? ? ) product that is differentiated from other gelatins that are pork based . I have also tried sheet gelatins ( pork.. ) which were excellent in all respects and some gel capsules which were of no consequence at all.My main usage for gelatin is nutritional in nature as a protein enhancement to diet and as a gelling agent for aspics and a thickener for other mostly liquid preparations . Knox gelatin always worked ... .but I wanted something that was cleaner and clearer , smelled better and was easy to use.This product comes nicely packaged and because it is in a bulk container can be easily measured in varying quantities ... something not easily done with Knox . When mixed according to directions , it forms a warm liquid that is clearer than Knox and has less odor . I am not certain about its gelling strength , mostly because I have n't directly compared it to Knox on that basis . I would need to weigh out the amounts used to properly determine that and then measure it by volume as well to eliminate possible inconsistencies with formulation and settling in packaging . I have n't taken the time to do that yet , although I probably will.So far I have n't found anything to dislike about this product . It meets all of my original criteria which I admit are largely subjective in nature , in that relative clearness , and odor are in the eyes of the user ... ..but I CAN see , smell , and taste the difference . Everything that makes me happy ! I will admit here that the sheet gelatins have become my favorites for a lot of different preparations . They are so clean and so easy to use . However , for those applications where you would use a powdered gelatin , small amounts , quick thickening or easy protein supplementation in a single serving size possibly ... ..this product will more than meet your needs . Easily measured and used and packaged to maintain freshness , this product is SO much better than similar grocery items ... .Try it ... I think you 'll like it ! !	1
This is a great Oolong tea product , one of my two favorites . It is even drinkable without adding anything to it . I mix it with either flavored tea , stevia or flavored stevia .	1
Unexcelled as to price and equal in quality to the best !	1
I 'm not a coffee drinker and Oolong is my favorite tea . This is my first box of & # 34 ; Prince of Peace Oolong Tea & # 34 ; and the tea has a good aroma and pleasant taste . Makes good ice tea too . I will buy this brand again . Bags are individually wraped in a paper envelope .	1
I started loving Oolong tea after I discovered a bottled product called 'Tejava ' . That product is over a dollar for a 12 ounce bottle . I needed something less expensive so I tried this 'Prince of Peace ' brand Oolong.After a few brewing experiments , I now love this stuff.What I have learned ; If brewing as 'sun tea ' this type of tea seems to come out very weak . If you put this tea in boiling water , it may come out bitter.I now heat up my water in a microwave until it is , very hot to the touch , but no way near boiling . I then put in the tea bags and let it brew for about twenty minutes ( I like strong tea ) . I have , to my taste , duplicated the 'Tejava ' brew at a fraction of the original cost.EnjoyKen	1
I drink three cups of this each day , made with one Oolong tea bag and one green tea bag , in a large mug . I believe this has helped me to lose about 8 lbs . in the last five months . I drink it without sweeteners , and also cold . The price for this is very reasonable , and the taste is mild .	1
I think we will be buying this again . There is a local man who made as good if not better honey but he has passed on as far as we know . We taste test honey often . I like it in my tea and my husband likes his on bread .	1
What can I say bad about this honey ? Nothing ! ! ! I even wonder if it 's just raw honey at all ! It is very thick , sweet , and creamy ! I only use it for tea but when I did my YouTube review I tasted it and boy why did I do that ? ? ? ? ? It is YUMMY ! ! Check out my YouTube review to get my full opinion and reaction ! [ ... ]	1
I take a spoonful in the am and pm . I 'm a hot sleeper and this regulates my metabolism wonderfully . Highly recommend this .	1
Best raw honey I 've ever had and has a great flavor . Will definitely buy this product again . Will put it with my other subscription and save items .	1
I have purchased this honey many times & have always been satisfiedwith the taste & texture.The company replaced a broken jar very quickly with one orderVery happy with the honey & the company	1
I used to buy & # 34 ; Really Raw & # 34 ; honey , but this brand is cheaper and tastes pretty much the same . I do n't use processed sugars anymore .	1
This is without a doubt the most amazing honey available . It is ultrasweet , smooth and glides on toast or anything else . I LOVE this stuff and be forewarned it can be addicting ! It 's that good ! I sometimes just take a small knife and dip it right out of the jar so I can savor it 's flavor . It 's definitely a winner !	1
This has to be the best tasting honey on the market in my humble opinion . Use it in my coffee and it melts right away . Gives the coffee a taste like none other . It comes in the hardened state but like I said with the coffee I use it in it melts easily . Or either put the jar in warm water to melt it .	1
This stuff is GOOD , and as another reviewer said you have to be careful because it is that tasty you can overdo ! It is REAL . ( Sadly these days counterfeit honey is a rampant problem - the raw stuff is hard to counterfeit , but rest assured this is an ethical supplier.The health benefits of raw honey are many as it 's a live food , full of enzymes , and acts as prebiotic ( containing substances that contribute to a healthier gut and flora in the entire body ) .It is hard to avoid completely all the processed , 'dead ' foods in the modern world , that do little more than add calories and contribute to disease , so adding things like this to our diet , can help a lot.I like it in tea , I put it in the cup first and then pour in the hot water and stir it.I especially love it in a broccoli salad I make - using chopped/grated broccoli stalks & carrots , organic raisins or dried cherries , and Vegenaise with a tablespoon of this honey -- it is DELICIOUS and a sweet tooth satisfier !	1
I use this product daily in my smoothie and have ordered in three times . Fresh made almond milk , cacao powder , honey , banana and amazing grass ... .love it . I will always look to order this honey !	1
I was honestly disappointed when I first tasted this honey . From reading the other reviews , I ordered it in anticipation of tasting something that I 've never tasted before , something unlike the flavor of any honey I grew up with . I wanted to finally understand why Winnie the Pooh goes bonkers for honey ... Unfortunately , while this is a good honey , it is basically a crystallized unprocessed honey with nice smoother creamed texture than typical aged granular honey . While it is marginally better than store-bought processed honey with flatter flavor and caramelized stronger aftertaste , it ultimately left me wondering `` What 's the big deal ? '' The Y.S . Organic raw honey is a product of Brazil & Canada , and it 's worth a try if you 've never tasted raw unfiltered honey before . However , I recommend that you lookout for fresh unprocessed honey from your local bee farmers instead , which may also help you ward off allergy symptoms to your local allergens . Those will taste more like the popular Honey Spoons candy ( sold at Cracker Barrel ) without the distinct complex flavor of aged crystallized honey which is what this honey ultimately tastes like . Many may prefer creamed aged honey , but I personally prefer the taste of fresh liquid raw honey .	1
So I wanted to run an experiment to see if spiking insulin levels after exercise induced muscle gain . Since sugar is not really healthy , I decided to use honey since it is purportedly full of healthy nutrients . As pasteurizing inactivates most of the nutrients , I chose organic and raw honey . It arrived in enough bubble wrap to protect the jar from a drop of at least 100 feet . Quite impressive . It took me a minute with a knife to get it all off . The honey itself was pretty hard on top but was softer about an eighth inch in . Taste was perfect . I spent half a day slowly heating it and it eventually became a viscous liquid but after 2 days it appears to be crystallizing again . It 's not that bad because I kind of liked the sensation of the honey melting in my mouth , slowly releasing the sweetness . I find that making a peanut butter and honey sandwich is as good to me as any dessert I have ever tried but much healthier . Overall , I am pleased with the honey .	1
The YS Organic Honey is simply delicious.I 've tried a handful of other organic honeys & this one is by far my favorite.The flavor is rich & creamy with a smooth , balanced & lingering aftertaste.Great for cooking because it does n't have the strong floral or citrus characteristics . that many honeys contain.I use it often & whenever possible !	1
Great stuff ! I love the taste and the health benefits of raw honey . A side advantage is less sticky mess . Very easy to spoon into your tea with no sticky drips ! Rather expensive , but a large container that should go a long way .	1
Great , on my third jar.Great taste.Havent had such good tasting honey in a long time.It always comes before they say	1
This is almost addicting . REAL HONEY is nothing like the grocery store kind . Amazing taste and of course , organic . I will be buying this again !	1
This is really great quality honey , and we 've bought several jars for not only us but also friends . The flavour is much better than any store bought honey than I can think of , and it 's thick enough that you could eat it like candy , though it melts superbly if you like the thinner store honey better.I would really love to see this company put out some honey comb , as I would LOVE to buy that too .	1
It was ... different . I am sp used to processed foods it actually tasted quite odd . I like it though , I used it for my homemade cinnamon-rolls yesterday and they came out so mouth-watering delicious . I also Used it in my hair this morning along with hot oil to condition my hair & my hair is sooooooo soft . I have very dry curly hair and it brought the bounce and shine back into my curls ! ! : ) NO COMPLAINTS ! !	1
Arrived in very good condition . Well packed and beautiful consistency . Ca n't wait to try it out but have other honey to use be for I open this one .	1
For the past 4 months I have been eating healthy . Everything from having no artificial sweeteners to recording every calorie and nutrient I eat . After doing hours of research I came to the conclusion all natural honey needed to be introduced to my diet . I was very impressed ! ! ! I typically make a fresh ground almond butter sandwich add bananas , and this honey and it tastes great ! Taste : AMAZINGPrice : Not bad , because it lasts a LONG LONG time . You wont use much at a time.Health : VERY GOOD FOR YOUOverall , I would but it again !	1
I have tried a lot of different honeys . I guess I would say I am a honey connoisseur . This honey is smooth and almost creamy . It is a bit pricey so I only use it for gourmet recipes and health care products but it works well . Good sturdy jar and it tastes pure and unprocessed .	1
The best tasting honey ever , period ! Love it , and will continue to buy it . : ) Will try to stock up when it 's on sale .	1
Very delicious and different from the store bought honey I 've been used to my whole life . It is solid but not crystalized in the way that store bought honey gets after awhile , more like a type of butter . It spreads easy and this is better I think because there is less of a mess than dealing with a liquid.They wrapped it 3x thick in bubble wrap , I guess from after all the responses of broken bottles lol .	1
Love this product . I used it during a upper respiratory infection ( URI ) and tea with this honey really helped me to kick it . Obviously , I did have antibiotics to assist but the fact is the normal time for URI to clear is about 2 weeks even with antibiotics . I kicked in one and did n't even have to worry about the chest sputum it cleared . I do believe that the combination of meds with the natural organic raw honey helped me to recuperate much quicker than normal.All this aside , it is great for teas and to take alone especially if sore throat or cough . I tastes great . Definitely recommend .	1
Currently comparing this with Manuka , and I really like this honey . It looks more like what I expect in a raw , unprocessed honey ; and I like that it is in a glass jar .	1
For years I used & # 34 ; the other stuff & # 34 ; . That is the kind of honey you can see thru . Then I read about being concerned regarding the country of origin of most mixed honey and decided to give Organic a try . Its a bit more work to use this , but the taste is wonderful . The pearly cream color and consistency makes this honey SO MUCH better than the other variety.You need to use a spoon , but its wonderful in the place of jelly on sandwiches . I like that this is from Canada and US sources.If you are considering trying Organic Honey .. give this a try . I thought 32oz would be too big of a jar but its alreadyhalf gone.Great price too .	1
This is definitely different ( even though the packaging looks similar ) to the other honey I have boughtY.S . Eco Bee Farms Raw Honey - 22 oz . This honey is a whole food and avoids all of the processes that are involved with making that other honey that is available on the grocers shelves.I love the raw ( spun ) kind of honey . The thickness and the taste of flowers ( you can get an idea of what types of flowers the bees visited ) give this particular brand a light , floral taste.My bottle had a crystallized layer at the top that was almost waxy . This added to the flavor and texture and was not a problem . As others have mentioned , this can be softened by placing the bottle in hot water . I find that this honey is great on my Udi 's GF bread as toastUdi 's Gluten Free Whole Grain Bread ( 1 Case ) . A spoonful of the honey is great for the throat and just feels good.Love it .	1
This is so much easier to spread on toast etc . and it does n't seem as sweet as regular honey . I do have a problem with the price as it is much more expensive than the more liquid honey . I bought 2 jars which will last a long time and probably wo n't buy more due to the cost . It really is good though .	1
I will buy nothing but raw honey . This brand is very good ! ! It is very difficult not to eat spoonful 's ! * I take a spoonful before bed and it actually helps me to sleep better . * Put honey on a cut and it WILL heal faster ! * GREAT for skin . Either water it down to be thinner to wash your face with or put honey on your face as a facial . Once the honey has set on your skin for about 10 minutes , press your fingers ( flattened hand ) against the honey and pull . Yes , sticky . Do this for several minutes all over your face . It helps to pull toxins out of your skin and stimulates blood flow . Your skin is left sparkling clean . * Raw honey has antibiotic properties which is why they say to put honey in warm water and sip . It helps coat the throat and reduce irritation . * For blocked sinuses , mix a teaspoon or so in a pot of hot water and then put the towel over your head and inhale the steam . Again , the antibiotic properties help with a sinus infection . * To treat allergies the honey should be local so the bees have made the honey from the local pollen . * A spoonful ( ok , a heaping spoonful ) in my coffee or tea gets a burst of energy.I love the texture , I love the taste . Absolutely night and day from processed honey .	1
I tried both ys organic bee farms raw honey . The certified organic and the other non certified version . This honey has good flavor but i find the texture is a bit too hard . This version comes in a glass jar . The other version comes in a plastic jar . The other version is a better texture and flavor in my opinion . The other version has a slightly more intense honey flavor at least over the processed kind . The 22 oz version is my pick between the two	1
Bought in Feb. used this last month , loved the product , is really raw honey and not whipped up and gel like . This stuff is incredible and tastes wonderful . Raw honey has so much more good stuff ... and the price has even dropped from Feb ! And , it is organic ... certified ! Just ordered 4 lbs again ! Thanks !	1
My honey arrived as shown in the photo , opaque . But it 's delicious , and really helped my stomach . I take it twice a day , and even with cinnamon . You might want to research how the combination of honey & cinnamon is good for you .	1
This honey has an excellent flavor , especially after i set it in warm tap water ( 100-110 degrees F ) for about an hour to get it real creamy . The sweetness is perfect , the creamy body is just right and it just has a downright nice & # 34 ; honey taste & # 34 ; .The creamy honey is far better than the raw , organic honey that can crystalize after sitting for a long while , which has a grainy texture I do n't care for .	1
I really like this honey and the flavor it adds to my teas . I will definitely purchase this product again .	1
I purchased three brands at the same time so I can taste to find out which on is best for me , so I have purchased this YS organic , stakich and canada white gold , Shipping : YS organic arrived fastest and I received in the third day while the other two a fulfilled by Amazon and that did not arrive until 8 days laterappearance , this YS brand is in very clean looking glass bottle while the other two in plastic and the stakich bottle do look a little messyTaste and texture : the YS brand is very smooth and less sweet than other two , the texture is very fine and butter like ( its just very good looking ) , stakich taste very average and the white gold taste real good with very creamy flavor , however it is too watery ( even though they claim it is very dry , but I liked it as it is easy to scoop and apply . one more thing about this white gold . they do not have a really valid contact information , if you search the website , they only have a temp site with a cell contact number , which is very bad ) personally , I liked the YS the best , however I would suggest the owner not to reply to negative feedback like they did here , it is ok for people to not like your product , and it is just not nice for other consumers to see how you repliedbtw , the honeys taste all depends on the types of honey and flowers and environment , but I will buy YS and White gold again	1
I had to find a sweetener replacement because agave syrup gave me carb-reactive hypoglycemia and blood sugar issues.This honey is - delectable.I use it : - for raw chocolate syrup - 1 part raw dark cocoa powder , 1 part raw coconut oil or cocoa butter , 1/2 part honey ( or to taste ) - for healing honey - warm water , a bit of lemon and 1/2 tsp of this honey a day for body-healing properties- for cinnamon toast - spread this plus sprinkled cinnamon over gluten-free breadAll in all , I will for SURE be a regular and buy this again when I run out.NOTE : the top of my honey looked white , maybe from oxidation on the top layer or moisture in the honey top layer . But it tasted Fine ! Yum yum !	1
I 've had a lot of different kinds of honey , and this is one of the best . The quality of taste is amazing . I use it in my teas all the time and take a teaspoonful for sore throat . My daughter has asthma and takes this with her breathe easy teas . Love it .	1
I like it . The price is good and the quality of the honey seems to be good for a raw organic honey .	1
This is the best honey we have ever had . It has the bees wax on top to seal the honey and to eat a scoop of the wax with the honey is so good . Love this stuff ! ! !	1
I LOVE THIS STUFF ! It seemed costly , but , I am so glad I tried it . It is a firm form of the tastiest honey I have ever had . I spoon it right out of the jar and into my mouth . If you need it to be softer you just warm it up . It 's not crystalized like when honey sits for too long . This is smooth and has a creamy feel in the mouth . It melts quickly in my tea and the smell is divine . Highly recommended !	1
Great product especially for vegans , great foe healing cuts and burns ? easy to store . Just keep out of heat and light no refrigeration requmired	1
Great value for the quality and price ! I 've had a lot of raw honey and this one is fabulous ! ! Well worth the purchase .	1
This is great honey - very nice flavor , very mild , great to use in baking , on rice cakes , in coffee or tea ... all around great organic honey ... I put the jar in the microwave to make it more runny , because it does n't come that way . If you are going to put in tea or coffee , or spread on rice cakes , its fine as it is - but need to make it runny if you are going to bake with it , so you can pour into a measuring cup ...	1
This is by far the best honey I have ever had ! I have many kinds , as I drink tea throughout the day . Not only does it taste good , but I do n't need as much of this as the soft honey . I am hoping that I ingest just a few less carbs this way as I have to have my white and green teas every day . I just ordered 2 more . It will not disappoint .	1
OMG , I can not say enough about this honey ! it is Sooo Goood ! I will never go back to buying from supermarket .	1
very easy to get out of jar , delicious in taste and priced right ! I like it thicker like this for easy spreading !	1
What can I say except & # 34 ; Great ! & # 34 ; ? Organic , tastes great , helps with my food digestion and restoring flora . I love it .	1
I love honey , and this is no exception . The flavor is good , with a mellowness that highlights the organic nature of the product . The honey is thick and fairly hard in the jar , but melts rapidly in tea or on toast .	1
YS Organic Bee Farms CERTIFIED ORGANIC RAW HONEY 100 % CERTIFIED ORGANIC ... Ordered a jar of this to try ..it was so good I ordered the 2 pack ..Will be ordering it again ... Much better than the store junk ..and priced reasonable ... I use it in my coffee and with Bragg Apple Cider Vinegar Organic Raw for a salad dressing ..add some poppy seed and olive oil and it 's a great dressing !	1
I really ca n't get enough of this stuff.It 's not golden and runny like most honeys are . It 's more solid , though still spreadable , and no where near as sweet as honey.Most honey has high fructose corn syrup in it which makes it too sweet.This is perfect ... still sweet but does n't over power the `` honey taste '' I put a tablespoon in a couple of hot green tea every morning ... NOM NOM NOM ! Try it ... you 'll tank me later !	1
I call this happiness in a jar.Okay it 's not 100 % raw like from a honeycomb , but its not bad either . Also , raw honey is a much better alternative than 'healthier processed ' sweeteners like xylitol and stevia .	1
I still have n't figured out what makes this honey the color and consistency that it is.. I buy local honey but wanted to try this.. I love the flavor and fact that it 's not filtered in any way.. Do n't think it has quite the taste as my local raw honey though.. May purchase again..	1
Love this honey . Will only buy raw honey now . Has a distinct flavor and use it for tea and coffee mostly . But tastes good on just about anything .	1
YS Organic Bee Farms CERTIFIED ORGANIC RAW HONEY 100 % CERTIFIED ORGANIC HONEY Raw , Unprocessed , Unpasteurized - Kosher 32ozWe are thrilled to recommend this product and this seller . We get our orders early and the packing is superb.The product is exactly as described on Amazon 's web site , and it is totally delicious . After reading the detailed description , we knew this was for us .	1
There is double the taste when you get the organic honey . I ate one pound in a month just in my coffees . Very cheap if you look around .	1
I enjoy honey in my morning tea , and the local health food store had run out so I bought this . It was more firm than the honey I typically get , but still very flavorful and does the job to sweeten the tea ! I just like the taste and consistency of local raw honey better I guess ?	1
This Honey is awesome . I have been using it for about 2 years as of this post . It is sweet and satisfying . You dont need to use very much and then your craving is filled . I am not a doctor but I have heard from reliable sources that unfiltered raw Honey helps reduce seasonal allergies due to yourbody getting some of the pollen that the bees have on them and then they put it in the honey . That pollen in the honey is like a healthy way to train your body how to fight the pollen . I have been doing many things to be more healthy in in the last 8 years but I can confidently say that I have not had any allery responses in more that 2 years . Even the year before I used this honey I had almost no allergies due to being more healthy , Now I have not had ANY allergy response for 2 or mroe years .	1
LOVE this honey and it 's amazing with tea . I heard it loses it 's benefits when heated but it 's so damn good in tea I just ca n't help myself . Besides in tea it 's a great tasting honey . Texture is firm and not runny like the processed ones in stores . Surprisingly it tastes way better than the runny crap in stores too !	1
This is a very delicious , pure , true raw USDA organic honey.REAL HONEY : Raw honey is expensive . USDA organic honey is more expensive than just even organic honey without the stamp of USDA . To combine RAW and USDA organic and add qualities like Only 100 % pure raw , unpasteurized , unfiltered , undiluted , untreated , unprocessed , no HFCS , not adulterate , not blended with other items such as corn syrup and rice syrup , makes it the true honey not glucose tasting like honey . For that reason that superior product , that superior superfood never sells in big buckets , or hardly ever in any container over 16 oz jar.FILTERING : At country 's top honey packers , Dutch Gold , in Lancaster , PA , raw honey gets pumped through layers of white filters . Before the honey hit the filters , a powdered sedimentary rock called diatomaceous earth is added . This is a standard , widely used process . It removes all the pollen , along with dust , bees ' wings , and , of course , the diatomaceous earth.ORGANIC HONEY : Organic honey does n't go through nearly as fine a filter since organic rules prohibit the use of diatomaceous earth in the filtering process but regardless it is not a raw honey just because organic.VARIETY : Weather , location , flower type and season impact the coloring , taste and viscosity of honey produced by bees . Honey by the cost will hardly even crystallize . Tupelo sold by YS is raw although runny and pourable which will not crystallize due to its high moisture content . If from outside of US then Fair Trade stamp has some assurances of fair treatment of workers although not true in every case.CHINESE HONEY : Chinese honey famous for `` ultrapurified , '' a technique that can involve diluting honey with extra water , running it through extremely fine filters , and then removing the water . The process filters out much more and produces a sweet substance that is no longer honey . The process removes any pollens and the possibility of identifying the source of honey . Chinese honey is barred from the U.S. not because it 's unsafe , but because U.S. officials decided it was too cheap . Chinese honey has had more than its share of safety problems . But there 's also plenty of perfectly good Chinese honey for sale on the world market . EU is fussier about honey quality than the US , yet EU imports lots of honey from China but not US.QUALITY : A honey is only as good as the producer and regardless of all marketing and claims by sellers , there is no assurance that a jar of honey is full of pollen , unheated or unfiltered at 100 degree instead of 130 degree . Even if the honey was heated only to 90 degree at the time of production , the honey jar could be sitting in a storage or while being transported in containers that the temperatures can easily exceed 100 degrees . The only assurance that I have is purchasing honey from a producer with high quality reputation and a seller with high turnover . Wedderspoon brand and New Zealand are on top of my list . Purchasing Wedderspoon directly from Wedderspoon or authorized distributor is the only assurance I have for proper storage , pollen and enzymes that honey is consumed for.USES : I consume honey not by labeling but by the amount of pollen it carries . Only 100 % pure raw , unpasteurized , unfiltered , undiluted , untreated , unprocessed , no HFCS , not adulterate , not blended with other items such as corn syrup and rice syrup from only trusted brands . I consume honey all the time since it has many nutritional benefits for me . I consume after any meal since it helps digestion . I used to consume chocolate years ago but I do not anymore since I consume pure cocoa which I add to my power drinks . I am into many sports and quality honey is the best quick energy I can get to boost my immune system and give myself a healthy rush of energy when I am in middle of my mountain biking , hiking , backpacking , surfing , etc . I drink lots of tea and I never use honey instead I use molasses . Molasses does not lose its nutritional value when heated but any heat to raw honey kills the quality enzymes and pollen in honey so I only consume honey straight out of the jar with spoon in moderation due to its high calories . Honey is the best ointment for all my scabs in mountain biking trails . After a day when my wounds are sealed I place raw honey for rejuvenation and it is the best healer of all instead of using Neosporin which loosens the scab and removes the scab , leaving scars on my skin . Bravo .	1
No complaints about this honey . My boys and I love it . Much better than the processed honey I used to buy at the store . I just wish they offered free shipping !	1
It look high quality product . The consistency and taste are perfect , and the glass container add better conservation . Thanks a lot .	1
this stuff is the best honey ever . Unprocessed honey is the only way to go , buy this stuff its great !	1
Amazon , put this on subscribe and save please ! Great Taste , thick honey , but easy to get out of the jar ! Good for making a honey spicy brown mustard dressing !	1
Wow , well do I start . I guess all I can really say is that I 'm in love this honey . Also , I was actually surprised by the size when I got it . I did n't exepct to get so much due to the reasonable price . I will be reordering again so that I have jars in my cabinet LOL . I do n't want to run out . By the way , it makes even the most bitter of coffees taste amazingly sweet and delicious .	1
This is the best tasting honey I 've ever had . After checking prices at several local and not so local stores I also consider it a great value . I will say though that we 've started buying 2 of the smaller 22 oz . jars each order instead of 1 larger 32 oz . jar . Including the 99 cents each jar shipping , it comes out a little cheaper per oz . Not sure why the 22 oz . jar description calls it `` gel '' . It 's the same solid honey as you get in the 32 oz solid.If you 're looking for really good organic natural raw honey this is the best deal around .	1
Best tasting and sweetest honey . Much better than wildflower honey . It 's quite thick but I do n't see that as a drawback . It 's delicious in recipes and you do n't need a lot to sweeten .	1
PURE , UNPASTEURIZED , UNFILTERED , ORGANIC , KOSHER , RAW HONEYLove it , love it , love it.I rarely recommend buying something that 's more expensive than any `` regular '' type , but organic is well worth it as far as I 'm concerned . Any time you can afford organic I believe it 's worth the extra money because it 's all about your health , not just taste . Everything you eat affects your health . You either pay extra now for the good stuff , or you pay a lot more later in the way of doctor bills and possibly even an early death.I get raw ( unheated , never heat treated ) honey from a friend now and then , she has her own hives , and Y.S . Organic honey is just as good if not better . Do n't tell her , but I think this may be better than hers because her raw honey is not certified organic and kosher . Who knows where her bees have been . ; ) I know honey can taste different depending on what flowers the bees pollinate , and I 'm not sure what kind of honey this is ( what kind of flowers ) but the flavor is just right . Not too mild , not too strong , not too sweet . I know I sound like Goldie Locks , but it 's just right.With honey bees rapidly disappearing from the world ( scientists do n't know why ) I like the idea of organic hives - making sure chemicals are not spread around that may harm the bees as well as the people who eat their honey.One word of caution though , when you shop for this honey . If you do n't read the label carefully you might buy one that is not organic . Y.S . Bee Farms makes both organic and not organic , and they are both raw and unpasteurized . I uploaded photos to show you the two different bottles ( see above ) . Organic is in glass jars , and more expensive . Non-organic is in plastic jars and a little less money . But if you do n't look closely you may think the non-organic is organic because the name of the company is `` Y.S . Organic Bee Farms '' , and that name is on all jars , organic or not . To make sure your honey , or any food item , is truly organic , make sure it has the certified organic seal , as this product does.~ ~ ~What you should know about raw honey vs. pasteurized honey : Raw honey is the concentrated nectar of flowers gathered by bees ( naturally , that 's what they do ) that comes straight from the bee hive ( through an extracting process in a controlled setting ) . Raw honey is unheated , pure , unpasteurized , and unprocessed . Raw honey is the healthiest choice amongst the various forms of honey as it has the most nutritional value and contains amylase , an enzyme concentrated in flower pollen which helps predigest starchy foods like breads . Raw honey often has a thick yellow look to it , almost like yellow wax , when at cooler room temperatures . If the room is warmer it may turn a more golden color and look like a very thick syrup.Honey is an alkaline-forming food , which means raw honey contains ingredients similar to those found in fruits , which become alkaline in the digestive system . It does n't ferment in the stomach and it can be used to counteract acid indigestion . When mixed with ginger and lemon juices , it also relieves nausea and supplies energy.Most of the honey found in the supermarket is not raw . You can usually tell the difference by looking at it , when it 's not raw it usually looks like a thick amber liquid you can almost see through , like a light colored thin syrup . This is because it has been processed and pasteurized ( heated at 70 degrees Celsius or more , followed by rapid cooling ) and filtered so that it looks cleaner and smoother , more appealing on the shelf , and easier to handle and package because it 's not as thick as raw honey.Pasteurization kills any yeast cell in the honey and prevents fermentation . It also slows down the speed of crystallization in liquid honey and that 's why it looks `` cleaner '' and smoother . But , when honey is heated and pasteurized its delicate aromas , yeast and enzymes ( that are responsible for activating vitamins and minerals in the body system ) are partially destroyed . For this reason raw honey is assumed to be more nutritious than honey that has undergone heat treatment.CAUTION : Bee products may cause allergic reactions in some people . Honey is not recommended for children under two .	1
A tasty , healthy spread : Combine 1/2 cup of YS Organic Honey with 1/3 cup extra virgin coconut oil* ( add a teaspoon of organic lemon oil or orange oil for fruit flavoring if desired ) . Both honey and coconut oil should be cool but not cold for easiest mixing . * Try Garden of Life Extra Virgin Coconut Oil ( sold in glass jars ) .	1
Raw honey is the only honey I buy . You just ca n't say enoug good things about it.Besides being used as a sweetner , raw honey has lot of other health benegits too.You can use raw honey for first aid to treat cuts and burns and raw honey is a staple in any pantyespecially if you are preparing for challenging times . I just ca n't seem to keep senoug on hand .	1
I have been used to consuming honey which is sparkling in nature . Most of honey we get in supermarkets is not raw honey but which has been pasteurized ( heated at 70 degrees Celsius or more , followed by rapid cooling ) for easy filtering and bottling so that it looks cleaner and smoother , more appealing on the shelf . When I looked at raw honey I could not believe why it looked like this . But the taste is awesome , and I have been reading up reviews here as well as online on health benefits of raw homey . I drink with warm water in morning or in raw spoonful . My grandparents had beehives , but I do n't remember now how it looked over 35 years ago ! This looks thick , but once you taste it you are hooked .	1
Wonderful ! Just what I needed . Even better than the last brand . The large jar will last a long time . Thank you , YS Organic Bee Farms !	1
This honey is certified organic and raw ( important if you want the health benefits ) . The taste is lovely - so good I ate it directly out of the jar .	1
this is a fine-tasting , long-lasting non-drippy food . there is a variety of sizes available . and it 's organic . what more could we want ?	1
I mostly used it in my morning smoothies not too sweet keep us sneeze free and easy to spoon out .	1
This is the best tasting honey I 've had since I was a kid . Raw honey has anti-viral , anti-bacterial , and anti-fungal properties . It promotes body and digestive health , is a powerful antioxidant , strengthens the immune system , eliminates allergies , and is an excellent remedy for skin wounds and all types of infections . Raw honey 's benefits do n't stop there . Raw honey can also stabilize blood pressure , balance sugar levels , relieve pain , calm nerves , and it has been used to treat ulcers . Raw honey is also an expectorant and anti-inflammatory and has been known to effectively treat respiratory conditions such as bronchitis and asthma.GO ORGANIC !	1
Wanted to thank for such a great product ! It 's absolutely delicious ! Its consistency and taste proves that it has not been processed or diluted with sugar and water . If you compare it with processed honey that is sold in stores you would actually feel there is a raw taste to this brand . Processed honey has syrup-like taste and it stays liquid for a long time . If you are looking for raw honey , you have to know that it changes its color and consistency over time.I have also noticed that no matter how much you can eat it , this honey does not make your stomach upset unlike processed store brands.In order for honey to be beneficial it has to be raw ! There is no way it can deliver all its goodness to you if it 's been processed ! Honey is a wonder food ! It has been scientifically proven to help heal wounds as it has antibacterial properties ; to help restore healthy intestinal flora as it is a prebiotic ; help recover from illnesses faster ; help you sleep better ; restore your nervous system after stressful events ( try a cup of herbal tea with raw honey after a stressful day ! ) and even make your skin contain moisture . Raw unprocessed honey does not make your sugar spike if you are diabetic . But it absolutely has to be raw ! If you buy processed honey you just waste your money , you can as well just buy some high fructose corn syrup ... .Thank you for selling your honey raw ! I wish one day people will be educated enough to avoid processed foods .	1
Great Product ! ! !	1
Thank God the honey bees are still around . The chemical companies want them all dead . This bee product is very , very good , I have been buying their product for many years . If they could only talk !	1
This is an excellent product . The honey is smooth and tasty and if there is a drawback it is that the honey is solid - not crystallized but more like smooth butter . I really did n't mind so for me it was everything I was looking for . The price was reasonable the packaging adequate and delivered on time .	1
I love this product . It is rich tasting , and full of healthy goodness . It is USDA Certified Organic so you do n't have to worry about pesticide contamination or any of the nasty HFC ( High Fructose Corn Syrup } that most other 'honey ' is polluted with . This is pure raw honey with all the goodness you would expect from a great natural product . I use it to sweeten my coffee/tea , put on toast or bagels , sweeten oat meal ... etc . etc . It might just be the worlds most perfect food .	1
It 's addictive ! ! ! One little bit on anything will get you hooked ! This bears norelationship to processed honey at all and is actually solid at room temperature.Not to worry , though . If you want it in liquid form , just heat it slightly in the nukeoven . It is absolutely the best tasting honey I have ever had .	1
I had not recently tried organic raw honey so I was not sure what to expect , regardless , I did not expect this . The taste is unbelievable , sweet yet not cloying- nothing else tastes quite like it . The texture is also a nice surprise in that it 's slightly creamy but with more body and texture than a typical processed spread like Nutella.Take a piece of high quality dense bread like Ezekiel bread , lightly toast it to bring out the nuttiness , then liberally apply a swab of raw honey to make a little piece of heaven on earth- delicious !	1
I have never been a fan of brown honey , but this honey is awesome . The taste and texture is worlds apart from regular brown honey . It 's also very nutritious . Who knew honey is also a prebiotic ! This is the only honey I will buy now . Highly recommend !	1
It has a very light , delicate taste and goes wonderfully in most drinks . It does not go with everything , of course , but as far as honeys go this is a very solid all-around performer , right up there with fireweed , orange blossom , acacia , and southwest desert wildflower .	1
I 've always had that liquid , gooey golden brown honey , even fresh off the combs from a friend whose relatives did beekeeping . This however , is by far the best I 've had . It 's slightly floral and to me a tiny bit of spice . It 's great in sweetening desserts too .	1
I really liked the taste and texture of this stuff . I 'll order more soon . It 's much better tasting than regular old store bought honey .	1
This tiny jar of concentrated yeast extract is quite the breakfast food . To use Marmite , spread it thinly on toast or sandwich bread . Wait ! What do you mean by `` thinly ? '' I mean , practically thin enough to be a monolayer of molecules , because if you spread it any thicker , it will taste pretty strong . Well , actually , I use a quarter of a teaspoon on each piece of toast , which is buttered first to lubricate the process . And wait , how would one spread it thinly on fresh , untoasted AMERICAN bread without it tearing the fluffy crumb into tiny balls only suitable for feeding the koi ? Again , a bit of softened butter , then a schmear of Marmite , a slice of tomato and you have a super tea sandwich . This is often my dinner , when I want something light.How and why was Marmite invented , and how did it become a beloved British traditional food , right up there with hedgehog-flavoured potato crisps ? Back in 1902 , some genius took the lees of good old British Ale , that is to say , Brewer 's Yeast , and boiled it down to a tarry , black substance that no one in their right mind would eat unless their Mum forced them to . Because of the B-complex , Marmite became popular as a supplement for prisoners-of-war , served in hospitals , schools , to troops in WWI and WWII . It almost was rationed in WWII , with mothers told to spread it `` very thinly , for now . `` Traditionally , Marmite is served on sandwiches and especially on toast at breakfast on toast `` soldiers '' or triangles of toast that kids can dip into their boiled eggs . The flavor is meaty , salty , though it has less salt than the butter you might use with it , and it has no meat or animal product -- it 's made of yeast so is vegetarian-vegan.The flavor , frankly , takes some getting used to if you do n't like strong , savory things . However , if you like savory , meaty flavors and want something non-sugary sweet on your breakfast toast , Marmite is fantastic . The closest I can describe the flavor is on the order of soy sauce , beef bouillion or mushroom pate . Other uses for Marmite are to flavor soups , meat or vegetable loaves , and stews , as a mix in dips or on bread for sandwiches and canapes.4 grams or about 1/8 ounce of Marmite has the following B vitamins : Riboflavin 0.28mg ( 17.5 % RDA ) Niacin 5.4mg ( 35.6 % RDA ) Folic Acid 100ug ( 50.0 % RDA ) Vitamin B12 0.5ug ( 60.0 % RDA )	1
I was first given this treat on a trip through England when the B & B ; owner offered me some for my breakfast . She had a sly grin on her face , and now I know she was expecting me to react like most Yanks do , but she and I were both surprised . A tiny dab of this stuff on the corner of a piece of toast was sheer heaven to me . I felt a sense of wellbeing spreading from my mouth throughout my body . I know that sounds a bit extreme , but that 's really how it felt ! All my life I 've craved savory flavors and have been drawn to foods such as red meat ( preferably scorched on the outside ) , tomatoes , mushrooms , and dark green vegetables - I 'll take one saltine cracker over a handful of cookies any day of the week . Well , come to find out , Marmite is high in the `` fifth flavor '' umami , and that 's what I 'm always trying to find in my food . It 's `` that flavor I 'm looking for '' distilled down into a little brown jar . Mind you , it 's strong stuff ; a little dab will satisfy all your red meat cravings ( though it contains not one spec of any animal product ) but more than a dab is really just 'way too strong , even for a savory-food-lover like me . Spread it THIN ! It 's great spread nearly transparently over toast or crackers , and a couple of drops will make any insipid canned broth lot more hearty.Caution : if you own a cat , make sure to wash your hands after eating Marmite . Apparently they go for it , too , and will try very enthusiastically to remove your fingers and run away with them if any trace is remaining on your hands !	1
I went to UK for the first time a couple of years back . My friends introduced me to Marmite as something some people enjoyed when they could n't afford eggs and bacon . The Mr said it was made from a by-product of beer , I thought he was joking at first . Spread it thinly on a piece of dry toast , served properly , he demonstrated then handed to me . It was surprisingly strong but I liked it . Savory [ or savoury as they would spell it ] like bacon or other cooked meats but none of the awful fat or grease . It 's not terribly hard to find here since the advent of shopping with the wonderful world wide web , so I have been able to enjoy this in the US as a snack between meals on one slice of whole wheat bread , often a late night sandwich with room temperature cheese and tomato .	1
Having lived in the US all of my life ( although I have traveled quite a bit ) I had never heard of Marmite until last week . I 've been participating in an on-line , UK based think-tank dealing with international brands and digital advertising . As we discussed products that we grew up with and are still loyal to Marmite came up several times . I looked at some Marmite ads ( the British call them `` adverts '' ) , and then searched for it on Amazon . Being a dedicated foodie I decided to give it a shot . Here is my impression : When I first opened the glass jar and gave it a whiff it seemed oddly familiar . I put just a dab on my spoon and tasted it straight . Again , strangely familiar . The taste was very strong , almost condensed . I could taste the beer-like yeast but I was also getting a savory , deep vegetable flavor . Then it hit me.I love to make sauces and I often use pre-made glaces and demi-glaces which have a very thick consistency when gently heated ( before heating they are almost solid ) . They come in many different varieties : beef ; duck ; veal ; chicken ; lamb ; seafood ; mushroom ; vegetable ; etc . Marmite has a strong resemblance to a straight , undiluted , vegetable glace . Pungent , earthy and with that quality that the Japanese refer to as `` Umami '' . WOW ! Who knew ? Well , I guess a lot of people did but it was new to me . Now , what to do with it ... My on-line British friends gave me some sage advice : use it sparingly and on some sort of bread with butter . I bought some fresh English Muffin bread from a local artisan bakery shop , lightly toasted it , coated it thinly with about 2/3 teaspoon of Marmite and spread some salted Vermont cultured butter onto it . HEAVEN ! The Marmite balanced out the heaviness of the butter perfectly . That gave me the inspiration for my next test . I 've alway loved a toasted bagel with cream cheese or Marscapone but need something to cut the palate-coating fat of the cheese besides a slice of onion ( lox works well if you have it ) . Marmite fit the bill technically , but I think that I will have to get used to the combination . Still , I will keep using it here for a while and I think that it might become a favorite for me.Next I tried it in a simple sauce . I browned a tablespoon of finely chopped shallots in 1 tablespoon of unsalted butter ( who am I kidding ? I used 2 tablespoons of butter ) . After the shallots were browned I added 3 tablespoons of Marite and 1 teaspoon of water . I reduced it a little and added 1/3 cup of heavy cream , a small bouquet garnet in cheesecloth and 1 tablespoon of dry sherry . I reduced it by about half and adjusted the strength by adding more Marmite ( I needed more , maybe I should have used less cream ) . When finished it tasted really good , not great but it could certainly WOW most people . Put this on fish , chicken , turkey , or any light meat or veggie and it works.Marmite has an advertising campaign that tells people that they will either love it or hate it . I am definitely in the love camp.More Than Gourmet Classic Roastd Vegetable Demi-Glace , 1.5-Ounces ( Pack of 6 ) More Than Gourmet Veggie-stock Gold ; Vegetable Stock , 16-Ounce Packages	1
Besides being sweet , does sugar -- from sugar cane -- have a flavor ? It does ! And when the sugar boils down into syrup , the flavor comes out . So , okay -- it IS sugar . Politically incorrect . Empty calories ... . I know , I know . But whether you take your sugar `` naturally '' in fruit or honey or `` unnaturally '' in hiprocessed candies and sugar-coated cereals , the chemical is the same ... .And the thing is not to get too much . And if I 'm going to have a certain amount ANYway , there are days when this is how I want to eat it . Ly'les Golden Syrup is a nice flavor alternative to honey , or maple syrup . The texture is thick like honey , but the flavor is light . It has much more `` depth '' and thickness than corn syrup . If you like crisp , Belgian waffles , this is great on them -- with or without pats of melted butter . My grandma used to use this more than 50 years ago and I started loving it as a kid . She put it in frostings and who knows what else . But I just like it as it is ... dip your fingers in and lick them off . Ummmmmmmm ... . So why ca n't you get this stuff in your local supermarket ? I ca n't find it anywhere ... . It 's because most people do n't know about it . And do n't know to ask for it , or how or where to get it . I 've never seen an ad for this , and it is n't manufactured by one of the megafoodgiant monopolies in the U.S. , but it is worth having . I just wish I did n't have to order it in sufficient quantities to justify the shipping charge . Kind of silly to pay $ 7 to have a $ 4 item shipped . So then you buy several ... but who has room to store several ? And it takes a long time to go through one can of it . LIke , a year . So , if I get three cans , I have enough for three years . Still , it 's worth the shipping to get two cans ... I want some right now . Too bad I have to wait .	1
Again , this is a favorite food stemming back to my husband 's childhood in England . I have used it in an old World War I recipe for an eggless fruit cake , and to top very small portions of Spotted Dick , as the dessert with syrup is very rich , though delicious .	1
Being terribly blunt , golden Syrup is made from cane sugar , like molasses and treacle but unlike them it is light , sweet and wonderful to eat.you can use it like honey but it is slightly thicker and has a sutbly different flavor that i prefer to honey.It can be used in sauces , as a glaze , soaked in breadcrumbs to make a tart , spread on bread for a sandwich or on top of waffles as a covering or ... well you get the idea . This is great stuff . a taste from my childhood spread on buttered bread.My only reservation is the price here is a bit dear . I 've seen it in specialty stores and even some better grocery stores for about $ 5 so you may want to look around a bit-but it will be sooo worth it !	1
I have friends in Australia and New Zealand and this is in many of their desserts , in fact they swear by it . The tin is pretty and the syrup is yummy . It almost has a burnt caramel flavor to it . We made ANZAC biscuits and they were very good ! I 've also heard it 's good drizzled over vanilla ice cream , but have n't tried that yet .	1
There is no American equivalent ; but I would really recommend you try this where you would use either honey or molasses . It is thicker and sweeter than honey , but not as thick or dark as molasses ... .be adventurous with oatmeal , pancakes etc ; you will be glad you did !	1
Many uses . Whenever I see a recipe for corn syrup I substitute for this and it works . It has more flavor than corn syrup - better .	1
Just the same as the bottles just in a can it is easier to store in a pantry but for ease of use I 'll go with the plastic bottles..	1
This product is delicious . It has a very unique taste and is great by itself or in other things like baked goods . It has a beautiful orange-gold color . I also use it in some beer recipes that I brew . The can is also lovely , but once I open it , I store the syrup in a glass jar .	1
I was tempted to give this fewer stars , but it would n't be fair to blame the product for Amazon 's poor packaging . Lyle 's Golden Syrup is an outstanding and delicious syrup . If you make any kind of traditional English desserts , there is no substitute . If you simply use it in place of corn syrup , you 'll never be satisfied with anything else again . I can only say : taste it . It speaks for itself , and it 's immediately obvious that this is n't just something you use to add sweetness . It has a distinctive and delicious flavor all its own and will enhance any recipe where it can be used . Or , just dribble it with butter on muffins or toast . Divine ! Now , as for Amazon 's packaging : terrible ! This product comes in a sturdy tin that could probably be stepped on by an elephant without being harmed , and yet Amazon packed it so poorly that it arrived half caved in and pretty useless . Because it 's a small and not expensive item , I wo n't go to the trouble of returning it - but I 'll find another source to buy it rather than Amazon . This is carried by many specialty stores and health food stores .	1
I love this tea . It has a nice robust flavor that others seem to lack . I have tried other Rooibos teas and this is hands down my favorite .	1
I 'm so impressed with the claims that are made for Rooibos Tea . If one is drinking green or black tea ( which is actual tea , not to be confused with an infusion such as Rooibos ) , then this product should be considered to be plugged into your daily routine . Does it work ? Are the alleged health benefits true ? Check back with me in 30 years . Meanwhile , enjoy a unique flavor and take care of yourselves .	1
In the '70s there was an herbal tea that I really loved from South Africa , but then came the boycott of South African goods and I could never again find it . Recently I did some research and found that the tea was once again available ( though not by the brand name I knew ) by the actual name of the tea `` Rooibos '' .So I made an order through Amazon ... and although the shipping price is a bit high for something so light in weight , I ca n't complain because the tea is even better than I remember it . For those who are n't familiar with Rooibos Tea , it is very similar to good Black tea in flavor , minus the bitter after taste and minus the caffeine and tannic acid , but with the anti-oxidants and other GOOD stuff . Refreshing and delicious stuff !	1
I drink rooibos tea when I want the flavor of tea without the caffeine of regular tea . A cup while watching nighttime TV wo n't keep me awake for hours like regular tea does . I like it in the single-serving packs so I do n't get the flotsam from making it with a strainer . Although , really , I do n't object to tea flotsam if it does n't get between my teeth , since rooibos can have sharp little splinter-like bits , the bag is a real convenience .	1
I enjoy this tea . Good value and was satisfied with the quick delivery . I have enjoyed at least one cup every day since receiving . I really enjoy the flavor .	1
I first started drinking Rooibois Tea in Zimbabwe in the 1980 's and amazing enough , it was Freshpak there also . This tea is even better for you then Green Tea and it is caffiene free . It taste very much like the regular orange and black pekoe tea . I love it and recommend it to any one . It was shipped immediately and that made me happy .	1
The iced tea maker runs all summer long and this is the tea of choice for the family : ten bags make a solid , tasty brew . I wish it came in the larger box -- the ones friends bring from South Africa !	1
Ugh , I feel like an idiot saying this , but I saw a magazine cover claiming you could lose weight with iced tea . I already drink iced tea a lot , so I wanted to see how I could use that to my advantage . This was actually my third pu erh tea and was the better of three . The bags were substantial and held together really well during brewing . You might have read how many folks do n't like the taste of puerh , that it tastes like dirt , well , ya , I can see that , but of the brands I 've tried this one tasted a lot less like dirt . Honestly , I do n't think pu erh tastes a whole lot more dirt like than cheap oolong . Anyway . So , for weight loss , well ... . OK , the article I read says two cups with or just after each meal and a cup of green tea between meal . I did not use this way , just ca n't fit that much in time wise what with brewing and all . I made sun tea , 32 ounces of water in a glass bottle with three pu erh bags and one green chai ( chai is my favorite tea of all time ) . When done I 'd put two packs of stevia in the raw in and I was good to go . I 'd have one cup with each meal when home . I found that as long as I was not bad about my eating this regimen would result in a tiny bit of weight loss , a few pounds , but I just could n't keep it going , eating out and stuff . If I was bad with eating then drinking this tea kept me from gaining . I can only imagine if I really followed what the article said or if I could just keep drinking it three time every day then real weight loss could happen . My current weight is quite troublesome as it is hormonal ( perimenopause ) and does n't respond to much , even exercise . To see what little I did see with this tea gives me hope . I do plan to try hitting it again and try to stick with it regularly enough to affect my weight for real . In summary , of the two pu erh teas I 've tried this one was definitely better tasting and higher quality , so if you are shopping for which brand I do recommend this brand . If you are looking for a recommendation for weight loss , then I think I can say yes , pu erh can help you lose weight , but you have to drink enough of it regularly enough and paired with green tea to get it to work . If you are looking for a healthy tea , then look no further , pu erh is higher in polyphenols than any other tea , and based on my latest cholesterol tests it really does help keep that down too .	1
Love this tea . I start off each morning with a hot cup of Pu-Erh and then have another cup with breakfast . All it needs is a packet of Spenda , but I also brew it with a sprig of fresh mint . Delicious ! !	1
Read some reviews that said this tea could taste strong and earthy , but Generation Pu-erh tea was surprisingly nice , much nicer than green tea . I 'm very happy with this product.And the service was exceptional , shipping incredibly FAST ! Thanks !	1
Helps to lose weight , but only if you take 1 hr . after your meal . If Dr. OZ recommended it , it must work , right ?	1
Is this cheap , `` Heck , no . `` Is this good , `` Yes ! `` Pu-erhs ( ooo-air ) are made into little ( or big ) cakes of tea , and then allowed to ferment ( rot ) . Bad Pu-erh tastes like tea left to rot . This definitely does not . It has a warm oak flavor.Pu-erhs are `` double-fermented '' . Tea makers let the tea oxidize like black tea , and then form the leaves into cakes . Pu-erhs take awhile to ferment ; they actually have vintages like wine and can be as old as 40 or 50 years . Because of the longer processing time , pu-erhs are generally more expensive , so this is n't a bad price for pu-erh , although it is a little pricey for tea.This is good pu-erh for other reasons : unless you have a tea diffuser , you ca n't make pu-erh teas -- they 're not generally sold in bags . If you 're not really into buying a lot of tea accoutrement , e.g. , an American , these bags are a real find.Each one will more than handily make 3 or 4 cups of tea when steeped in a several cup teapot -- or you can steep repeatedly for a different taste with each cup .	1
First I 'm going to comment on packaging . My Lollipops came inside a sealed bag in a box . Since there are 48 of them , and they 're NOT the size of a DumDum - I did n't expect more . Each Lolli was wrapped separately , and you can read the wrapper just fine . For those of you who think they should have been packaged better - EXPLAIN HOW ! ! ! LOLThe FLAVORS : These are the FLAVORS I received in my order ... .Wild Cherry , Caramel Apple , Chocolate Marshmallow Sundae , Cappucino , CinnamonBanana Split , Milk Chocolate , BubbleGum , Key Lime Pie , Watermelon , Orangeade , Cherry Lime Jubilee , Very Berry , Green Apple , Island Punch , Cherry Cheesecake , Cotton Candy , Grape , Pink Grapefruit , Rootbeer Float , Rootbeer , Strawberry , Pomegranite , Grasshopper Pie , Lemon Meringue , Lemon-Lime , Butterscotch , Banana Cream Pie , Blueberry , Blue Raspberry , English Toffee , Pina Colada , Banana Split , Lemon , Mango Mania , Coconut Cream Pie , Milk Chocolate , I have n't had the opportunity to taste every single pop , but the ones we have tried are delicious . They taste just like the flavor they 're named after . They last a LONG time too - unless you have little chainsaws for teeth and can bite them right up ! I have no complaints ! Anyone who wants a `` regular '' flavor & lt ; cherry , grape , lime > - I 'd stick with your normal every day dentist lollipop.As for shipping , I use Amazon so much that I decided to pay for Prime so anything under this program ships free and usually takes 2 days to get to you once the order is shipped . I ordered these pops on a Friday , I got them on Monday , so it took 3 days total , with no shipping.Overall - I 'm very happy with these Lollipops and will definitely come back for more . If there 's larger sizes I 'd probably buy that , but if not I will buy more of these . It looks like every order has some different flavors so that 's great !	1
As a fan of the `` After Dinner Linda 's Lollies '' I thought I 'd start a new adventure and try 48 exciting flavors . These are perfect for every occasion and especially if you crave a wide range of flavors , but do n't have time to always make Coconut Cr & egrave ; me Pie or run to the store for Root Beer.Some of the flavors in this delicious 48-count box ( mine arrived in a plastic bag ) include : Watermelon , Buttered Popcorn , Green Apple , Caramel , Spearmint , Fruit Punch , Cotton Candy , English Toffee , Apple Cinnamon , Root Beer , Red Hot Cinnamon , Pink Lemonade , Pineapple , Peppermint ( perfect ) , Blueberry , Wild Cherry , Milk Chocolate , Strawberry , Raspberry , Pink Grapefruit , Vanilla ( so creamy ) , Limeade , Root Beer Float , Lemon Meringue Pie , Orangeade , Tutti-Fruity ( cute and fun ) , Peanut Butter , Banana , Lemon Lime , Cherry Cheesecake , Butterscotch , German Chocolate Cake , Licorice , Chocolate Covered Banana , Concord Grape , Chocolate Marshmallow Sundae , Bubble Gum , Cinnamon ( deliciously spicy ) , Pina Colada and Peach.Sound delicious ? They are all dreamy sweet and smooth and taste delicious . One of the lollipops actually has coconut in it , so that is the only one I 've noticed so far that had an interesting texture . I 'd love to be able to buy a bag of any specific flavor - because you may notice you have favorites ! A lollipop for every mood and occasion ! Also try the Dessert and After Dinner varieties to get the full range of flavors.~The Rebecca Review , enjoying Banana Cr & egrave ; me Pie	1
These are wonderful , I have seen them when shopping on a stand at certain stores . When looking for a nice lollipop I ran across these and could n't wait to get them . They last a long time and do not cut the inside of your mouth or tongue . LOVE THEM ! I did n't get some of the flavors that some listed but I got some nice ones that were not listed . Flavors : Very Berry , Strawberry , Wild Cherry , Key Lime Pie , Coconut Cream Pie , Watermelon , Root Beer , Root Beer Float , Cherry Lime , Lemon Meringue , Green Apple , Licorice , Mango Mania , Strawberry Lemonade , Butterscotch , Grass Hopper Pie , Banana Split , Blue Raspberry , Fruit Punch , Cotton Candy , Rainbow Sherbet .	1
Great product and very fast shipping . These are exactly as advertised , and exceeded my expectations . My only complaint is the price of shipping . $ 36 for 48 is a good bulk price for these , but $ 10 shipping is too high . I would also like to see options for larger quantities.They did a great job in selecting a variety of product , and they seem very fresh ( whatever that means in a lollipop ) .	1
Great thickening agent ! I was following the Whole30 and paleo diet last year and stumbled across this . It 's virtually flavorless and does n't really add a thick coating . I dust chicken with it when making Asian dishes , and it helps the sauce thicken and stick to the chicken . I 've added to my morning shakes ... Love this stuff !	1
This Arrowroot powder is excellent for thickening in all recipes . Does not add any flavor and it is a healthy choice .	1
I have been using this for my own homemade deodorant and it works wonderful ! Plus , I am pretty sure that this is the best deal around . No contest when you compare to what you pay in the store .	1
Arrowroot is a good , old fashioned thickener for clear sauces and gravies . I 'm allergic to corn and wheat , so this is a godsend , especially when making giblet gravy for the holidays .	1
Works great as a substitute for traditional thickeners , flour , cornstarch and is a great kitchen staple for those following the Paleo diet . I use it to make bread as well using almond flour .	1
I only use Arrowroot now for thickening sauces and gravies . It works much better than other gluten free flours and you use less so there is less chance of adding an unwanted flour taste to the end result . And of course I LOVE Barry Farms ; their delivery has always been trouble free and the communication is excellent . The product is always exactly as described and I 'm fully confident in all their gluten free products ! Love you guys .	1
This purchase was to give this a try as a more nutritional and natural product for cooking . I 'm very satisfied with the purchase .	1
Product was securely and well packed . It arrived as was advertised . Quality product for the price which was equitable . Would recommend this item .	1
This is better than using cornstarch or flour . Even my husband is amazed how my pie look and taste . A must when you make pies . Go try it for yourself . I 'm sure you will be happy with the result .	1
I purchased this in hopes it would save my jelly I worked so hard on . This is the best you can get .	1
If you like to save mooney , this is what you need to make your own & # 34 ; Jello & # 34 ; style instant puddings . Just google homemade instant pudding and you will find oodles of recipes .	1
everything i have made with this product so far has turned out great . i did have to kind of guess on the amount , there was only one recipe with this bag , and it was covered by a big shipping sticker , which when i tried to carefully remove , ripped off with the sticker . the product itself is wonderful though .	1
With clear gel you can make your own instant puddings . You can also use this product to add to a cake or cake mix that does n't contain pudding , it 's `` pudding '' without the flavor . Works great to make your cakes moist and tender . Instructions on the site and recipes .	1
A good product at a very good price . This is not easy to find at grocery stores and was exactly what we wanted to make pie fillings .	1
I have only used for sauces so far but gives a nice consistency . There is no noticeable taste and I have n't noticed any weeping of water that happens with regular corn starch .	1
This was a very good year for every apple tree in my area . Instead of the usual apple butter and apple sauce , I wanted to can apple pie filling.Most recipes warn that regular cornstarch can break down as a jar sits.The Ball Canning site suggested this product , and it worked beautifully . The recipe is on their website , if anyone wants to try it .	1
First , let me say that recently I have been testing a lot of thickeners and gelling agents . I have been looking for something clearer and cleaner than what has typically been available in the local grocery . After reading the description of Clear Jel I was tempted to forego this one . I am glad I did n't . This product is a modified corn-starch . What does 'modified ' mean ? ? I do n't know . And truth told , I do n't really care too much . The real questions that need to be answered are , `` Does it do what it is supposed to do ? `` , `` Does it do it better than a different , readily available product ? '' and `` Is it a cost-effective alternative ? '' With those questions in mind , I made the purchase and have now done some testing.1 ) Yes , it most certainly does exactly what it is supposed to do . It thickens 'things ' beautifully and without too much difficulty in use . 2 ) Whether it does it 'better ' or not is a very subjective thing ... although there are certainly some quantifiable differences between it and regular corn-starch . After using it for several fruit based liquids , I found the end results to be remarkably clear . Far clearer than any flour or corn-starch product that I have used in the past . Another real bonus , is its ability to maintain its thickening power after repeated heatings . This makes it ideal for canning purposes where the end product must be first cooked , then canned , then used at a later date . Some thickeners wo n't hold up to repeated heating very well . Another point to note is this product ( Clear Jel ) has been used for many years in commercial applications . That does n't necessarily make it better , but it does indicate that it has been found to be remarkable consistent and repeatable . 3 ) Ah , the real question is about cost-effectiveness . Clear Jel is not inexpensive ( at least in these quantities.. ) . I would be very interested in knowing what the cost differences are to a commercial account . In any event , the cost-effectiveness question can only be answered by you . I find it to be okay ... .not spectacular mind you ... .but then again I do n't use it every day . But , when I need something like this to make a thickened compote or a berry pie filling or ... ... well , anything that I want to can or preserve and still be colorful and CLEAR ( or anything that I want to reheat or do a secondary cook , then it is probably worth the cost ... at least to me.An interesting side note ... There is an INSTANT version of Clear Jel also available.Instant Clear Jel , 1 lb.I REALLY liked it. ! ! If you are only going to cook or heat your product ONE TIME or , alternatively , want to thicken something COLD ( NO heating ! ! ) the instant version is probably a better bet . ( Just do n't try to can anything with it ... manufacturer says it is NOT designed to be re-heated.. ) So , I give four stars for Clear Jel because it is that good . Could easily be five stars if you do n't necessarily worry too much about costs . Could also be three stars if cost weighs heavily on your purchase decision .	1
Great for thickening salad dressings or smoothies . I have never had digestive issues when using it although I do n't use it every day , and it is in almost everything you buy at the store .	1
I bought this product to make Copycat Starbucks Frappuccino recipes ... but never got around to it . I found a recipe for homemade ice cream that says to add 1/4 teaspoon for creamier ice cream . Guess what ? It worked ! Now , to play around with this some more .	1
Well , that says it all ... add some to anything as a thickener / tiny bit - works wonders . Fast delivery from family run farm/store ( nice folks ) - average pricing .	1
This malt powder is one of my 'go to ' ingredients for making high quality breads . A little goes a long way and you can often use malt powder in place of sugar if you are trying to lower your sugar intake ( the yeast loves this stuff ) . I get some gorgeous , shiny-crusted breads with this and it 's absolutely essential for a good sourdough .	1
Bought this to be able to add a little to my Alba shakes for a malted flavor-very niiice ! Wonderful to add a wee bit to baked goods .	1
Since I have always loved the taste of malt , I grew up drinking malteds , made from real malt powder . My faves were chocolate and banana . When I became an adult , it occurred to me that you could hardly find a real malted any longer -- only & # 34 ; shakes & # 34 ; . Also , as an adult , I begin to bake my own bread and discovered , through reading a lot of information about bread-baking , that & # 34 ; barley malt & # 34 ; was an ingredient that artisan bakers used in their loaves . At first I purchased the liquid form of barley malt and did n't even connect the fact that this was real & # 34 ; malt & # 34 ; , only in liquid form . I added it to some of my bread recipes and the result was a positive one , in yielding richer tasting breads . But the problem with the liquid is that you refrigerate it , and subsequently , it is a sticky , syrupy substance -- difficult to measure out . Hence , my interest in the powder form of malt . This product is the real thing . It has NO ADDED SUGAR , like most other products do . Other recognizable-named products work well , if you just want a & # 34 ; drink powder & # 34 ; , but if you want the most nutritious substance , able to enhance your yeast baking , AND to make divine malteds and ice cream sundaes , GET THIS PRODUCT . I will continue to buy this pure Barley Malt Powder . Love it !	1
Barley Malt powder is super healthy , since the sugars are largely Maltose , which do not produce a sharp sugar spike for diabetics . I have tried just about every one available , and Barry Farms makes the best one of all . The Barry Farms barley malt powder is sweeter tasting than most others and quick dissolving in milk . I use it with straight cocoa powder and milk in a blender to make a tasty chocolate malted breakfast drink . Two tablespoons of this only has 3 grams of sugar . This is one great tasting health food .	1
TVP unflavored is a good filler and can be given flavor by bullion cubes and other means , very flexible , but not real good by its self but an excellent source of protein in survival situations . I will be getting a good bit more along with other items to use it as an extender .	1
Since the new year , I am on a lifestyle change . Use this to reduce overall fat in your diet . Warning : marinate the chunks at least overnight and cook the chunks for at least 30 minutes in a sauce of your choice and enjoy on pasta , rice , or salads .	1
I used this for extra texture in both soups and stews , and it worked fine . A bit of careful use of seasoning and you would swear it is meat .	1
These are super cheap from Berry Farm . You just need to be sure you order enough stuff at one time to make the shipping reasonable . It starts super high , but as you add more items only goes up slowly . These are 'soy flour ' so it is likely that they have hulled the soy nuts and made it less good that actual soy nuts with the partial hulls still on them , but the texture is just like a really hard dried bit of bread . They do not soak up fluids much , so you can use them in salads or added to meals without them getting soggy.Very good . Just make sure you order enough in your order to not get ripped off by the high shipping for small orders . Very annoying from this merchant !	1
Shipping is a bit high with the seller . The product is as advertised , similar to other products of this type ( TVP ) . I find TVP to be bland . But that 's just what it is . These are nice big chunks . Spice them up and feel good knowing a cow somewhere thanks you .	1
This product is clearly gluten free , as it contains only soy . It is also vegan , obviously , so one of the few meat analogs that meets both criteria.It rehydrates well and gains a lot of volume in the process , nearly doubling . I put a ceramic bowl in my sink half full , like a cereal bowl , then pour in boiling water and cover the bowl with a saucer while it soaks . If I 'm steaming veggies I often use the water from the steamer to save nutrients and flavor.I use this mostly in stir fry dishes , where it will readily absorb at least a coating of flavor and of course gluten-free soy sauce.It has one of the most pleasing textures of any TVP product I use . I recommend it . Be aware that other , flavored TVP products may contain gluten , this one has never bothered me . It probably has a shelf life of several years as it is very well dried.I 'd love to also buy a slightly larger chunk size for variety .	1
Even though I write reviews mostly on my favorite types of escape novels , I was sparked by Amazon 's enthusiasm , to take part in the grocery store and gourmet food expansions here . My first purchase ( of products beyond books ) included a grain called QUINOA ( Keenwa.The product arrived in very good order and within perfect timing.In that maiden purchase I also added lavender and clove essential oils to my shopping cart , along with powdered cloves , and lavender tea . See my Listmania on Essential Oils ( which indicates which items I 've reviewed ) for info on the values and uses of lavender and cloves , available from various vendors here.I consider Quinoa to be the most valuable food available on the planet , a food which meets my standards for luxury gourmet in flavor ( and culinary versatility ) , in addition to being baseline healthy with full-spectrum nourishment.If I had to be limited to only 4 items or food groups ( in addition to water , of course ) to eat or drink , those would be Quinoa , Coffee , Dairy Products , and a variety of greens , spices , & nuts . Yeah , okay , dairy products ; and greens , spices , & nuts may be considered more than 2 items , but , for me they 're two categories.I 'm not a vegetarian because I love meat , chicken , and fish , but if I 'm working with limitations , I 'm making do with the most basic of basics , while still having enough food items to concoct satisfying flavor ( yeah , yeah , and nutrition , too , though according to my beliefs , `` nutrition '' dims and deteriorates , unless it 's in the living presence of `` yummy . `` ) .Quinoa , I believe , would take care of all ( or at least many ) basic nutritional needs.The way I simplify my use and preparation of Quinoa is to think of it either as rice or oatmeal , and then to `` gourmet it '' accordingly. -- As `` rice '' I add savory herbs like parsley , basil , marjoram , garlic , onions , etc . Actually , most types of herb concoctions or side foods which could be blended with pasta would also work with Quinoa . Think of what Lidia 's Italian Table does with `` noodle heaven '' ; then substitute Quinoa for pasta ( I like pasta too , of course ) . -- As `` oatmeal '' I add sweet or rich ingredients like fruit ( including raisin and date types ) , brown sugar , molasses , maple , creme , that type of thing.As far as cooking instructions , to me they 're basically the same as rice : - Add water or liquid in a 2 to 1 ratio . 2 cups liquid ( water , broth , vegetable , or fruit juices ) to 1 cup Quinoa. -- Instructions are given on the bag for boiling the water then adding the Quinoa , covering the pot , and simmering for 12-15 minutes. -- I 've also successfully prepared Quinoa in the microwave . You can heat the water to boil in a bowl then add Quinoa , cover , and cook . Normally , a microwave cooks 4 times faster than `` outside-the-waves '' cooking , but , of course that time varies with larger amounts of food . For example , 1 potato cooks ( on average ) in 4 - 8 minutes , 2 potatoes require double that , or 8 -16 minutes. -- For a single serving cooked quickly in the microwave , I might use 1/4 cup Quinoa with 2/4 ( ) cup liquid.I have actually simplified the process for myself by placing those single serving amounts ( Quinoa and water in a bowl ) in the microwave , and cooking it on high , maybe 3 minutes , till the liquid bubbles . Then I cover the bowl with a plate `` lid '' ; zap it for another minute or half , then let it `` steep '' in the microwave , without opening it , for another few minutes . ( Since microwave ovens and tastes for texture differ , you 'll have to experiment with your own microwave processes to get results which work for you , or just use the sauce pan method described on the bag . ) In the microwave , Quinoa seems to cook easier than rice.But , I also cook rice in the microwave in a similar method . I do n't use minute rice , since my microwave method works easily and fairly quickly , and if I cook it in a serving bowl with a plate `` lid '' I can just place it on the table for family style `` digging in . `` I love the nutty , barley flavor of Quinoa . Thankfully , so does my husband ! In the past I 've purchased Quinoa from Bob 's Red Mill and White Mountain Farms in Colorado , in the San Juan mountain area ( have always been satisfied with those sellers , when/if the products are available on Amazon ) . Having used many different Now Foods products , I 'm very confident in ordering any item from them . And now Berry Farms has been added to my list of healthful , gourmet goods.Quinoa has an iteresting history , including the development of a saponin coating on the grain : -- The genetics in the Quinoa seeds , after eons and ages of growing , had developed the saponin coating as a very effective protection against insects and burrowing varment 's , like worms or parasites. -- Knowing what saponin is and does , I began a habit of saving some of the water used to rinse Quinoa for watering my plants , or pouring on the ground where I might want to discourage insects. -- Once the saponin is removed , I 'm not sure how long the `` naked '' grains will be able to protect themselves again parasitic invasions . Certainly , Quinoa ( being a very strong , wise-old-grain with high integrity , for many reasons ) would be able to do so longer than other similar , eons-younger food offerings . I 'm not concerned about this , and will usually order either pre-washed grain or saponin coated , whichever is readily available.Quinoa grows only above a 7,000-foot-elevation and requires a certain growing climate , which can be found only in certain areas of the world . Some parts of the Rocky Mountains are one of those areas , not tested until fairly recently ( in terms of the eons and ages associated with this ancient grain from the Incas ) .Interesting stories about Quinoa 's long history are bountiful , but I wo n't get into those . A large assortment of books and pamphlets are available to read on it , and of course , many are offered here on Amazon.I remain ever thankful for magical foods ( which are both gourmet and healthy in quality ) , especially in our era of being told by some authorities that we need to remove the life , magic , wholeness , and flavor out of most everything . For the sake of `` health '' ? Here 's an interesting question to ponder : Why and how , for a while ( eons ) , did we lose Quinoa seeds , which had `` lived '' long enough to develop saponin . Why and how did we find them again ? For an easy , exotic recipe using Quinoa , see my review ofVirgin Coconut Oil ( Certified Organic ) 12 fl.ozLinda ShelnuttAuthor of several books , including : Molasses Moon	1
Great complete protein . Inexpensive ! ! Use in any recipe using rice or bread crumbs . Great for breakfast in place of any hot ceral . Just add fruit and cinnamon .	1
When I purchase this item , my local grocery store had never heard of Quinoa . I have learned to love this stuff especially as a breakfast porridge . Love it !	1
This is a really great product ! I LOVE quinoa , so I 'm always glad to find new sources for it . Thank you , Barry Farm . : )	1
I like to pop this in a pan . It `` pops '' into small puffs and the ones that do not pop are nice and crunchy like a little nutty ball of toast . It does not seem to appeal to everyone . I shared the popped version of sorghum and the response was 50/50 on the taste . Have not made cereal in the morning with it yet but people swear it is delicious with milk and sugar .	1
It took some trial and error to get this right , even after watching the videos.We ended up using oil in a stock pot , leaving it uncovered . We popped it at a higher temp than popcorn - lower temps and covering it made it take too long to pop , and it burned.Pops up roughly 80 % .	1
This is a good alternative to real popcorn if you have a corn allergy or if you just want to try it . It does n't have as much flavor as regular popcorn and is definitely not what I would call & # 34 ; sweet & # 34 ; like a kettle corn , but it is n't bitter either . It does taste very similar to popcorn.As other reviewers wrote , the key is using high heat oil ( Canola , Safflower , Peanut , etc - not olive or & # 34 ; vegetable & # 34 ; oil ) . I used stove top popping in metal revere pan with lid and canola oil . Pop it in small batches or risk burning it . Use about teaspoon of high temp , high quality oil and no more than a quarter cup of sorghum berries at a time . I popped it in a tall 3 qt revere saucepan with lid , but I suspect any of the churn style stove top poppers would be much better - it will make a mess without a lid . Once oil was hot I tested a couple sourghum berries and when they popped I added the quarter cup , placed lid on and slid the pan on my stovetop until many had popped . not all kernels will pop , but the unpopped will be tasty and will be as hard as unpopped popcorn.If you are not allergic to corn , stick with regular popcorn unless you just want to give this a try .	1
I recently caught a cold , and drank this several times a day in addition to taking Cold-Eeze zinc tablets . Shortest cold on record ! And it tastes great , too . I added a ginger/honey syrup for slight nausea , and they went together very well .	1
I love this tea . And it makes you feel very healthy , which is so needed during the Christmas and New Year season.. I have n't used it in one week , and I can soooo feel my body needing a good detox . I recommend for anyone who has stomach issues , over indulges , and wants to feel generally better .	1
I love this brand of Dandelion Root tea . The tea is so good for your health and keeps you regular . Transaction went smooth like always . So glad to hear Amazon may soon have home delivery of groceries to my door . I have some disabilities that require someone to shop for me but I do a lot of it on Amazon.com	1
Good product . I try and use natural food items as much as I can . this works great for me . It 's an enjoyable tea .	1
Love this Dandelion Tea ... great detox for the whole body but what a suppor tea for the liver and I have liver problems ... .I use loose leaf and bag when I am out and about and do n't want to drink restaurant teas .	1
Dandelion root is reported to aid in reducing high blood pressure , which is why I drink it . I 've pretty much given up coffee drinking and this is a tasty substitute , though one must acquire a taste for it . At home I use bulk roasted root but these tea bags are fantastic during travel .	1
These seeds are a part of my daily diet . They 're a good source of protein , sell at a good price , and include fast shipping .	1
Good product just do n't care for taste ? The product is good I ordered I because of dr Oz , need to be more discrimaniting	1
each one a gem ! delicious no fragmented bits and pieces just perfect and I will order them again..mi gusta	1
Good pumpkin seeds , tasty and fresh , not to mention healthy . Reasonable price , too , so I was happy with my purchase .	1
these lasted me FOREVER ! such a huge bag ! i stored in my freezer and used when I needed it . recommend .	1
This is perfect for making coconut almond brittle . Thing is , I found the same coconut at Kroger for $ 2.99 . I have never seen it until I ordered it online ! It is just so easy to order on Amazon Prime : ) .	1
These are tasty but a bit on the crumbly side , turn powdery in yr hand . Useful in cooking , esp . Cakes & frosting .	1
These coconut & # 34 ; chips & # 34 ; look more like shaved coconut with lots of crumbs . If you 've seen shaved parmesan , that 's what it looks like . They are dehydrated but otherwise are minimally processed . They are very tasty and have a nice texture for snacking , as opposed to shredded coconut . Of course , since they are n't chip-like chips , you ca n't eat them like you would potato chips . If you 're going to eat them right out of the bag , be prepared for pieces on your clothes and carpet . You ca n't leave them there because of the very high fat content . They can cause oil stains . I find it helpful to have my dog around when I 'm snacking on these chips.I did n't realize that the fat content of coconut was so super-high . Two ounces , or approximately one loose cup , contains 454 calories , of which 378 are fat . There are 42 grams of fat in a 2 oz serving , of which 35.9 grams are saturated fat . I know that there are health benefits to including coconut oil in my diet , but I thnk I 'll be using these chips as more of a condiment , like with fruit and yogurt.Coconut is a natural anti-fungal . One recommended use is for thrush infections . This was definitely the favorite treatment , but I ca n't tell if it was helping . Gentian violet has been the most effective so far for thrush .	1
So great to be able to shop for product on line . Unable to purchase product in my area because it is so small . Coconut chip were fresh and tasted great .	1
Nothing you do n't want , just pure , great tasting coconut . Very clean , good taste & quality . I recommend removing the coconut from the plastic bag & storing in a glass or BPA free plastic container .	1
Ten bucks a pound is a lot for cocoanut , and this is not an everyday purchase , but the quality is premium . Unsweetened chips of exactly the right thickness and dimensions . It makes a good snack straight out of the package , toasts beautifully and works well in trail mixes raw .	1
Thought these were going to be more like the large chunks of coconut that are slightly sweetened that I love . These are plain coconut chips . I 'm using them in my morning smoothies for extra fiber ... ..	1
This product was delivered promptly without problems . I found the coconut to be exactly what I needed . It is not actually chips , but rather thick and wide strips of delicious , moist coconut . Yum !	1
I bought these because I did not want the regular shavings in my granola . These are perfect . The would be good in any baking project or decorating ( cakes , cupcakes , puddings , etc etc ) . They toast up in the granola very nicely.Not that great for eating straight out of the bag though .	1
This was a terrific buy and very fresh as well . Intended to use it exclusively for baking , but we couldn 't resist digging in and topping our ice cream with it as well.Yummy	1
This is a style of coconut I ca n't find in stores . I love this for home-made granola or mixing in trail mixes . I appreciate that it is free of sulphites ( which I am allergic to ) , unlike most coconut preparations .	1
I was so happy to find sugar free unsweetened coconut chips . They are really filling and the bag seems to go on forever . I have ordered this 2 times now and will make it a part of my pantry as long as they sell it !	1
The price point on this on Amazon is insane , check out just about anywhere else , online , Walmart and you will pay at least half of what they are selling it for here.Okay on to the base itself . Just confirming the excellent experience I have had with this stock . Up until recently I totally agreed with several other reviewers the only way to get better stock was to make it from scratch . It is not loaded up with salt as noted by other reviews and I thought I had found the best chicken and beef base for a long time to come . Then I switched to Minor 's Gluten Free Base because I needed to be sure I was gluten free . Wow , it is even better than the Better Than Boullion . I have used four other brands next to this one , the Minor 's is the 5th brand and this is definitely the best , better tasting , no problems with salt , I love it , can easily add a dab to any dish that needs a flavor kick and I know I am gluten free . Even if I was n't I would still buy the Minor 's because it tastes the best .	1
This `` Better Than Bouillon '' is my wife 's secret weapon when making her signature Chicken and Pepper stir-fry . This is made from real meat stock and comes as a paste , which is much easier to work with than the bouillon cubes.This can be used anytime a chicken stock base is needed , but it can also be used in place of other spices when cooking . To bring out the the flavor of the chicken in stir-fry , the paste can be added directly to the meat while cooking and then , once the meat is browned , she adds the recommended amount of water . This makes the chicken flavor very pronounced and is one of our favorite quick dishes.Highly Recommended ! CFH	1
A little chicken flavor perks up a lot of things , for instance potatoes , gravy , a flavor booster for battery raised chicken . It makes it almost as good as the yard chickens I remember from childhood .	1
I 've been using this product for quite a while now . I order it online because , unfortunately , it is n't available for me to purchase locally . It makes a really rich stock . It 's easy to use just the right amount to make what you need . It 's a thick paste so it 's easy to measure . It 's a little difficult to get off the spoon , so measure it with one you can stir in the hot/boiling water with to get off all the paste.This is by far the best boullion/stock product I 've ever used . It tastes better than the dry cubes , dry powders and canned/packaged stock products . There is less fat swimming on the top of your mixture than with the canned products as well . It tastes as close to homemade stock as I 've ever seen in a packaged product . I 've also used the beef as well and it is an equally good product . It also does not taste as salty as the other products .	1
It 's a little tricky to get out of the jar and I wind up feeling like I am wasting a bunch as it sticks on the spoon . That said it 's so much better tasting and better for you than the cubes .	1
MUCH better than canned broth . Kind of a thick viscous paste in the jar , you mix a teaspoon with a cup of boiling H2O . Great aroma . I added it to a simple roux to make a gravy . I 'm really impressed . The flavor is much better than even homemade stock/broth .	1
This stuff is perfect : affordable , delicious , wheat-free , and has a two year shelf life even when opened ( though it must be refrigerated once open ) .I also love the veggie , beef , and vegetarian beef and chicken substitutes . The beef is my least favorite because it 's less versatile , but it 's still delicious -- it just goes poorly in rice and some other dishes I love.The things I make frequently with this are broth to drink straight on bad tummy or bad cold days , rice , and `` easy noodle soup . '' I like to either boil noodles and veggies with it or use hot water from the microwave or kuerig to make noodle and veggie soup . A little ginger and rosemary in the soups helps with a sick tummy , too ! When I cook noodles this way it helps to use very thin ones or to drink off the first round of broth in the mug and pour a second bath of hot water over more bullion and the same noodles and veggies so they get enough time to cook.I always have one of these open and one in reserve -- it 's great for regular cooking , but never be caught sick without some on hand ! I have yet to find a better stock , but I have to admit I quit looking once I found this stuff .	1
I usually buy very expensive canned chicken broth when I do n't make my own . Not anymore . This product is saving me alot of money and tastes delicious .	1
This product will enhance many dishes.. Soups , stews , chicken , etc . So highly recommend , you wo n't be disappointed . My DH asked what I 'm doing differently to chicken soup lately : - )	1
I think that this item is over priced on Amazon . It 's an excellent product , however , I have purchased this same product on sale for $ 4.99 at Stop & Shop ( Peapod ) . The price difference is significant .	1
I love this product and have used it instead of chicken boullion cubes or the expensive chicken broths in the can and have been 100 % satisfied with the ease of using and the flavor . It is on my list to continue to buy !	1
I like it because of the low salt content . Most other products will take me to the limit of how much salt should be in my recipes .	1
No , this stuff does n't beat boiling chicken carcasses , but it comes pretty close . Regular chicken bouillon ca n't compare . Mix this stuff with chicken breast , noodles , vegetables , and spices and you get a very good chicken soup . A crock pot/slow cooker really shines on this kind of dish.The problem : I live in Hawaii , one of the most expensive parts of the country . The most expensive grocery store sells this for 6.59 . I buy it for 4.79 . Usually Amazon shines on this kind of thing , but not with the Better than Bouillon series .	1
This is easy to make , and I add whole cream , cheese , and real chicken for substance . It 's wonderful , rich , easy to use ! A great break from some of the low-carb staples . Lasts a long time !	1
If you love buying rotisserie chicken you can layer slices of chicken on fresh bread , then dip the sandwiches in a delicious homemade chicken gravy . The flavor of the gravy can be greatly enhanced by using this stock base . This chicken base also contains turmeric and soy protein.Better Than Bouillon is a stock paste or more like a chicken base than a bouillon cube . Dry bouillon cubes are famous for being overly salty and that is why chicken base is a much healthier , not to mention , tasty alternative.One teaspoon of bouillon blended into one cup of hot water makes one cup of chicken stock . I use two tablespoons butter and two tablespoons flour plus the stock and a sprinkling of poultry seasoning , freshly ground pepper and paprika . Melt the butter in a small saucepan , whisk in the flour and then the stock.The stock base is also perfect when you are making soups and one to two tablespoons is enough to flavor an entire pot of stock . You can also put the leftover rotisserie chicken in a stockpot , cover with water and simmer with vegetables and herbs/spices to make a delicious homemade stock . I love enhancing the stock with Better Than Bouillon and the possibilities are endless after you learn to make chicken stock and then use this product to enhance the flavor.~The Rebecca Review	1
I used to depend on the powdered bouillon for cooking -- or the little cubes . No more.For chicken bouillon ( or vegetable or beef ) , I now use this product . `` Better than Bouillon '' is much richer and has a far more textured and better taste.Something like this is often called for in recipes . This is so much preferable to the cubes or powder that I would recommend to anyone using those to give it up . There is no comparison.Even better , of course , is using stock . But for many people , that might not be an option . Short of that , this product does well enough to work and is so much better than what I used before .	1
There is not much to say about it . I used this to make soup . It gives the soup a more natural taste and does taste pretty good . I bought this because it was organic made and the description said it was lower in sodium than the typical Boullion Cubes . For those watching their sodium intake this contains 680mg of sodium per serving . 1 tsp = a serving . The typical boullion cube is about 850mg . Its not a big difference but considering it taste better than boullion the lower sodium is a plus . They also make a reduce sodium version that has 500mg of sodium.Here are the Ingredients this contains : Chicken Meat and Natural Juices* , Salt , Cane Sugar* , Maltodextrin* , Natural Flavor , Dried Onion* , Potato Starch* , Dried Garlic* , Turmeric* and Spice Extractives*.It does contain Maltodextrin but since this is made in the US the maltodextrin is derived from corn starch . So if you suffer from gluten intolerance you should be fine.You might be able to find it cheaper locally .	1
I 've been using granules forever now.I saw this product and decided to give it a shot.I 'm glad I did.Very beefy.Somewhat salty.It added a ton of zing to my spaghetti sauce.No more granules for me.Great product.Recommended .	1
As any & # 34 ; home chef & # 34 ; can tell you making your recipes have a little extra zing of flavor is motivation to try new things . I am so glad I found Superior Quality Foods flavor bases . Now everyone asks me , how do you make this taste so good ? I just smile to myself and thank Superior .	1
We 've been using the Superior Touch Better Than Bouillon Beef Base for several years now . As the name implies , it is indeed better than bouillon . It creates a very tasty broth . And we 've used it to enhance the flavor of roasts and beef stews . I 've also put it in the water that I use when I boil brown rice to give some flavor to the rice . it works well for this . A little goes a long way . One teaspoon makes a cup of broth . I definitely prefer it to any powder beef bases . The one caution I have is for those who must watch their sodium intake . One teaspoon provides more than a quarter of the recommended daily sodium intake .	1
This is the only flavor enhancing boullion I will use ... I have all the flavors , in fact they have their own space in my refrigerator ! Use this brand for anything and you wo n't be disappointed !	1
I really love this product . I like the chicken version too . The downside to buying on Amazon is the price is higher than at Whole Foods- which is obviously not a discount store . I was hoping they sold it in bulk on Amazon , but I 'll just have to keep buying it at the store .	1
I usually buy this in the grocery , but the last few times they have n't had it . I really like the richness of this base . Really beefs up gravies , sauces and soups . Just wish there was more of it ! ! It is quite salty , so do n't add any salt until you 've added the base . You can always add more salt , but it 's hard to take it out ! !	1
This and the other Superior Touch concentrated flavor bases are now the only ones I 'll buy . I do look for them locally , though , having found early on that they are available for much more reasonable prices in supermarkets even here in the boondocks.I have found the flavor superior to any other form of savory base ( except that I 've made from scratch ) I 've used over the many years . But I found out the hard way not to salt anything I use it in . For example , I just made a batch of basmati rice with a wonderful flavor simply by adding a spoonful of this before heating the rice and water , and stirring . The clump dissolved fairly readily , especially as the materials began to heat . But when done it needed no added salt . I 've found that even the `` reduced salt '' varieties I have of this brand are 'way salty , presumably as a preservative . That , of course , makes sense to me as salt has been used that way historically .	1
I 've been eating low carb for over a year . Some things I really miss . I 'm no chef , and all the canned soups were out of range . These Better Than Boullion products were praised on a forum , so I gave them a try.How wonderful ! Easy to prepare , simple to add in real meat and other ingredients . I have also used tiny amounts to flavor omelets . It can also be used to make a gravy or seasoning to marinade a roast , for example . If you are sick of boxed drinks and bars , this is a wonderful addition . You can add real cheese or meats for substance , too . Perfect for cold weather , and lasts a LONG time !	1
If you love buying roast beef you can layer slices on fresh French bread , then dip the sandwiches in a delicious flavored beef bouillon . The flavor can be greatly enhanced by using this stock base.A dipping sauce can be made with cup water , 2 bay leaves , teaspoon beef base , 1 teaspoon Italian tomato paste , teaspoon dried parsley , teaspoon dried minced onion and 1/8 teaspoon dried thyme . Heat in a saucepan and then simmer for a few minutes until slightly reduced and it tastes rich and delicious.Better Than Bouillon is a stock paste or more like a beef base than a bouillon cube . Dry bouillon cubes are famous for being overly salty and that is why beef base is a much healthier , not to mention , tasty alternative . This beef base also contains garlic , onion and spices.One teaspoon of bouillon blended into one cup of hot water makes one cup of beef stock . To make gravy , I use two tablespoons butter and two tablespoons flour plus the stock and a sprinkling of freshly ground pepper and various dried herbs and spices . Melt the butter in a small saucepan , whisk in the flour and then the stock.~The Rebecca Review	1
I came on to see what other reviewers posted about this maaaaaaaaahhhhhhvullllous pantry staple of mine . I was surprised to see the notes about saltiness ... I have n't had a problem with that . Maybe my palate ( I almost typed pallet ) is off or maybe sense I tend to not add a lot of salt , this covers me ? I dunno . I was especially surprised to read that it contains MSG . MSG gives me a ferocious migraine and I have yet to fall ill after using this ... all that to say & # 34 ; I do n't care whay y'all say ... I LOVE this stuff ! & # 34 ; I will agree that it is a little pricey : ) .	1
I 've been buying this product at Costco for years . It is a fantastic product . Lots of great beef flavor , not just salt like a bouillon cube . The uses for this product are virtually endless.I saw that this product was a few dollars more than Costco , but with the free shipping , what the heck ... save a trip to the warehouse madness . I should have paid attention to the size . This is about 1/2 the size of the Costco version . Because this review is based on the product , not the price , still 5 stars . But I wo n't buy it again here .	1
This came to me packaged very well in protective bubble wrap and I was thrilled to get it . I am crazy about ham & beans and have been making it in my crock pot for years . I just used this Ham Base for the first time and will never be without it again . What a delicious difference it has made in my beans ! ! ! I am eager to make split pea soup now . It 's nice to know that putting a ham bone and meat in it is n't a `` must '' because of how good Better Than Boullion tastes . Authentic ham flavor . Love this product .	1
This product imparts a delicious flavor to beans , omelets , and gravy . This is the way to get the flavor you want without drowning in fat calories . Useful for every kitchen .	1
I was yearning for collards/turnip greens and could n't justify buying a hunk of ham for just 2 people . So , I thought I 'd try this ... ... ... it 's just wonderful ! Smokey and not terribly salty ... ..great meaty flavor ( although it 's mostly vegetable ) . My family are MSG sensitive , so I 'm careful , but this has none added . And BOY ! Did it make a difference ! Ca n't wait to make split pea soup , and purple hull peas , and ... ..We stirred some into canned brown beans and they were SO much better ! It does n't take much , either ... ... .. great stuff . Well worth the $ 12.00 .	1
Big fan of Better than Bouillon , their entire product line is first rate.This stuff is indispensable . I found out I was allergic to something used inthe curing process for ham hocks , and was pleasantly surprised to find thisham base right next to some of my other favorites like lobster and turkeybase.Anyway , for a pot of beans or turnip/collard greens this stuff just cant bebeaten , and without all the fat from hocks or bacon . Also great in soups butmy favorite is for making Red Eye Gravy for biscuits and grits , beats theheck out of using all those pan drippings and tastes just as good .	1
I 'd never heard of this type of base before my husband was in culinary school . They used a differentbrand , and a beef base had given a certain dish a flavor I 'd had in restaurants that was missing in home cooking.One thing to note - while these bases all say `` no added MSG '' it does NOT mean they are MSG-free ! It means they did n't ADD any straight MSG . They still have hydrolyzed items in them , which are a form of MSG.If you are sensitive to it or allergic to MSG , then heads-up , you might be careful about base products.That being said ... I 'd never personally used it before , so was not really familiar with it . I had a great soup recipe that I wantedto try , but it called for vegetable stock . There was not a drop of stock in the house of ANY kind , so I thoughtabout my new ham base . I stirred several spoonfuls up in a separate bowl with very hot water , but I probably didn'thave to do it that way . I then added it to my soup , which had lentils , sweet potatoes , apples , regular potatoes , onionsand carrots . I figured ham would work with any of those items individually , so should be okay together.Wow ! The soup was SO GOOD ! The ham base gave it a nice , smokey flavor . You 'd have thought I put a ham bone with meatin there with the other ingredients ! The base does have to be refrigerated once it is opened . I put the date on ours with a sharpie , but of course , that is n't super necessary.All in all , this was very tasty . I 'll be trying it with soup beans and cornbread next.As long as you watch out for the salt/MSG content , you 'll be okay . If you are not sensitive to such things , then it 'll be okay . I can tell you that both my husband and I have problems with MSG , but did not seem to haveany effects from this base .	1
I 've been using the `` Better than Bouillon '' products for some years now , and especially appreciate the ham base ! Raised on traditional Southern cooking , I was delighted to find something that gives me that flavour without having to use fatty smoked pork . `` Cook 's Illustrated '' recently rated `` Better Than Bouillon '' very highly . It 's also very convenient . Once open , I recommend keeping them in the freezer .	1
I add this to pea soup -- two teaspoons richly flavors a whole small pot of soup . Just do n't overdo it -- if you go crazy with this stuff you will end up with an overly salty soup ( it is a country ham-type flavor , so salty ) . It moderate amounts it is perfect !	1
I found this in Florida and used in my beans and greens and it was amazing and much more healthy than using fatty meat . Too bad I have n't been able to find in CT and I think the shipping is very steep .	1
This makes great flavor added to a pot of beans or any dish you want to add ham flavor to without adding a lot of ham . Fast shipping , well packaged .	1
This bouillon works wonders in navy beans . I put 2 tsp in one pot and Celtic sea salt and that 's it . It comes out very good and tastes delicious . Will purchase again .	1
I could n't find the ham base product in my store , so I ordered it online . I use this in my homemade beans and it is what gives my beans that great ham flavor that is out of this world . Even though I use ham hocks , I still need this for that special flavor .	1
Better than Bouillon comes in a variety of flavors . I love the ham base for beans and keep it on hand just for that purpose .	1
I love Lobster Bisque . No - I REALLY LOVE Lobster Bisque ! ! I go visit my sister in Provincetown , Mass . and there used to be a restaurant there that made the BEST Bisque EVER & # 60 ; they have closed in the last year & # 62 ; SO I did a lot of searching and found a recipe that called for Lobster Base & # 60 ; of course I could have used Bouillon & # 62 ; and no stores in my area had it . So I came to Amazon and knew I 'd find it.This base is PERFECT for Lobster Bisque ! It came a week earlier then expected so that made his purchase even better ! My parents came for a visit and my father and I love Lobster Bisque so I was able to make it the morning they got here . He LOVED it ! ! That alone made this purchase so worthwhile ! ! I will definitely purchase this again when I run out of the jar I got . 8 ounces will go a long way !	1
I make a seafood bisque with this , and it takes less than 10 minutes . It tastes as good as anything I ever had in a restaurant and is elegant and impressive but inexpensive ! Great as an appetizer but filling enough for an entree . I am waiting for the cool weather so I can make it again .	1
Mine ! OK , so now you know my secret so I might as well tell you that anchovy paste is alsocritical . Send me some royalties awright ! I have to laugh at the negative reviews for this wondermous stuff , you 're not supposedto eat it with a spoon , its a concentrate you nimrods ! Sheesh.I also use this in gumbos , and recently tried it in some homemade vegetable soup and guesswhat ... . it was GREAT ! ! ! Very versatile , I can imagine any number of uses.Better Than Bouillon has a great product line , and this is the Flagship . No kitchen shouldbe without a jar of this , and it lasts a long long time in the fridge . Seriously , whats tocomplain about ?	1
Being transplanted from the west coast to the Heartland was hard , but one blooms where one is planted ... I can not tell you how much I missed the smell of the ocean , and fresh seafood ... This lobster base makes the Best Lobster Bisque ! I add it to jambalya , fish cakes , and seafood tacos !	1
Well , I have to admit that I love the Bases for cooking.They do have forms of MSG in them , so those who are allergic need to be aware.They can say no ADDED MSG , because they add it in a different form than pure MSG ( which you can actually buy - it is a salty powder ) . If a product has `` hydrolyzed __ protein '' , then it has a form of MSG , which is created in the hydrolyzing process.Anyway -There is a recipe on the label that I look forward to trying , and plan on makingseafood enchiladas with this as well.Since Amazon sellers almost never list ingredients for their food products , here iswhat the jar says on the lobster base : INGREDIENTS : Cooked Lobster , Salt , Maltodextrin ( a sugar ) , Hydrolyzed Soy Protein ( form of MSG ) , dried onion & garlic , potato flour , corn oil , natural flavors ( ? ) , xanthan gum , disodium inosinate and guanylate , soy lecithin , oleoresin of paprika . ( As they 'd say on HeeHaw , Yum Yum ! ) NUTRITION : serving size 1 teaspoon.Calories - 10Sodium - 680mgTotal fat - 0Carbs - 2gProtein - 1gIf you eat out much , you probably are already eating these bases . They are highly concentrated , so you do n't need to use much . You `` reconstitute '' the base in boiling or very hot liquid and addit to your recipe . Very easy to use.The product should be refrigerated after opening.I 'll update my review once I 've made something with it .	1
I the small town I live in , it is often very hard to find uncommon items for cooking ... ..I found it on Amazon and I must say , I made some of the BEST lobster bisque EVER ! ! ! I am going to keep ordering from superior foods for all my odd cooking spices etc . It was fast and reasonably priced and it made me happy !	1
if it 's primarily made from lobster , what else is in there ? I wonder . Primarily ... Who uses a word like that on a food label ? It 's primarily delicious among other things , things we usually have no energy to talk about after eating a fine meal . I 'm so full of primarily lobster bisque that I 've been making and have come to be addicted to . NO ! I will not share the recipe , because I am too full and do n't feel like it . Primarily .	1
Just love seafood , this is the best base . Loaded with lots of flavor , great for boils , stews , soups . My favorite .	1
I do n't need to spend so much on mushrooms to make a superior sauce . Imagine a flavor base which makes canned mushroomstaste like you had spent a fortune on mushrooms .	1
I rely on `` Better Than Bouillon '' bases . I can use the exact amount I need without cutting up hard cubes . The flavor is consistent throughout the base and does not settle out -- it will never separate the flavor from the salt from the liquid and fat ; not even when left on the refrigerator shelf for months and months . That is important to me . The base is very easy to spoon out ; it does n't harden in the cold of the frig.The bases are rich in flavor , have a slightly sweet taste , and contain less salt than most bouillon cubes . This mushroom base is no exception : It has a deep , complex and authentic mushroom flavor.I keep several of the flavors in my frig at one time : The jars are short and compact and I can stack them if I keep them out of high traffic areas . It would be nice if they were designed to be truly `` stack-able '' , with a depression in the lid or bottom , then I could keep them closer to the front of the frig .	1
I have purchased all of the different bases and they are great . I must eat non gluten products and this works fine in preparing my meals . Flavor is great !	1
I 've been on a low-carb , high-protein Thing for over a year now . I 've gone from a size 22 to a 16 , and I 'm still at it , but I must say , there are things one misses . Soup is on the list . Most canned soups involve some kind of sneaky or even obvious carbs . I 'm no chef . The weather is cold . What to do ? I heard this product praised in an online discussion , and decided to risk living on the wild side . I 'm SO glad I did ! This makes a great soup , and the addition of some fresh mushrooms and whole cream really livens it up . Adding whole cream , butter , and cheeses works well ... if you are on a diet that allows those things . It really satisfies the desire for something rich and hot ... .one can only drink so many protein drinks and eat so many bars , etc.If you are considering Atkins or a modified version thereof , invest in some of these products . the ingredients are quality , and they last pretty much forever . No complex `` instructions '' ... .add a spoonful to hot water and stir.It 's possible that I might not like it so very much if I had found it right away . But if one has been in a kind of self-imposed food desert for 6 months or so , the introduction of a new thing is kind of fun .	1
I 've been using the Better Than Bullion vegetable soup base for a long time and this was the first I saw of the mushroom soup base . It was fantastic in mushroom soup . I 'd even add it to vegetable soup for flavor . By far the best bases out there and worth the money since you get so many servings out of it .	1
Adds a little extra flavor to make vegetable vegetarian soup . Great addition to my arsenal of flavoring , along with fresh herbs and spices .	1
This is a very economical product if you cook a lot and need vegetable stock or bouillon . I 've been trying to add more meatless meals to our menu , and this tastes very good . I made some minestrone soup that smelled and tasted delicious.I ca n't speak to any MSG problem . I 'm sensitive to it and avoid it , but this did n't cause me any problems . The ingredients are vegetables , and concentrated vegetable juices ( carrots , celery , onion , tomato , and onion , potato garlic ( dehydrated ) , hydrolized soy protein , salt , yeast extract , sugar , Maltodextrin ( from corn ) , soybean oil , spice extractive . One serving provides 28 % of the daily recommendation for sodium.One jar makes 9 1/2 quarts of stock .	1
I have been using this product for years . So easy to use . Am not sure why it 's so expensive on Amazon . I get this same product/size at my grocers and pay $ 4.99 and I 'm buying the Organic brand . I did n't know how to rate this , so I rated it on the product itself . It 's such a convenience , but I 'd never buy it here .	1
I am completely and totally hooked on Better than Boullion.My mother , my grandmother and I all have a thing for soup : we eat it , we make it , we love it . . . we 're not necessarily great cooks , but we have the gift of throwing crazy things into a pot together and making a truly delicious soup out of it all when it 's done.I have very occasionally selected other broths , and have always regretted it . This stuff is just GOOD . Other stuff is often . . . not.This is great in soups , marinades , mashed potatoes , or in the absorbed cooking water for meats or veggies . It 's really just tasty.The price fluctuates wildly locally , and availability beyond the chicken , beef , and veggie broths is rare . When I find this for $ 3-4 , I buy up everything they 've got . The shelf life is outstanding , and so is the refrigerated life once you open it . I also have a gluten intolerance and have never reacted badly to Better than Bouillon , and I have reacted to some other broths.Do check the label if you have a problem with some ingredients ! I learned the hard way that the ingredients sometimes change without warning.Happy cooking !	1
Ordered the Veg . base Better Than Bouillon because we could not find it in any nearby towns.My wife uses it a lot , so we will order more soon.We highly recommend this item as well as the Chicken and Beef bases .	1
Faster than making my own vegi broth and a 1000X less work . Though a vegi broth is easy to do , it requires a fair sum of random veggies to make it well . I have a small kitchen and small fridge so nowhere to store vegies everytime I want to make some broth to deglaze or make rice with . Similar quality to making it yourself and many times better than dried bouillion , much more flavor plus you get some of the oils and less salt .	1
I have only used this product once but enjoyed the additional flavor it brought to the broth I was making for a soup .	1
As long time vegetarians ( more than 30 years ) you get to know products that are meat free . My wife is the most wonderful cook in the world , making soups that people would die for , and of course veggie soups need a little adder at times . She regularly uses Marmite , which adds a nice rich meaty flavor , but she absolutely swears by the Better Than Bullion string of products with the Vegetable Base a favorite . I must say that her soups are absolutely amazing , and I think this base is a significant adder to those culinary delights . You ca n't go wrong with Better Than Bullion products .	1
I have n't been a vegetarian for over a decade , but I still make a lot of vegetarian meals . Better Than Bouillon ( BTB ) is one of my go-to ingredients for adding flavor to vegetable soup and stock , and also less expected dishes like pasta , or braised veggies and even stir-fry sauces . Though shelf-stable when you buy it , the BTB needs to be refrigerated once open . I keep mine in the door of the fridge for easy access , and can fit three or four varieties of BTB in the shelf where eggs are meant to be stored . Though it takes up space in the fridge , it gives me lots more room in my pantry and freezer , since I 'm no longer storing boxes , cans or jars of broth.I also like the flexibility to use the amount I need for a specific recipe . I would n't always open a huge box of broth if I only wanted a splash of it to loosen a stew , for example , but I can easily use a 1/2 tsp of BTB in water and dilute my gravies without diluting their flavor as well . You 'd be surprised how many places you can ramp up flavor with this product . I often use it in place of salt as well , particularly in saucy dishes where it blends easily . The sodium content is comparable to other bouillon I 've seen , but the flavor seems richer , so less is required overall.I 'm not a nutritionist but I feel like I should comment on the reviews which blast BTB for adding MSG ; as far as I can tell from my research , they do n't add MSG . Now , not *adding* MSG is not the same as not *having* any MSG , which is I think what confuses and frustrates some people . MSG is a naturally occurring compound in some foods , but can also be isolated and added into foods where it does n't naturally occur . BTB *does* contain ingredients that have natural MSG in them , therefore it has some natural MSG as well , but is stating the truth when they say they do n't use MSG as an additive.For what it 's worth , completely avoiding MSG in a typical American diet can be quite a challenge . I 've gotten really horrid migraines for a long time and spent years cutting out all kinds of different foods , including MSG , to try to decrease the frequency of my headaches . For me , MSG can make pain worse , but does n't cause it to occur altogether . My husband , being a thoughtful man , has made soups for me using BTB when I 've been knocked out due to a migraine , and with the quantities we use in our cooking , I have n't had any problems . Of course , your experience may differ.Overall , I highly recommend Better Than Bouillon 's Vegetable Base . It 's an excellent way to add flavor to dishes , easy to use and undeniably better for you than most traditional bouillon cubes .	1
The best bouillon ever ! ! ! Tastes just like homemade broth . A little too salty if use too much , go light . You do n't need a lot because its so flavorful . I buy the organic version . Love love love it ! ! !	1
I adore this brand of soup bases ! I even use it in a cup of hot water for a warming drink in the evenings !	1
I have used this product for years and would be lost without it . It not only works for any and all recipes that call for chicken stock , but it is also great for adding chicken flavor to things like mashed potatoes , rice , etc . It is very handy for the `` flu '' season when you just want to hunker down with a cup of chicken soup . For those times , I make a cup of chicken broth using this product . Sometimes , I add leftovers from the fridge ... rice , vegies , chicken . The other flavors are also very handy ... adding distinct flavors to your cooking repertoire .	1
the best chicken base/bouillions available , still very salty but the flavor means you do n't need to use a much as cubes	1
We regularly use chicken stock in recipes , and usually buy an organic version from the grocery store . It 's a bit pricey , but we like to reduce our exposure to non-organic chicken as much as possible.However , we got tired of the high price of such stock , and went looking for alternatives . We found this base , gave it a try , and LOVED it . It 's a concentrate , so it takes up much less cabinet and refrigerator storage , and it dissolves quickly and easily in hot water.Also , this is one of the few products that we do n't buy via Amazon Prime even though it 's available , but it 's currently available for half the Prime price from other vendors , and you can get multiple jars for one flat shipping fee , which makes is significantly cheaper than both the Prime version and also cheaper than the stuff we get at the grocery store.Put it all together , and this has now become one of the staples in our kitchen - love it .	1
BETTER THAN BOUILLON CHICKEN BASE IS ORGANIC AND A GREAT PRODUCT . I USE IT TO COOK CHICKEN , MAKE CHICKEN SOUP , OR JUST A CUP OF BROTH . I WOULD RECOMMEND THIS FOR ALL FOLKS THAT USE BOUILLON . HOWEVER , TRY YOU GROCERY STORE FIRST BECAUSE IT IS A LITTLE EXPENSIVE ON AMAZON .	1
I love this but I found the same kind and size in the local store at half the price . It 's great stuff !	1
This is the best base for soup and gravy . I just love it I use it to make spit pea , chicken soup , stews..very flavorful , not chalky .	1
Item was recieved in a timely mannor and was packed as to protect item . would recomend this item for purchase	1
This powder is for popcorn or for creating that familiar blue box color when making homemade macaroni and cheese . It 's flavor is acidically cheese-LIKE , as opposed to cheesy . For the latter , Cabot 's cheddar powder shaker , in supermarkets , is much better.Combining the two makes an extra-good popcorn topping .	1
Oh , this was heaven at first bite ! It is the exact cheese that Kraft uses in their little boxes of macaroni and cheese . I never liked the little noodles they used though . It is so delicious with regular ( Anna 's ) elbows . Just add a touch of vegetable oil , a touch of milk and this powdered cheddar with a pinch of salt . I have since purchased a different brand of powdered cheddar and it is no match to this brand . I will buy this brand from now on .	1
I was looking to replace the Kraft Mac and Cheese powder that comes packaged with the macaroni noodles . I used this with rigatoni , macaroni , and ramen noodles and it tastes JUST like the Kraft version . Follow the directions for making Kraft Mac and Cheese and you will not be able to tell a difference . ***UPDATE*** - I would like to see the nutritional information for this stuff .	1
I live in California and we arguably have some of the best cheeses in the world out here . I 'm originally from New York where I worked 4 years in a Sicilian restaurant , and my taste buds prefer whole milk products with low salt . I 've tried a lot of dried cheddar cheeses in my cooking and baking , but I have to admit that this cheese powder from Ohio of all places is the best I have ever used . I am 50 years old , but I also have to shamefully admit that by adding a teaspoon of this cheese powder to the mix , I am once again like a little kid and I now occassionally enjoy a box of Kraft macaroni & cheese .	1
Cheese in snortable form is too dangerous to be legal.I kid of course , but super tempted . Overwhelmed by just how this powder can carry the exact taste of mac & cheese to anything you put it on . The possibilities are endless . And the calories , 49 for 1/4 cup , sooo much better than the amount of cheese I otherwise would have needed to acquire this much flavor.Have n't tried a bath in it yet but tempted to . ( I kinda love cheese . It 's my kryptonite ) .	1
I 'm on my 2nd bag of this stuff.This IS the KRAFT cheese powder ! I at one point emailed Barry farms concerning something about it , and they told me it they buy 50 lb bags of the stuff from Kraft and break it down into 1 lb bags . All the same , its cheaper than buying the little round canisters of cheese powder that kraft sells for popcorn.To compare to the stuff in the blue box mac and cheese , so I suggest 1/4 cup of cheese powder to 1/2 cup of pasta ( uncooked ) -- but you can experiment for yourself.In terms of making mac and cheese , I suggest mixing it up with a little oil and milk ( as suggested on the Kraft Mac & cheese boxes ) and making sure the sauce is smooth BEFORE putting it on the cooked pasta or it will clump . The stuff for the blue box contains something to make it mix in smooth that the stuff for the popcorn does n't have , so you do need to work a little to make sure the texture is smooth.It is kind of sad that the shipping for this is so expensive ( over twice the price of the item itself ) but thats more about the post office than the company that sells it . Even so it still comes out cheaper than buying the little blue Kraft tubes of the stuff -- your not paying for the extra packaging .	1
Good stuff , I can pretty much choose how much cheese flavor I want in my foods . Great for home or camping & because its powder I do n't have to watch for shelf life or mold ; - )	1
This tastes like Kraft 's mac & cheese . If you buy this and some elbow macaroni , you 'll have the world fooled into thinking your dish came from a blue cardboard box.But hey , I enjoy boxed mac & cheese , and I enjoy using this cheese powder with other types of noodles to make shells & cheese or linguine & cheese . Perhaps I could even mix it into a white sauce and make nacho cheese.But the further away I went from mac & cheese , the less enjoyable I found this powdered solution to be . For example , I tried using it to make my favorite broccoli cheese soup , and the results were so disappointing I did n't even eat all of it . This definitely can not replace regular cheddar , but it sure can make a quick and easy , cheesy meal .	1
It is ( at this time ) being sold by a company that has listed a somewhat 'optimistic ' product description regarding it 's 'chessiness ' and somehow and CONVENIENTLY the product 's barcode sticker got slapped over the ingredient list.Fortunately it 's very easy to go to the producer of the product ( Barry Farm with the not surprising website of barryfarm dot you-know-what ) . Here you can see the ingredients , the nutritional content PLUS the directions for making a simple sauce.The PRODUCER of the product is clear that it is a whey based powder made with shelf life and stability products , not unlike the bright yellow cheese that most kids are clamoring for on their commercial mac n ' cheese.In other words if you are trying to make a mac n ' cheese with a familiar tasting cheesy sauce ( yes , I 'm looking at you Kraft ! ) but want to use your own noodles , this is a fantastic product . Definitely passed the offspring taste test even with gluten-free corn+quinoa elbow noodles . My kids thought this was great , and as a rare treat I am fine with the ingredients.If you want a yummy popcorn treat , this will work too.If you are looking for maximal healthiness , then do not buy this and make a real cheese sauce . Those are great too : ) Most importantly , do not be fooled by any particular vendor , which can change day to day . Examine the description closely ( and perhaps double check the manufacturer 's own site for details ) , and check the shipping fees . If it 's an Amazon-sold product then super saver/prime shipping apply . If it 's a partner-vendor who stores it 's inventory in an Amazon warehouse , then the same applies regarding shipping ( and can be factored into costs ) . If it 's a partner-vendor who does not do that , well , then you must double check the shipping prices as occasionally there are some 'interesting ' shipping fees to be found out there.Also , for a partner-vendor , do your due diligence regarding vendor feedback and decide if that is someone you want to do business with.I happened to have a happy experience with this product . The price was higher than the producer , but given the shipping etc it was all even . No problem for me . The taste was fine for what I was looking for ( again , I 'm looking at you Kraft ! ) , and the ingredients are fine on an occasional basis for my family . Your family and taste goals may differ of course.My only quibbles are with the vendor and how the product was described/labeled and that will be feedback left for them , not here on the actual product review.My 1 star off IS for the producer , as I think the directions for a sauce should have been on THEIR labeling which IS part of the product.Recommended , but read the descriptions and check the vendor out !

I tried both this product and 'Hoosier Hill Farm Cheddar Cheese Powder ' . Both are very similar with a very slight nod to Hoosier Hill Farm 's for better flavor ( IMHO ) . The products do not have a strong & # 8220 ; cheesy & # 8221 ; and are a little more salty than I would like , however it is powder cheese after all . I tried both water and milk in the preparation , and not surprisingly , milk yields a more favorable result . As a standalone cheese sauce it OK but not great , however I find it works well as a flavored binder or thickening agent with marinara or spaghetti sauce . The long shelf life ( if stored correctly ) makes it a nice product to have around , I & # 8217 ; ll buy more.Preparation : Like most powdered food stuff , mixing the product takes a little care to avoid a lumpy result . Its best to the powder in a small cup , add a little HOT liquid , and fold together with a spoon to form a thick paste . Continue adding small amounts of liquid at a time until the past becomes a thick liquid consistency , and then the remaining liquid can be added .	1
I am excited to begin using this product to create my creamy cheese sauce and to add to my macaroni and cheddar bake . It is a lot more convenient than shredding and melting cheeses or cooking into a sauce . Also , I think it would be a very good addition to some potato dishes to give them some pizzaz !	1
This stuff is great for making a tastier box-style mac . My recipe : prep 6 oz of your preferred macaroni , add 1/2 a stick of butter , 1/3 cup ( 45g ) of cheese powder , and 1/4 cup of milk .	1
I am admittedly a big fan of Barry Farm products . They make just about any food , veggie , dairy product , or spice in either a freeze dried or powdered form . As an outdoor enthusiast that enjoys carrying along a little taste of home into the savage wilderness , this is a company that I am well familiar with . Not everything they make is delicious , or worth it . My experience with them however is that most of their products are just about the finest , and many times the only ones around . This cheddar cheese powder is definitely one of their best . Many reviewers here mention making macaroni and cheese , and popcorn with it . Although I have used it for those purposes like everyone else , I have also used this powder as an addition to many soups that call for cheese , or grated cheese . ( It makes a very flavorful substitute for grated cheese in many recipes . ) Hamburger and sausage soups are a good example . Many times I have concocted delicious one pot meals using this powder while out in the wilds on a hike , or camping . They are remembered as some of the best meals I have ever had . It is also very good when sprinkled on home made pizza , and I have an excellent recipe that includes this powder , butter , flour , and salt , that makes a delicious cheese spread for crackers and super bowl parties . Barry Farms cheddar powder is strong and flavorful , and a little goes a long ways . A one pound bag will get you through many a recipe and outdoor adventure . However since the shipping on this is a little high , ( and the powder so reasonable ) I suggest buying two pounds or more at once and storing it in a good air tight container . You will save a lot on the shipping , and this powder will last for months if stored correctly . I highly recommend this cheddar powder for those that enjoy the simple pleasures of popcorn and mac and cheese , as well as the more adventurous among us in the kitchen , and over an open fire ...	1
i was a bit skeptical at first but it 's a wonderful addition to eggs , chowders , anyplace you want a cheesy flavor that tastes like cheese and not a chemical . plus it is not salty . it 's a true cheese flavor . this is a must have in my kitchen . just adding this : you can mix it with a buttery spread for a new twist on garlic bread , bake it in the oven for a few minutes , bread wrapped in foil at 350. my company could not get enough . i 'm sure i 'll come up with more uses . stay tuned .	1
I split this up into many small ziplock bags to prevent moisture from getting in . After a year , I 'm still using it . I sprinkle it on garlic bread after its melted , spray I Ca n't Believe Its Butter on popcorn and then sprinkle with the cheese , cooked eggs , for extra flavor in burritos , and macaroni . I like to toast a bagel , spread butter on , and top with this cheese and dried red pepper .	1
Goes well with popcorn and eggs it has a good taste to it but it does not store well it tends to harden and crumble with time still a passable alternative if you run out of the real thing .	1
I bought two of these , a small one and this one . They are a must have for the prepared minded person . Add some to any dish to add wonderful cheesiness without grating or making a mess . Very easy to use and has awesome flavor .	1
just a word of advice to those of you who are considering BULK ORDERING this product ... it does NOT store well ... ! if you order more than you can use in a few SHORT months , make sure that you have a DRY and preferably vacuum-sealed environment in which to store the unused portion.i bought a couple of lbs of powder and used it a couple of times ... stored the extra lbs in a kitchen cabinet in their original packaging ... months later , the UNOPENED bags of powder were as hard as rocks ... !	1
This powdered cheese is very flavorful and rich a little goes a long way . Made a thin paste for drizzling on steamed veggies and it was really quite good . Stirred a couple tablespoons into sour cream for my baked potato - absolutely divine ! So convenient to use it makes you want to try new recipes . Cheesy cheddar mashed veggies ? Yes please ! Cheesy scrambled eggs ? Next on my list ! I did deduct a star because I think the artificial color is wayyyy overdone . This is real cheddar cheese without fillers , but the artificial colors make it look fake and unappetizing . I guess I understand they 're going for that & # 34 ; mac n cheese & # 34 ; look with this powder , but honestly , I think it would be more appealing if it were n't fluorescent orange . Maybe with just a touch of anatto to give it a warm tint , or even leave the coloring out altogether and market it as & # 34 ; white cheddar & # 34 ; . The bright orange just looks ... odd , especially on dark green vegetables.If the color does n't bother you one bit , think of this as a five star product rating !	1
If you like Kraft mac'n'cheese , this product is for you . By purchasing this cheese powder and your favorite brand of macaroni noodles , you can make a wonderful macaroni and cheese for much less money than you pay for Kraft 's brand . I also use this cheese to flavor my scrambled eggs , popcorn , and casseroles . I highly recommend this powdered cheese .	1
Seems some folks in the review space have a problem when a pound of cheese powder comes in , when they ordered a pound of cheese powder.Let me break it down for you . If you dump this stuff straight on macaroni , you 'll get stubborn clumps and a thin cheese gruel that 's much more watery than your kraft stuff . You need a thickener , I use a tablespoon of flour for each serving . You need to break up the clumps in the cheese powder . I accomplish this with a blender bottle , basically a wire whisk in a shake bottle.Now here 's how I make one serving of macaroni . Your mileage may vary , my measurements are guesstimates as I always `` eyeball '' my quantity.3 tbsp cheese powder1 tbsp flourmilk , if desiredsalt , to tasteenough water to get it to the right consistency , not sure how much1/2 cup macaroni elbowsCook the elbows , dump the water , blend the cheese sauce ingredients with like a whisk or something , dump in with macaroni , simmer until it gets gooey . Add butter if you want.I 've paid the kingly fee to have barry farms ship me five pounds of the stuff so far , it works for macaroni .	1
This is very flavorful cheese . Sometimes your not too sure about powdered cheese ( the flavor & texture ) , but this is an exception . It is really great on popcorn & homemade mac & cheese . My family loves it and I 'll definately be purchasing more .	1
This product is great for making a cheddar cheese sauce , smooth as silk ! If you enjoy mac & cheese , or broccoli or spinach with a cheddar cheese sauce , this product is excellent . Great on popcorn too !	1
not what you might think but good all the same with the sour cream and powdered cheese make for some good potatoes	1
This was my second time ordering , got two bags this time.I use it on popcorn , on potatoes , for cheese sauces for over rice or pasta ... I also came up with a thicker version of a sauce that I use for a wonderful cheddary home made pizza that I just LOVE ! Just one of those handy 'always on hand ' pantry items that I now dread being without ! Will be ordering again and again !	1
Unlike a piece of cheese that eventually dries up if you do n't use it , this seems to last forever . Mix a little in mayonnaise for sandwiches and salad dressing . Mix up a little to dab on vegetables and potatoes . When you need cheese flavor you can have a teaspoon or a cup . I put it in an airtight jar in the cupboard .	1
I use this sea salt in an electric grinder . It works and tastes great , especially on fresh avocados and freshly cooked meals once they are on the table . I do n't usually cook with added salt so this way a person has the control over just how much salt one consumes . Excellent size for a salt grinder .	1
I used this salt to season a large guacamole mortar and pestle . It did the job well . The salt was crystals were clean and consistently sized . After it was ground I used it the last few months for seasoning and it is a good quality salt .	1
Bought to go with a salt grinder that I gifted to someone else.It came very promptly and as advertised . Nice looking coarse salt . I am sure it tasted great !	1
Salt is pretty much salt . It 's just a little too big for my salt grinder but I make it work .	1
Normal Sea Salt . I have about 17 salts and this is one of my normal Sea Salts . Nothing fancy about it .	1
This extra coarse sea salt is perfect for salt mills because the granules are so large they stay in the actual salt mill , which makes for less mess .	1
For an extra taste , the extra coarse sea salt is great for any meal . It amplifies any taste and goes well with other salts such asSayulita Sea Salt - Organic Coarse - 16 oz - by RealGoodSalt . What really gives this salt taste is the oil used in the product that turned out to be a distinct for the product . This salt is indeed a must have for anyone to add just something else to their meal .	1
Started the Wheat Belly diet and found that this does n't bother me like other products . Great for cooking or baking items or just in drinks . Highly recommend !	1
This is my replacement for sugar and it works great . Has a sweet taste and no carbs or calories , which is what I need . Trying to get rid of sugar in my diet is hard , but this certainly helps ! Thanks for a great healthy alternative !	1
I use only Sweet Leaf pure stevia for sweetening beverages and foods . The liquid is best for cooking and for adding to cold beverages . The dropper helps to measure it accurately . The price through Amazon is better than that at the grocery store . I will keep buying it as long as Amazon has it available . The words & # 34 ; Limited Quantities & # 34 ; in the product listing make me wonder if it will continue to be available at Amazon.com .	1
We 've been using Stevia Clear liquid stevia for at least a couple years , after using another brand before that . This brand 's performance is uniform , in that I can use exactly the same number of drops every time to reach my preferred level of sweetness . And unlike the other brand , there is no bitter aftertaste .	1
I will never substitute this Sweet Leaf brand Stevia . It is not bitter and has no after-taste . I have tried them all , and , this is the only one I will use or recommend !	1
I 've made my own extract several times but i 'm out of stevia at the moment . This is an excellent quality extract . There 's almost no flavor other than the desired sweet . Comes with a nice dropper . Ca n't beat it for the value .	1
I switched from Splenda to this stuff about a year ago and ca n't imagine going back . There is no weird aftertaste like with other artificial sweeteners , and a 4 oz bottle lasts me for a decent amount of time so the cost is equivalent . I need about a 1/2 dropper per mug of tea/coffee . I have n't tried to bake or cook with this stuff yet but will never go back to Splenda , which I am convinced was contributing to my tendency to develop SIBO .	1
Love this stevia.It is the only brand I use.Will buy again when needed	1
I 'm telling everybody about SweetLeaf brand stevia clear liquid . Unless you use too much , there is no bitterness . So go easy . I use 6 tiny drops to a cup of coffee . Our iced tea actually tastes better with liquid stevia than it does with sugar . Surprising ! Now I use it in a lot of cooking . When baking , use applesauce to replace the bulk of sugar ( experiment with it ) and then add stevia ( we use one teaspoonful of clear liquid stevia for one cup of sugar ) . I will not use artificial sweeteners because they are not safe . It was a happy day when I discovered stevia .	1
It is excellent and I use it all the time . I bought this for my Dad and he loves it too . Slowly but surely I am changing my family over to liquid Stevia and Sweet Leaf is a great product .	1
I 've read what others have said about the product turning to a milky white . I keep mine in the refrigerator and it did turn to that same milky white . I shook it before use and it continued to taste just fine to me.I bought more and will continue to do so .	1
I was looking to stop using Splenda and other artificial sweeteners . I also , while not a heavy drinker , was looking for something I could use to sweeten drinks instead of simple syrup which , of course , is sugar based . I saw this on Amazon and wondered if I could not only use it in my tea , but if several drops would work in other drinks . IT DOES ! So I use it in my green tea each day and add a few drops to your favorite cocktail and cut way back on any calories that would have come from another sweetener/mixer . LOVE IT and keep an extra bottle around always . Yes , it 's pricey but each bottle lasts months so it really is n't nearly as expensive as you think .	1
This stuff is great , sweet but easy to control with the dropper . I 've had it for about two months now and it 's just past half gone , I already bought three more bottles . The one drawback ? If you accidentally put too much it can get a tad bitter , but it is n't a problem , I use six drops in my coffee which is all I need .	1
Years ago I tried stevia and did n't like it . I thought it was bitter , not sweet . Now , because of my daughter 's coaxing , I have tried it again . I have been educated to not use too much stevia because it will become bitter . Used sparingly these drops will add a certain level of sweetness , but not quite to the level I 'd usually want . So these drops can be helpful , but you may want to use them in addition to sugar or honey .	1
This goes down in my Self Proclaimed Condiment Queen Nation as a `` keeper '' I saw it in the asian market i go to for 2.50 , a huge bottle , i looked at the ingredients , no preservatives or added colors , good , good , said it went with everything , also good , got it home and WOW , its amazing ! Garlic , Hot , Sweet , I am a dippin fool now .	1
This is without doubt the finest sweet chilli [ sic ] sauce in the world . I use it with hot or cold dishes , including chicken , venison or roast beasts . It is superb seasoning for a plain rice , quinoa , bulghour or cous-cous . Sweet , hot and authentic . I buy 2 of the larger bottles at a time , refrigerate the open one and save the back-up as insurance . Could not run my varied menus without this great red elixir !	1
We use this often and it is a great condiment . It is spicy without being overpowering and it is great as a dipping sauce for a variety of items . I also used it in my slow cooker on a whim when I was feeling lazy as a sauce for slow cooked short ribs , and the ribs turned out to be surprisingly tasty . It sure was an easy and quick alternative to making a more time intensive sauce .	1
Sooo good , I followed some advice and thought outside of the conventional box . Sliced up some cabbage and onion and sprinkled some Mae Ploy chili sauce on it with some Lime juice too , made a nice salad with a kick ! also very good with cilantro and daikon .	1
My whole family loves this sauce . I use it primarily to recreate a dish we had in Maui . It adds a wonderful sweet and spicy flavor to just about any sauce . Service on this order was spectacular . Several bottles arrived broken and replacements were received within days . Amazon service was fast , easy and reliable . I love Amazon . Also , there are many recipes that you can look up using this sauce that a very good . It goes spectaculary with coconut milk , vegetables , chicken or shrimp and pasta . We love it .	1
not truly spicy my 2 year old loves this stuff ! great on chicken , even chicken nuggets , for spring rolls- the crispy ones and even fries.it 's sweet and spicy all in one so very good	1
This is my favorite sauce on Thai food , Japanese food , Korean food and Asian food . I love this sauce on very dry rice and foods needing seasoning . It is a little spicy , but is sweet at the same time . This sauce can be used to dip gyoza , pot stickers , egg rolls . When I taste foods that is lacking flavor , I dip it in this sauce .	1
I love Mae Ploy Sweet Chili but I prefer more heat.So I buy the following , http : //www.amazon.com/Mad-Revenge-Habanero-Chile-Extract/dp/B0032ETK3O/ref=pd_sbs_gro_4 , which allows me to add as much heat as I like.I pour the chili extract into an eye dropper bottle , http : //www.amazon.com/Amber-Glass-Bottle-glass-Dropper/dp/B004TS3NOO/ref=sr_1_1 ? s=hpc & ie ; =UTF8 & qid ; =1362368052 & sr ; =1-1 & keywords ; =eye+dropper+bottle , which allows me to control the amount of chili extract that I add.The chili extract lasts forever ( years ) , however , be very careful regarding the amount that you add to the Mae Ply Chili Sauce , the chili extract is fiercefully hot ( read the directions ) and the eye dropper allows you to add drops of chili extract until you reach the level of heat that you prefer .	1
Hubby the Chef loves this ! He uses it on just about everything , even mixed in with a plain italian dressing makes an awesome salad ! !	1
I had brought this as a dipping sauce for dumplings and egg rolls I made at home . It taste 's great and I think it the same sauce I get at some Thai places cause it tastes the exact same .	1
I got turned on to this sauce by the following recipe . I really hope you like it because its what got me hooked on this sauce.For this pseudo sweet hot `` salsa '' you need to use Tostito Scoop Chips or this dip wo n't work and start the day or night before you want it.2 tall cans ( drained ) niblet corn1 long thin Japanese cucumber seeded ( discard ) and diced fine up to the size of a kernel of corn . ( skin it if you want ) 1 red bell pepper seeded ( discard ) and diced fine up to the size of a kernel of corn1 red onion peeled and diced fine Up to the size of a kernel of corn .. ( you decide how much ) 1 can water chestnuts ( drained ) and diced fine up to the size of a kernel of corn.1 medium size thickly grated sweet carrot2 cups Thai sweet chili sauceThis version is sweet and mildly hot . If you want a kick to this `` salsa '' add : Tuong Ot To Vietnam chili garlic sauce to taste . This adds the perfect fire without distracting from the Asian flavor . Do n't use tabasco or chili water unless you want a vinegar taste added.Add more or less of the vegetables you want in the `` salsa '' .Make sure that you drain your vegetables well because the sauce pulls liquid out of the vegetables . As a result the `` salsa '' is thinner and more watery after refrigeration overnight . I guess for looks you can drain the salsa of the watery sauce and add more Thai sweet chili sauce again . Use your imagination if adding new veggies and make sure that you adjust the volume of the Thai chili sauce.Mix everything in a large bowl as you add stuff and stir gently as you go.Add the magic sauce . Put anywhere from 2 cups to the whole bottle of this Thai Chili sauce , mix well , and chill overnight.Bust it out when its cold and make sure you use Tostito scoops because the sauce will pull some liquids from the veggies so the sauce will be a little thin . You need the scoop . Maybe the huge scoop Fritos will work too . You 'll be the hit of the party ... I hope ! Everyone I know who has tried the `` salsa '' has loved it . A large bowl went down very fast.This sauce is great for other dishes and I 've even poured it on my sandwich . I can see this easily being salad dressing especially with won ton chips ! You do n't know what you 're missing if you have n't tried this . I ended up buying 4 bottles and used up the first bottle the day I opened it.I forgot to mention that these guys send the bottles quickly by UPS . I bought it using Amazon Prime and shipping was included . The cost on 1/2/13 was $ 13.79/2 bottles with prime shipping . Seller was Asian Store .	1
Tasty stuff . Great with spring rolls . Make for a delicious dipping sauce . If you have not tried it before , you are missing out .	1
I read the nine reviews that preceded me and wondered how a product depending on a person 's taste could consistently receive five stars . Is something suspicious here ? Nope ! Here 's the tenth five-star rating in a row , and I 'm tough . This is the best sauce of its kind ( or any kind ) I 've ever had ; and I 'm an old guy who 's been around . Just the right sweetness , just the right hotness . I 'd love to soak a chicken in it , as well as dip egg rolls and chicken nuggets.These big bottles wo n't last and I 'll be back for more , fer shure . Absolutely more than worth worth the little price , this stuff should be standard in every home , along with plumbing.And my sincere apologies to those other reviewers for doubting you .	1
After trying different brands of oyster sauce , LKK makes the best , in my humble opinion . This Premium Oyster Sauce is definitely more expensive than their 'regular ' oyster sauce , but the difference in taste is distinct . It also has a much smoother texture than cheaper brands of oyster sauce.Amazon sells this for a lot less than at Asian supermarkets and online stores . I will definitely order future bottles here .	1
I like to try various Chinese recipes ; oyster sauce is a versatile , good tasting addition , that adds that Chinese restaurant flavor to several dishes .	1
This met my expectations and the price was good . Put some in when you stir-fry veggies are almost done . Delicious .	1
I use this to boost the taste of many ramen dishes and other asian procssed foods and I know it can be added to salad dresing as well . I am keeping myself well stocked on this .	1
This a fantastic sauce . I have been using it on all types of meats and in my marinades . A littles goes a long way unless you are going for a distinct asian dish , then use recommended amt . As for all other recipe , a drop or two will add a depth of flavor with a touch of sweetness that makes it a different dish than your regular recipe .	1
Lee Kum Kee Premium Oyster Sauce is considered to be the best tasting oyster sauce by far ( by industry insiders and consumers ) . This is the original , truly . The Lee family literally invented oyster sauce . Grandpa Lee was making oyster soup and accidentally cooked it down to a thick liquid and that 's how it was invented ( its main ingredient is concentrated slow cooked oysters ) . Oyster sauce is a must-have condiment for cooking nearly every one of today 's Chinese & Cantonese food dishes ( that have sauce ) and for a good reason . It imparts a unique flavor that ca n't be imitated by any other flavoring or condiment . Not sure what they used before this was invented more than 120 years ago , but we 're sure glad they use it now.Be careful when purchasing , if you want this exact sauce . Lee Kum Kee makes at least 9 or 10 types of oyster sauce , but this is the best one they make , their `` premium '' oyster sauce . Still , I wonder why it 's so expensive , since they have the power to buy oysters relatively cheaply by the millions and have already perfected the way it 's made , getting it down to a science that for them is surely simple to do since they 've been doing it for so long . Why so expensive . I imagine they charge so much because they can , since they have such a great rep for the best flavor.They make a darn good Hoisin sauce too , plus over 200 other types of sauces.The main headquarters of Lee Kum Kee is located in Hong Kong and has production bases in Xinhui , Huangpu , Hong Kong , Malaysia , and Los Angeles . So those customers in America who do n't like to buy imports , not to worry , chances are if you buy from a store in America you 're getting the product that was made right here in California.Having said all that , it looses one star for having MSG in its ingredients . I 'm also not happy that the price is so high ( higher than other brands , no matter where you buy it ) . I always wonder , how would it taste without the MSG and caramel color . The color is naturally brown , so I do n't see why coloring is needed . And salt is already a great flavor enhancer so I wonder why add MSG . I 'm still searching for a great tasting oyster sauce with no MSG ( and not so expensive ) but have n't found one yet . When I do I 'll be sure to post that info here for you all.INGREDIENTS : Oyster Extractives , Sugar , Water , Monosodium Glutamate As A Flavor Enhancer , Salt , Modified Corn Starch , Wheat Flour , Caramel Color.Learn about MSG and how many believe it is bad for your health : Excitotoxins : The Taste That KillsIn Bad Taste : The MSG Symptom ComplexThe Natural Diet : Simple Nutritional Advice For Optimal Health In The Modern World	1
An essential for Asian cooking . I have also used it on broiled steaks as cooked on the Hibatchi or grill . Arrived carefully packed in a secure box . This is the best !	1
Oyster sauce is one of my very favorite flavors in nearly every Asian dish I make . I 'd previously read that Lee Kum Kee is one of the best manufacturers but had n't been able to find it in my area grocery stores . What I usually buy is in a 5-6oz bottle and costs $ 4-5 . This brand adds just the right flavor , and it 's definitely cheaper for the large bottle ( s ) than what I 've been paying . I keep it on the fridge door along with the sesame oil I purchased on Amazon . Just typing about this is makes me wish I had some leftover Chinese food !	1
I sprinkle 2 tbsp of nutritional yeast over my breakfast of eggs and sauteed spinach . It 's a great source of b vitamins , and adds a very pleasant nutty taste to the dish . As others have said , these are n't & # 34 ; flakes & # 34 ; . It 's a very fine powder , which I like as it just dissolves into the dish .	1
very good	1
These are very good and tastly yeast flakes . I would not hesitate to buy this same brand again . I just transfer them from the bag into a clear plastic container that came with another brand .	1
I love this product . It has a nutty , cheesy taste . And way less calories than regular cheese , so I use it in the place of cheese in some recipes .	1
I am a new Vegan , so finding things that are good for me and taste really good were essential for me in my new venture as a Vegan . Well Ive only had it for a week , but I already have used it many times . Ive used it in many fruit Smoothies at this point . I really like it , I can see continuing to use it for a lot of my juicing and smoothies in the future . AND it tastes good .	1
This brand is excellent . The flakes are small and sticks to popcorn and blends easily in recipes too . I will buy this again .	1
Starting on this while I was pregnant as I had a b vitamin definiency with anemia so I started add this to everything ( and took floradex ) and it help a ton with my iron number as they go hand an hand . Anyways I love the taste of Frontiers Nutritional yeast and sprinkle it on my eggs every morning it taste like a powdery cheese which is really good if you have enough butter on your eggs to make it all moist or you can use coconut oil ( which is what I usually cook my eggs in anyways ) . This is the highest quality Nutritional yeast available due to there processing methods ! Highly recommend this brand , the yeast is almost a powder form for the mini flakes so if you do n't like powdered form you can buy it in large flakes also from Frontier .	1
I am new to being on a plants only diet . I did some research before buying Frontier Brand . I knew it would be small pieces , so no complaints here . I find that makes it easier to blend together when creating sauces . It is a learned taste , but I regularly sprinkle it on everything now.I only buy it here due to the reasonable price . I wish it was a subscribe item . I would buy it in a larger size if it was available.I keep `` cheesy '' sauce in my fridge to put on many things , pizza , quinoa , stir fries and tortillas . The right recipe and you have a wonderful mac 'n cheese !	1
Frontier Nutritional Yeast-This is a great tasting yeast to add to vegetables , rice , ect . to give things a slightly cheesy flavor . Great for vegans for a cheese alternative !	1
I use one everything I eat . Soups , sandwiches , ice cream . Healthy eating is when you can add B12 to your diet even when eating ice cream .	1
Having used Kal , Red Star , and then this brand , I must say that these have a less desirable flavor than the before mentioned brands . They smell different and taste slightly different . I will probably go back to the Kal brand .	1
I have used many brands of nutritional yeast . The frontier brand is my favorite . It adds a very pleasant flavor to dishes .	1
I used to buy the Kal nutritional yeast flakes , but when those went off Amazon Prime I decided to try out this brand . I 'm very happy that I did and I will only be getting the Frontier brand yeast flakes in the future.I use nutritional yeast mainly in vegan cheese recipes . Compared to the other nutritional yeast flakes I 've used , I believe this one has the best flavor . As other reviewers have pointed out , these flakes are much smaller than other brands I 've used and are more like a powder . However the difference in size/texture has n't seemed to make any major difference in any of my recipes.Overall , these yeast flakes have the best flavor I 've tried to so far and I will continue to buy them in the future .	1
im very happy , . its alot cheaper then the stores i go to , very fresh ! ! fast delivery ! , I use it like garlic salt or powder ! I use it in rice in My rice cooker to make yellow rice instead of saffron	1
We really like Hummus and we wanted to try to make it on our own . This should be really good .	1
I do n't use as much turmeric root as some others , so the Frontier Herb Ground Turmeric Root in a 1.92 Ounce bottle is perfect . Its fresh , ground finely and uniformly , bright in color , and I like the bottle as well as the cap . I 'll be ordering again when this bottle is empty , but I 'll also reuse the bottle instead of recycling it .	1
High in IF Factor , Frontier is the brand for me . Non-organic form but still not gassed and a great product . Frontier sells it in both organic and non-organic form . I purchase it in the bigger silver bags as well.SCRUB : I blend few different oils and spices together to get the right mix for my skin . I blend EVCO , EVOO , avocado , raw honey , turmeric , coffee , germ wheat oil , almond oil , castor oil and ginger . Avocado and germ wheat oils high in vitamin E soften skin , castor oil removes black spots on the skin , EVOO is a hydrator and antioxidant , EVCO and raw honey are antibacterial , coffee exfoliates and tightens loose skin , turmeric reduces inflammation and ginger fight illness . I mix and add few drops of cold boiled water as needed a drop at a time till the mix forms a paste . I spread the mix over my skin and rub . I let it dry and rinse off in the shower . Afterward I apply almond , EVOO and EVCO.FOOD : I used to consume Sun Brand Curry Powder for years since it was the best but not any longer since I mix my own curry powder and more importantly I want to avoid sodium which is added in all spices regardless of the brand . No wonder everyone is selling turmeric in pills since it has such a high nutritional value , manganese 26 % , iron 16 % , Phytosterols 5.5 for cholesterol and most importantly inflammation factor of 1,523 ; all in one tablespoon . No need to consume pills since I put few spoons of this golden beauty turmeric into my dishes for its health benefits . Sun Brand curry powder has some 30 spices . If you are after a spice mix Sun Brand is the best but certainly with noticeable sodium.PROPERTIES : Turmeric contains 3 % -6 % of a group of yellow pigments called curcuminoids of which curcumin is the main pigment . Curcumin gives the rhizome its orange- yellow color and its level is an indication of quality . Turmeric is traded world-wide based on curcumin content . Frontier prints 5 % on their 16oz bag but no mention of 5 % anywhere on this labelling . Frontier needs to specify.Stomach upset ( dyspepsia ) ... Some research shows that taking turmeric by mouth might help improve an upset stomach.Osteoarthritis ... Some research shows that taking some turmeric extracts can reduce the pain caused by osteoarthritis of the knee . In one study , turmeric worked about as well as ibuprofen for reducing pain.Now both research claims it MAY POSSIBLY BE EFFECTIVE , every other claim which there are hundreds of miracle claims , are all hypes . I know turmeric is helpful for joints but the trick is to buy it from a reputable producer , seller and to make sure it is fresh , real fresh .	1
What can I say ? I like it . It 's natural and it 's a healthy herb known to fight/ward off cancer . Only wish it was organic , but one ca n't have everything , can one ? Overall , a worthwhile purchase I do n't hesitate to recommend to others .	1
I debated whether to leave a review , given that there are so many , and especially given that the one that is currently ranked most helpful , conveys ( for the most part ) my 'take ' on this salt ( including the fact that I , as well , use it as a finishing salt [ and for the same reasons ] to asparagus , and to meats ... additionally , I sprinkle the flakes atop various other foods [ including hash browns ] , just before serving ) .I decided to go ahead and leave a review , however , and despite the fact that it would be among the so many singing the praises of this remarkable and unique salt . And while seemingly at risk of positive review after positive review perhaps sounding 'broken record ' -like , to some , my thinking is that in addition to the unique aspects found in a given review , if it helps anyone to have a particular impression and a specific 'use profile ' with this salt found in more than one review , then I 'm glad -- I know that it 's been helpful to me , in my own experience , when reading through reviews of other products , prior to my having tried an associated item for the first time.This salt is incredible , and SO different from other salts , in terms of both its texture and its taste . The coarseness , crunchiness , beautiful appearance , and wonderful taste of this salt lend themselves to inspired use . And adding this salt to the 'finishing touches ' of a particular item can , all by itself , render the subsequent serving of said item a 'special occasion ' ( that 's how it feels for me ) .I 've been spontaneously inspired to add this salt to various things ( let alone things to which I would not otherwise add salt [ or if I did , it would involve nowhere near the taste experience and outcome of that achieved when adding Maldon salt ] ) , including freshly torn pieces of roast chicken ( to make a heavenly treat with a delightful added taste and 'crunch factor ' ) ... and to a hardboiled egg that has been sliced in half ( which , for me , 'elevates ' the subsequent taste experience from something simple to something with an almost regal decadence ) ... as well as to the top of a simply prepared plate of 'nachos ' consisting of baked blue corn tortilla chips with a minimal amount of melted mild cheddar-like cheese ( and is especially good if the cheese is made from sheep 's milk ) -- to which the added flakes of Maldon salt atop the freshly melted cheese result in a 'sinfully delicious ' taste and 'crunch ' experience ( with the Maldon salt 's taste doing a special 'dance ' with the mild saltiness of the melted cheese , and piggybacking a slamdunk terrific taste on the cheese-being-compressed-into-it bite into the chip ) .From the first time I tasted Maldon salt , over 10 years ago , I have considered it the best salt that I have ever tasted , and to possess my absolute favorite texture , as well -- the crunchiness of this salt , when combined with its taste , make for a heavenly combination . And the sheer look of its beautiful flakes adds its own aesthetic enhancement to anything one 'dresses ' with it.I love Maldon salt , and consider it a kind of 'special ops ' wildcard of sorts , 'in the kitchen ' : ) -- this salt has transformative power , when it comes to food items to which it is added/topped with ... and with respect to the resulting taste and crunch factor , there are striking 'before and after ' 'pics ' ( so to speak ) , when it comes to the 'taste makeovers ' possible in conjunction with its being the sole difference . When sprinkling flakes of this salt atop various items , I might as well be waving a magic wand ... : ) Honestly , the 'reaction ' I experience , when partaking of an item to which I 've added Maldon Salt , is deserving of its own theme music . And while not matching in 'tone ' , music-wise , to what it is I experience , the title of Tina Turner 's `` Simply the Best '' is nonetheless more than apropos ... : )	1
Man I love this salt . I swear even compared to other premium sea salts there 's something special about this stuff . I have been using it exclusively for a year or so now and have even given it as a gift along with good peppercorns and olive oil and my friends that are n't foodies were really surprised at what a difference good salt makes.Not that this matters but I see this salt being used on Iron Chef America frequently .	1
I 've been looking for some nice sea salt flakes that can serve both as regular salt and add that special crunch as a finishing salt . I would highly recommend this salt ! In a pinch if I 've ran out of my other salt , I use this and it works great ! !	1
This salt tastes brighter and more alive than regular salt . Not something I buy all the time , but its nice to have something a little different .	1
Having this flake salt on my table is n't a big deal , but when I sprinkle it on my food , it 's a burst of sea saltiness that I enjoy very much , and I know I 'm also caring for my health , in one more small way . I 'm the only one who uses it , so the two boxes last a long time , and I 'm almost out , so I just ordered more . I have other sea salts for other uses . I just realized lately that this one makes an awesome salt to coat the rim of my margarita glass ... .also healthy , made with organic fruit juices and 100 % agave tequila . Life is good : )	1
These flakes are very nice for finishing dishes with . I do n't use this for cooking ( I use cheaper sea salt for that ) but simply to give texture and fresh saltiness to finished dishes . Shipping takes quite awhile since mine came from UK , but it 's worth it .	1
If you 're a foodie , then you know salts have distinctive flavors just like anything else . Maldon is my favorite salt . I use it on everything ! But , it 's EXPENSIVE in my local grocery stores.After finding it here on Amazon for such a fantastic price and quantity , I 'll never have to do without it again : )	1
This salt is a great finishing salt for sweet or savory foods . It flakes well between the fingers and has a pure taste . I buy on amazon because it beats out my local grocery price any day . I will be buying again .	1
I tried this salt because of a certain cookbook I got that recommended it . The crystals are larger than I am used to but the flavor is very nice . I recommend that when using it you grab a pinch and grind it between your fingers as you put it on food .	1
I purchased this salt for a recipe for pretzel bread , and now it 's starting to show up in other recipes I 've been looking at ! The flavor of the salt is strong , bright and clean . I would advise to use sparingly !	1
This is not the salt you want to dissolve in your everyday cooking . What it 's good for is an added salty crunch atop your fried eggs , or other cooked foods . A crunchy surprise in salads and completely marvelous when added to your cookie batter . There you are eating your cookie and all of a sudden you get a tiny salty treat . The sweet and the salty together are unbeatable !	1
Maldon is the best for making salt blends and encrusting things in salt ! I 've tried so many others but this is the perfect shape for the best salt base !	1
It has interested me for many years that in a society where we know sodium contributes to health issues , our supply of assorted gourmet salts is increasing . In all honesty , for average cooking as in salting water or soups , I grab the old standby of Kosher salt , For applications where the salt is added after the preparation , I often add Maldon Sea Salt Flakes from the UK . My arsenal includes salts from all over the world , but there is something about this one that is my favorite when chocolate items are finished off with salt . Caramels made with salt really pop when the Maldon is used . I 've had Maldon sea salt flakes in my cabinet for many years and doubt that I 'll ever be without it . It 's that good .	1
I love the texture & snowflakey composition of this truly marvelous salt ... of which a treat is simply to eat it straight out of the package ... .also excellent on chocolates & atop buttered bread . Honestly , I am a Salty Dawg & Maldon 's is the best ( HENCE MY PURCHASE OF 2 MORE BOXES ) ...	1
I have been a fan for Maldon salt for many years now , once you discover this well known kitchen gem you will never look back , I stopped to write a review because I was making another purchase and realized that I never wrote anything about it on Amazon ... The pyramid shaped flaky crystals can be sprinkled on for light as air like salt crunch or broken between the fingers as it gets sprinkled on anything and everything . Grilled veggies never had it so good . Salted Caramel is beyond luscious with this added in . I use this in place of most salt in my cooking even tough I have about ten vials of various salts ranging from Grey Hawaiian Lava , Pink Himalayan , Bamboo Jade , Hawaiian Red Alaea to a Black course grind ( great with lemonade ) on my counter , I cook a lot so I go a bit nuts with this stuff . This is worth the buck and lasts a while , I say try it once then see how you feel about it , I use this as my daily basic cooking salt but it 's really so much more as the taste and texture surpasses anything else salt related that I have ever bought.I also buy their peppercorns which are really zesty and the gorgeous pinkish smoked salt , this is so good that it best my usual stand by , Kosher salt which is nice and delicate but does n't have the crunch and flavor of Maldon . This is the best salt hands down , soft and flaky , crunchy and slightly briny , it has a fresh ocean taste that truly tantalizes the taste buds.- Kasia S .	1
So far this is he best sea salt . It has a very good taste , no after taste and pinching between your fingers the salt actually gets distributed better than a shaker or grinder . Will keep buying this !	1
I will never have a pantry without this . An excellent finish to veggies , especially edamame . the crunch really does make a difference . Simply my favorite . Everyone asks 'what kind of salt is this ? & # 34 ;	1
Product is exactly as described in it 's literature . Nice flaky salt with a gentle flavor .	1
I use this Maldon salt nearly every day ! It is perfect for finishing , so you get that beautiful crunch from the perfect little salt flakes . I would definitely recommend for any cook !	1
I do n't use a lot of salt -- so when I do , I want it to be good stuff.This is super . I do n't have to use a lot to get the flavor I want -- just a pinch or two . The flakes are easy to `` crush '' and that seems to release the flavor.Amazon 's price for this is super , too . The 8.5-oz box lasts a long time for me . Definitely my first choice in salt .	1
I do n't know why I have always resisted buying this for so many years , I do n't know if the term flake put me off or what but it is SO good . You crush it between your fingers and sprinkle over food . I think this goes great whole on top of sweets like chocolates or cupcakes for the salted caramel flavor - you get a flaky salty crunch that is awesome . I think its great for cooking with as long as you break it down with your fingers , we keep it in a salt box on the counter and it is all we use now .	1
Great Salt ! Love the texture , I exclusively use it as a finishing salt right before I serve my dishes . Highly recommended for any foodie or salt lover .	1
How can you not love Maldon Sea Salt ? This is the real thing and I love it . One of my favorite salts .	1
a great salt product	1
I love salt . I would not eat it out of the box but I add a lot of salt to my food and this salt is fantastic . The taste is lovely and the crunch is great . I have been using it solely on desserts thus far and I works so well with my salted caramel chocolate torte . A sprinkle on top of the chocolate top makes a world of difference . It did not dissolve or get watery the way regular salt or even other sea salts would have . It stayed crunchy and whole to the end . You can not go wrong with this salt .	1
This is great tasting salt and this bag will last you a long long time . I grid it with a hand grinder and use it all the time .	1
I have become a huge fan of different salts for different dishes . Maldon salt is one I saw on a cooking program and I just had to have it to prepare the recipe of the day . It performs just as they said it would . I recommend this to anyone wishing to expand their salt collection .	1
I bought this partly because my pink Himalayan sea salt , while fine for cooking , has a tendency to coat my fingers when I pinch it to spread on food . Salt flakes sounded like a better idea.I was right . These salt flakes are more coarse , perhaps a bit larger than sesame seeds but certainly not on the level of corn flakes . They taste fine , have a very nice texture while pinching , and give a delightful crunch when chewed . It 's tough to argue with all this.The container has a certain d & eacute ; class & eacute ; air about it and would be right at home in a French bistro , so you might not feel a need to get a salt box . One would be advisable anyway , just in case , since box ca n't easily be used as a dispenser once it starts to empty out significantly .	1
Slate Magazine has a review on table salts and this was the winner . So I ordered some from Amazon and compared it myself to the brands available where I live , including Celtic Sea Salt . There is no comparison ... Maldon is the standout winner . It is big flaky , crunchy pieces of very tasty salt . This is not a baking salt . It is more of a finishing salt to go `` on '' foods . It 's wonderful on avocado , steamed yellow squash , baked potatoes ... etc . The Slate reviewer said he loved it the best on chocolate H & auml ; agen-Dazs ice cream ! It 's that good .	1
I love the texture of this salt - I use it in place of kosher salt for finishing food because it looks great and has a wonderfully irregular texture . Perfect for sprinkling on salted caramels or other sweet salty goodies .	1
this is the classic & # 34 ; gourmet & # 34 ; salt . It is very coarse and hard , so this is not a finishing salt , nor should you use it in an application where it ca n't sufficiently dissolve . It has a very bold salty taste , so a little goes a long way !	1
This salt is the bomb . I sprinkle it as a finishing salt on meat , veggies , etc . It has a great crunchy flakiness that I like better then kosher for that . It 's a little pricey so I save it for finishing and not for baking .	1
I love this salt ! And for the reviewers concerned about it not melting quickly ... it 's not supposed to . It 's a FINISHING salt . It 's a complete waste to cook with it , plus it 's hard to come up with equivalent measures if you were to use it when cooking in place of kosher or table salt . But sprinkled on a rib eye fresh off the grill , on a pan seared salmon filet just before you serve it , on roasted aspargus right out of the oven , or even over a fresh , crisp apple half - it 's `` Na '' heaven ! If you already use finishing salts , you know what difference they can make . And if you 're not , it 's an easy way to take your dishes to the next level . Bon appetite !	1
Greetings ! I like this salt because it is a status symbol . If I put this salt on the table everyone will know I have excellent taste and refinement . In any case , if Maldon is good enough for the Queen it is good for sure ! Not only because she is a Queen but because grandmothers just seem to know what is good to have in the kitchen . I take a pinch of Maldon salt flakes , crush and sprinkle on foods . Makes the food quite tasty . The texture of Maldon salt flakes is neither too hard nor too soft . Seems just right . I recommend giving Maldon Sea Salt Flakes a try . Cheerio !	1
I use Nutritional yeast in a lot of things . Most assume it tastes like cheese ? Not exactly , but it tastes good and works well with mac and `` cheese '' .I like to put it mainly on pizza , but I will sprinkle some on sandwiches and in other soups.Great product for vegans .	1
We loved this product ! It made cooking better as it gave our vegan food much more flavor ! We recommend this to anyone .	1
We only started using this product about a month ago and have already burned through two containers . It 's rich in vitamin B-12 and other nutrients but more importantly imparts a cheesy flavor similar to Parmesan . It 's effective at dressing up salads , vegan mac-and-cheese and pasta sauces but it really shines as a topping for vegan pizza . As an aside , it 's a shame this is n't currently an Amazon Prime product since the shipping doubles the cost .	1
This little bargain was worth every penny ! I like the freshness of the nutritional yeast as some places only offer it in bulk at these prices ! I have used this brand 's yeast for baking and took a chance and I was pleasantly surprised.I used this for cheezy sauce , and in some vegan burgers to add a savory flavor ; - )	1
Yes , this stuff is grrrrreat ! I hope I never have to live life without it . I even got non-vegetarians eating it on their pasta instead of parmesan cheese . Price is high here on Amazon . I buy mine at Wholefoods for five bucks .	1
Can you have too much of this stuff ? Haha ! I love it on my popcorn , in tofu scramble , the vegan & # 34 ; cheeses & # 34 ; I make , etc .	1
I did n't get the & # 34 ; cheesy & # 34 ; flavor vegans talk about , but this is delicious on popcorn . It 's also good on toast .	1
I like this product , and use it on salads and pasta dishes . It adds a cheesy flavor , but it is definitely something you have to acquire a taste for .	1
I like this kind of nutritional yeast . it has a good taste and I like that it comes in a shaker bottle . usually part of the reason I 'm reluctant to buy yeast is because it gets everywhere . but with this container it is easy to use and not messy	1
I am loving nutritional yeast flakes . It has kind of a cheesy flavor . there are other brands that have less cals . this has 70 cals for 1 & 1/2 tablespoons .	1
Love it ! You can put it on anything really and the taste is great ! I use it for my Roads End mac and chreese as well as salads and zuchinni tacos .	1
I 've bought different popcorn oil and Wabash Valley Farms is the best . It 's just like getting fresh , hot movie theater popcorn . It does n't burn and has great flavor .	1
Give each kernel an all over buttery taste . Do n't forget the Flavacol , this is a must , for true popcorn taste .	1
Good oil makes all the difference when making popcorn at home . This oil makes any popcorn taste like it 's from the movie theater . I use it in my Popcorn Machine and it works great . I warm up the machine , add the oil and it melts fast and leaves a great flavor on the popcorn .	1
Great popcorn coconut oil . Buy the gallon size as this will not last long at all . These popcorn coconut oils make the best movie tasting popcorn you can get . Use a stir crazy pop corn maker .	1
I am forever sold on the coconut oil for the whirlipop along with some flavacol salt . I tend to buy the large industrial size jug since we make popcorn ALL THE TIME . But this is great also and will make a nice stocking stuffer for my popcorn lover family members .	1
Makes popcorn crunchy and gives it a good flavor , no need for butter . I use 2/3 popping oil and 1/3 safeflower oil.Popcorn comes out perfect .	1
Paired this with the Mushroom kernel popcorn popped out of a `` movie theater '' style popper in our office . What a difference this stuff makes ! ! I found warming a metal spoon under warm water or even the heating element of the popocorn machine helped with scooping the emulsion out of the jar and having it `` Release '' from the spoon . Once warm it just melts like regular oil.Very pleased ! !	1
Love this popcorn oil . It gives the popcorn so much flavor and a buttery look , as well . And , it smells like you 're in a theater ! I 'm probably one of few who still pops my own in a large pan on the stove ... .no microwaved stuff for me !	1
Tastes great , good color , pops corn the way it should . I will definately purchase again . It will be solid at room temperature because thats what coconut oil is . It 's not bad when it 's solid . Some people are paranoid that if it 's hard , it 's bad . That 's not the case with this stuff . Just get a spoon and dig it out .	1
This stuff is really great . It 's very messy but of course what oil is n't . I like to use a scoop and a spoon to avoid most of the mess , but liberal use of paper towels is still recommended to prevent getting oil over everything . It seems to thicken and thin depending on the temperature but this does n't effect the quality of the popcorn . Between this , good quality large kernels and some Flavacol salt , you get the best recreation of movie theater popcorn ( less the liquid butter stuff , but you can add that if you prefer ) . Popcorn comes out a perfect speckled golden color and has a nice butter flavor . Highly recommended .	1
I love this brand , all kernels pop and they are a nice size , texture and flavor .	1
This popcorn is our favorite for use in our whirly pop stove top popping kettle . Great taste and nice light kernels !	1
Pops fully , few spare kernels with the traditional stovetop method . Small , fluffy kernels , not a lot of 'misfires ' that are only partially evolved . My wife says they 're a tad too small for her taste , but the kids and I really love this popcorn .	1
you do n't get all that hull ( I think that 's what it is called ) because they are smaller . They go great with grapeseed Oil	1
split bad & cost with 2 friends so made it more affordable - little hulls if any - great as I have crowns - pops nice in my orville redenbacher microwave popper .	1
These kernels are small so they take a few more to get a full popped bowl and cooked with extra-virgin coconut oil results in supreme popcorn . Also there are very few hulls to get caught in your teeth ; a plus . Not everyone would agree but the popped corn is more tender and delicate than larger corn . I think regular yellow corn is the worse does n't come even close in quality and taste .	1
I have not eaten this popcorn or tasted it myself , it was part of a gift for my daughter in Grad School . She likes the fluffy quality of the popped corn and the not so many hulls - also the big bag makes her think she can make it last until Christmas ( that remains to be seen ) without having to buy more . A very good snack for a poor Grad Student	1
I bought a bowl to pop the corn in along with this popcorn . And put two handsful in the bowl and set the microwave on Popcorn . But it needed more popping for all to pop , in fact almost twice as much time . But the results are great.Today we will get the seasoning I bought for it and look forward to using it to have a woderful snack while watching TV .	1
this was recommended by a friend who said there was almost no & # 34 ; trash [ hulls , unexploded kernels , etc ] . & # 34 ; he was right ! also , just by the way , this popcorn is delicious	1
This is very high qulity pop corn , I recomend it . Almost all kernels pop and they are a crisp white when they pop . Very healthy and yummy , I have tried almost all of them .	1
Okay , maybe the heading exagerates just a tad ... Red Popcorn has a MUCH more tender husk than regular popcorn does and when it pops , it explodes the kernel so well that the husks basically disappear . When it pops , it looks pretty much like any other popcorn , except that the popped kernels are slightly smaller than usual . The meet is white , but you can see the little bits of red kernel in them . You would never know that the pretty , white popcorn you were eating started out red-colored if you had n't seen it before popping.The flavor is great ! It smelled `` toastier '' as it was popping than other popcorns we 've tried . We tried it all different ways , with toppings ranging from sweet to savory and every way was good.We also liked the fact that it is grown by Amish people and are happy to support their efforts to raise their crops the `` old way . '' They believe in sustainable farming and a clean , wholesome way of life . No ConAgra multi-national conglomerates here , just real , individual farmers making a living off their land.Great products raised and produced by real farmers . What better reasons do you need to buy some of this really tasty popcorn ! ?	1
Looks nearly black in the middle of the popped kernel , but it is n't burnt at all . Corn-ey taste , we 're really glad we 've found this seller and popcorn .	1
I was looking for a hulless popcorn ( due to my diverticulitis , boy do I miss popcorn ) and tried this based on the reviews . I was disappointed that this has way to many hulls for ME ( the hulls do not disappear or get so small ) but the flavor of the popcorn is amazing , very very tasty , my family loves it so I will buy it again . We air popped it , sprayed it with a little cooking oil and sprinkled some popcorn flavored seasoning `` butter . '' Hardly any calories but lots of taste : ) They are tiny when they pop so you really should not flood it with anything heavy or it will turn to mush .	1
This makes excellent popcorn . There are hardly any hulls and hardly any un-popped popcorn . The popcorn is nice and fluffy and tastes great !	1
I started ordering popcorn from Amazon because out local grocery stores only sell one brand of regular popcorn . Most of the popcorn they sell is microwave . Since there is only one to buy , there is no comparison price shopping and the stores seem to be taking advantage of this . This was very tasty popcorn . I tried many of the different Amish Country Brand popcorns . This was by far the best . The price is very reasonable even taking shipping into consideration .	1
I have been buying this popcorn for years , ever since I bought a whirling popper . Every kernal seems to pop and there are less husks to get caught in your teeth . It puffs into light and tasty morsels !	1
And I 've tried them all . Being a popcorn lover I 've tried quite a few different varieties and this is my current fav . Very few hulls , nice bright white and , most important , full of flavor.Very rarely an unpopped kernel . Good stuff .	1
this is great tasting popcorn its perfect tasting the only problem is in my air popper it doesnt pop all the kernals like your purple and baby white and yellow do this red kind pops about 75 % 3/4 of the kernals and leaves unpopped about 1/4 or 25 % thats too much wasted and i will buy the other kinds like the purple thats the best and pops over 90 % of the kernals with less than 10 % wasted i still recommend this though if you use another popping method im sure its perfect air popping is very different than stove top or microwaved so try it if you use those methods its delish !	1
Love this popcorn , just received my 2nd order , it pops great ... little to no hulls , which I really like ... also has a great taste , my family loves it also..	1
I have almost finished my first 12 pounds of this ! We air-pop these in an electric popper , and they come out perfect every time . They are not as large and rich as ordinary popcorn , but they can take more oil and butter before becoming soggy . This is important because we use these as a way to consume large amounts of fresh , unfiltered olive oil from Olive Leaf Hills , the only place I could find to order organic olive oil with a production date the company would admit to ! We also add walnut oil , macadamia oil , and sometimes coconut oil , avocado oil and other great oils.In addition to the oils and some salt , we add powdered garlic , cumin , curry , and sometimes hot Indian red pepper powder . This produces an amazingly tasty popcorn that is packed with antioxidant punch and other health benefits ! One reviewer panned this product for having bugs in it , and I also worried that after some time we might see bugs . I have n't yet , but I want to note that if you have bugs and they came from the producer on a non-organic product , at least you know it was n't irradiated ! The producer failed to respond to that customer , which is inexcusable , but that is not supposed to be covered in these reviews , but rather in the seller 's review . Of course , we do n't always read seller reviews , so sometimes it 's not a bad thing to see such complaints here.Another thing I noticed in the 1 star reviews is that people ca n't understand why some of us give it 5 stars when the kernels never pop . Then I noticed lots of `` unhelpful '' ratings of the bad reviews , what is up with that ? Obviously these kernels did n't work for several customers , and that is not `` unhelpful '' info ! As to the question of why they did n't pop , I do n't know . I used to pop these in a stainless steel pot ( from Amazon ) with rice bran oil ( from Amazon ) on a gas stove ( not from Amazon ) . That left some unpopped , but not a large number . I have popped other kinds of popcorn , including cheap stuff purchased both in the US and in grocery stores in China when I lived there . Ordinary cheap yellow popcorn will pop more easily and reliably , but it is not as strong in terms of adding butter and oils , and lacks the antioxidant value coming from the red color.I hope that helps explain how this is both a 5 star product and a 1 star product , depending upon the reviewer 's perspective . For me , it is a 5-star product.I will definitely buy these again .	1
I bought a bag of Wabash Blue , Wabash Vintage Red , and Bob 's Red MIll White , and popped them all in a Whirley Pop with a bit of oil . I liked Bob 's White the best , Wabash Blue 2nd , and Wabash Vintage Red 3rd . The Wabash Vintage Red and Blue were both pretty good , but I liked the taste of Bab ; s White more .	1
The taste was great and color of kernels unique . A bowl of popped corn looked quite interesting with the dark husks . The kernels were a bit smaller than most . I do n't know that I would buy again but this product makes a great gift and tastes good too .	1
I was hoping this was the kind of gourmet popcorn that makes huge fluffy , round kernels . It 's not . But it is a very good popcorn , almost good enough to eat without butter or salt . And it has the added benefit of having fewer little hulls to get stuck in your teeth . Incidentally , I 've been using it exclusively in a hot air popper .	1
It 's popcorn and it 's blue . What 's not to like ? Actually it does seem to pop up biger than the red , so I appreciated that . And the overall color , once popped , is different from the white so I like mixing them together .	1
I bought a bag of Wabash Blue , Wabash Vintage Red , and Bob 's Red MIll White , and popped them all in a Whirley Pop with a bit of oil . I liked Bob 's White the best and the Wabash Blue 2nd .	1
The taste was good and its interesting that its much smaller than what I usually have . Although I personally think that Trader 's Joe and Eden are big fluffy which I prefer	1
Amish Country Lady Finger popcorn is not hull free but we had to search to find any ! This product arrived quickly and well packaged . It is crisp with a mild flavor everyone seemed to enjoy . Anyone with dentures will appreciate this product , I should think .	1
This Amish Country Ladyfinger popcorn is subtle in taste . The size of the popped corn is quite small . I have yet to get a hull stuck in my teeth ; yes , there are still hulls on the corn but they are insignificant . For example , at the bottom of the bowl I see a few hulls . I touch them with my finger and they break apart/crumble . With regular popcorn the hulls are hard and have a sharp edge and they do not break or crumble when touched ... and they stick in my teeth . With the Ladyfinger popcorn they literally crumble and have no hard or sharp edges.The seeds are approximately 1/4 inch long . The Nutrition Facts on the bag say : 3 tablespoons , 110 calories , 1.5 g total Fat , 10 mg Sodium , 27g Carbs , and 4g Protein.There were no additional instructions/suggestions on how to prepare it . Personally , I like making my popcorn on the stovetop . I have used a method recommended by other popcorn : heat 1 tbsp oil in pot on high with 4 kernels , once the kernels pop lower heat to medium and add the rest of your kernels . Gently shake the pot every minute or so . Once the popping slows to 1-2 per second , turn off heat , continue to gently shake pot until all popping stops . Pour into bowl and season as desired . This method seems to produce the least amount of unpopped kernels as well as reduces the chance of burning the popcorn .	1
I liked it . I ca n't say I loved it , as it turns out I prefer bigger kernels and this one is small . But it 's a tasty one , especially if you prefer smaller kernels .	1
This stuff is pretty good . I would recommend it to anyone . It does wear out towards the end of the popping cycle .	1
I used this glaze many times and it is good . the coating properties could be better which is why it gets 4 out of 5. very addictive : - )	1
I used it in my whirly popper with some mushroom corn and it came out really good . You have to make sure the heat is down a little but I really ca n't find a thing to complain about . Did n't burn , was crisp after it cooled , good taste .	1
Good	1
Good fine , or actually extra fine salt for popcorn , nuts , vegetables or anything . Use sparingly , you will find you will not have to add quite as much and it distributes very well .	1
After trying 2 or three other Popcorn & Nut salts , this one is the best ! Other brands claim to be fine grain , but do n't do the job as well . And here you get a lot for your money .	1
Diamond Crystal Popcorn & Nut Salt . I eat a lot of popcorn and this is the best popcorn salt I 've use . Very fine . That being said , the packaging leaves a lot to be desired . The spinner that opens and closes is not connected and sits loosely atop the cannister . Also unlike in the past there is some clumping .	1
I make popcorns microwaving dry kernels ( without oil ) in a paper lunch bag . Then when they are done , I add salt.This salt , and most likely any salt , will not stick to the dry popcorns , however a tiny bit of oil or Pam spray is enough for it to stick well , and much better than a traditional salt.It also does not clump in the box , and a little goes a long way.Very satisfied and I will definitively purchase again .	1
Not as well as Morton 's or especially not as well as Flavacol , but it does work.This is a fairly versatile salt that can be used for any number of things , notjust popcorn or nuts . I mean serious , who buys `` Nut Salt '' right ? Thats what makesthis somewhat of a disappointment from a revered company like Diamond Crystal , causeIMO their Kosher Salt and sugar products are the best in the business.LMAO Now people are negging reviews for salt . ha ha	1
Heaven on earth ! I primarily use this on popcorn , but anything else that I added it to has been really good . In addition to particular uses for this very finally grained salt , I also use coarse salt for other things . Having a selection is a good idea and very nice when you 're expanding your cooking skills .	1
I use this to add salt to the Anne 's unsalted mixed nuts at Costco . This is the micro fine stuff with which most nuts are salted .	1
This is very , very finely ground salt ... it 's almost ... airy . But that makes it nice for popcorn because it coats more evenly . I oven roast my own nuts and seeds . I found this type of salt is so nice for the same reason as the popcorn use , even coating . Would recommend .	1
We love this fine salt for popcorn and french fries especially . If you own a popcorn popper , you must use coconut oil to pop and this salt !	1
I love this salt and use it on my french fries as well as on popcorn . It is not as good as fleur de sel or some of the other `` gourmet '' salts , but it is only 15 cents per ounce , not 15 dollars . Note that this salt is flaked , unlike the normal crystals for which Diamond Salt is known . It absolutely CLINGS to the surface of the popcorn , fries , and other similarly-textured foods MUCH better . It has a cleaner taste than some of the brown or grey sea salts and CLEAN is always good in my book.As a treat , I sometimes Iick the tip of my index finger , sprinkle a little of this on it , and then pretend like I 'm getting ready to do a mini tequilla shooter , but without the lime . Almost like a couple of hours on the beach.I can only give it four stars instead of five because it is NOT IODIZED and you could end up looking just like a frog with big goiter things on your neck if you do n't get enough iodine . This is not a problem for people who eat a lot of seafood , but if you live in the Midwest far from the ocean it could cause some difficulties .	1
this is so nice salt is so light actually flakey great for home made popcorn , cant wait to use this	1
I love popcorn salt- It flavors evenly and I feel like I can sprinkle on less since it gives everything such a fine coating . This was a great deal in a large quantity !	1
I had bought a cool Tupperware type thing to make popcorn in the microwave a few months ago and no one in my family was ever remembering to make popcorn for a snack . So I bought this salt and a . Couple other flavored salts and arranged them in a prominent place on the counter . My husband and kids very much like this brand of popcorn and nut salt and now they are making popcorn a lot !	1
Best salt for popcorn . Use it sparingly . I kept an old Reese popcorn salt shaker to refill from this large container .	1
We have some food sensitivities in our household , so we can not use flavorcol due to the Yellow 5 ( Tartrazine , a known migraine trigger ) . Although it 's not as good as flavorcol for popcorn , it is as close as we can get in our house .	1
It seemed expensive , but it really is worth it when you are eating popcorn without loads of butter , but the salt stays on anyway . I makes air popped corn that much better	1
I bought this for our home during the holidays but we 're eating it now . It 's very good and I might buy more soon .	1
These candies are wonderful . They are really rich and melt in your mouth , with a crunchy almond and toffee center . The danger is that they 're really easy to eat . I often have 5 or 6 of these at a time before I 've realized how many calories that is.They 're very popular in the Chinese-American community as gifts , especially around Lunar New Year . They 're made in Tacoma , Washington and if you 're traveling abroad , they make excellent souvenirs if you want to give something made in the USA ( very few things are these days ) . Almond Rocas are exported all over the world and I found them in Japan at the gourmet import store ( but very pricey ) . They 're also popular in Hong Kong . I 've never seen anyone who does not like these ! I paid $ 30 for 2 boxes ( each 21 ounces ) at my local grocery store . This tin is $ 22 for the same amount of candy , and sold directly by Brown & Haley , the manufacturers . That 's a fantastic deal ! I wish I had bought mine here.Nutrition information from the side of the box : 3 pieces is 200 calories , 130 of which is from fat ( 15g ) . Cholesterol : 15mg , Sodium : 115mg .	1
Whenever I 'm stuck for a gift for my wife , nothing beats 2 1/2 pounds of Almond Roca . And I 'll give her more credit : much as she loves this toffee treat , she has one for dessert after dinner , and that 's it . If I were to sit down with this , it would n't last a week . If you 've never tried Almond Roca , but love toffee , then you 've got to get the original `` mini '' chocolate and nut covered toffee . If they only sold self-control !	1
How can anyone not like these ? For some reason , people like to give chocolate as gifts . I do n't know why because taste is a very personal thing and you never know what people like . We usually re-gift Russell 's or See 's but I like really Almond Rocas . First of all they 're all individually wrapped so it 's not like you feel you have to finish a can quickly when you open it . Then , there 's the taste , there 's a layer of nuts on the outside , then chocolate , then crunchy caramel on the inside . I suppose you can melt this in your mouth but I always crunch it . It 's not overly sweet which is a major plus and they say nuts and chocolate are good for your health so that 's two major positives.This is a 42oz can so it 's mainly for aficionados , but the great thing is , if you 've never tried this before you can go to your local drug store and chances are they 'll sell a small pack of these for you to try . It 's great , because they only used to sell this in one size , but now they sell it in small packets to large tins like this . And tins like this are great as gifts , especially for dentists ! Lastly , the tins are great and you can keep them in your pantry for putting things in . All in all , a great product in great packaging .	1
I love Almond Roca . Unfortunately , the price at Amazon is over twice what it is at Costco , $ 10.79 . I buy a lot from Amazon , as long as the prices are reasonable . Do your homework , Amazon 's price for this item is outrageous .	1
You will always find these in Chinatown because Chinese people and Filipino people love these , and why not ? So buttery is the toffee ! The little nutty covering feels funny on your tongue and I think they just put it there to keep the toffee from being sticky as it does not contribute much to the overall flavor . These are not the deformed ones that they sell cheap -- each one is beautiful and perfectly-formed . Buy a can for yourself and any Chinese or Filipino friends you have , and even for your girlfriend for Valentine 's -- the pink tin practically SHOUTS `` Happy Valentines Day , I love you like a little toffee candy ! ! ! ! ! ''	1
I 'm a toffee nut . At Christmastime , my wife bought a 28oz can of these for me and they lasted all of about , oh , one week . So I reordered , this time getting the monster 42oz container , which sits on my desk awaiting that precious moment at the end of the day when I snatch one from the can , unwrap the foil and experience toffee-induced nirvana.It 's hard to find toffee in America . You wo n't find it in every candy section , and if you do , it 's likely to be junk . I 'm grateful to find this online and I think that any toffee lover is going to be quite pleased .	1
A R is one of my favorite convections , so when I found it here in a large container for a great price , I could n't resist.This is soooooooo good you 'll find yourself having too much at one sitting . GET SOME !	1
What can I say ? Almond Roca has been around for years and this can was just as good as all the previous ones . When I order it I always know what to expect and it never disappoints . Treat yourself to a can . Fall will be here soon and a couple of these candies with a cup of coffee in front of the fire ? Oh , yeah .	1
No one makes a product like this . It is a one of a kind candy . It is awesome and has been for as many years as I can remember . I do n't even regularly eat candy , but I love it . But , my 89 year old mother has loved this for all of my lifetime and I am 63 . She get 's this every year from me for Christmas .	1
Love the candy and the price was really good for the size of canister and the amount . The expiration date is good for nearly a year from now so I can enjoy eating alittle here and alittle there .	1
hard to tell if its going anything ... . : ) guess I will use it more to see . I may start looking at the brewers DME to see if it works as it seems cheaper	1
Well I have always been on a quest for that loaf of bread that matches what my grandmother used to make . Reading about how this might move me one step closer I purchased it with some hope it would help but not really confident it would make that much of a difference.Well I made my first batch and I am not sure how or why but everything came out incredibly well . I made some loafs of bread and some bagels . Both tasted great and certainly a step above my average results . I am sure that this amount will last for a good while so the cost is not all that great and I think the result is certainly worth the expense .	1
Essential ingredient for making my breads . Until I found this malt I had to substitute brown sugar , not any more !	1
Adding a little bit of this into bread can help the end product quite a bit . I had a very hard time finding this product in stores , so it was great to see a huge amount for a very low price here . You can definitely tell the difference in the end product , and it worked wonderfully on the croissants I made .	1
After reading some positive reviews and recommendations from places like King Arthur Flour , I decided to give this bread add-in a try . I was skeptical a tablespoon or too would make a difference in my bread but it does seem to increase shelf life and slightly soften texture of all the loaves and rolls I 've tried it with so far ( sourdough , sweet rolls , dinner rolls ) . There is no distinct taste difference but the dough gets ( much ) easier to work with after the addition and it even seems to boost the rise a bit.Not an essential bread-making tool , but if you make from-scratch loaves a few times a week , like I do , a tiny , yet worthwhile investment and great addition to your pantry . A pretty good , overall `` secret '' ingredient .	1
I use this in my home-made breads , but I have n't noticed a difference between this product andthe malt I make from sprouted wheat berries .	1
I got this to use in a bread recipe that calls for powdered milk . I 've tried the recipe with and without powdered milk and the recipe is serious : powdered milk really helps the rise . This product works as well as the popular ( and way more expensive ) brand of non-instant I 'd been using , and I will definitely be purchasing this brand again when I run out . It tastes good as well in uses such as milk gravy and from-scratch macaroni & cheese , though it is , again , not instant -- so it does n't dissolve the same way . Lumps must be carefully attended .	1
I was not sure when I saw the & # 34 ; non-instant & # 34 ; description of this product . I will be trying it shortly to create some cheese based dishes and I think it will certainly help me get those done in a dried venue for future use .	1
Love the convience of the powdered milk . Does not spoil , but once opened it has to be put in a tightly sealed container . I sure wish the company would do that to make it easier for the buyers Long shelf life and great to use in an emergency when you do n't have whole milk on hand .	1
The milk tastes very good though ; however , the bag is much smaller than one would think a pound would be .	1
This is such an amazing deal . I make bread all the time and this has come in so handy . Its fresh and works very well . I opened one package and put it in a glass jar with a lid and put it in my ice box is it 's always there when I need it . You will not be sorry for buying this item ! ! ! ! I will buy again and again ! ! ! !	1
I sure wish this came in a jar instead of a bag . Most of this had spilled all over the box and I ended up with very little to use . The bags see fragile . This is great in baking . Better than having to go buy a pint of buttermilk to use in a recipe and the rest go bad .	1
I have n't tried this yet I gave most of it as a gift but have heard so many good things about it and the supplier really was excellent at shipping it out to me quickly .	1
We do n't drink buttermilk but love it for cooking , such as buttermilk pancakes , sour dough breads , and anything else I can think of to put it in .	1
I purchased this for baking purposes and because I rarely use buttermilk to purchase it fresh . I have used it now in several baked goods and it is very good . Will purchase again when needed . For those who do n't know how much to use , it is 4 tablespoons of powder per 8oz of water for a cup .	1
I do n't use buttermilk in a lot of recipes , so I do n't usually keep it in stock in liquid form . I do use it from time to time , and so it is very handy to have it in powder form so that I can store it until I need it . I 'll be buying this again .	1
Some in my family are allergic to various artificial food colors , but my kids really did n't want a white birthday cake cause it is boring . Beet powder is the perfect coloring for us . I simply mix it with a small amount of hot water , let it sit a minute , then strain through cheesecloth . I then use the liquid in making my frosting and it is a beautiful bright pink color -- prettier than standard food coloring IMO , and a perfect color for little girls ' birthdays . I have also just added the powder directly to the frosting , which works but it takes a while for the color to appear full strenth and if you look closly you will see tiny dots of beet powder.I also use beet powder to make colored sugar , pouring a tiny amount of liquid on sugar , mixing well , letting it dry , and breaking up any clumps . I then use that sugar to make homemade peeps that the whole family can eat ( recipe at [ ... ] Mine do n't look nearly as good as Martha 's , but they tase wonderful.I have even used beet powder to make candy canes ( recipe at [ ... ] Instead of adding food coloring , just add some beet liquid AFTER taking the candy off the heat and cooling slightly . I have also used it in other hard candies , the only problem is that if the candy hardens before you have shaped it you ca n't reheat it on the stove or the beet stuff will burn , turn brown , and taste nasty . That only happens at very high temperatures , however . You can add beet powder to baked goods without burning it.This stuff goes a long way as a food coloring . One small package has lasted us a year and a half , using it a couple of times a month , and I am just now nearly done with it . No one has ever noticed a beet flavor in the finished products because you only need a tiny amount .	1
I have been using all natural foods as much as possible for many years . I buy presitive free , artifical color and flavoring free foods . Since this is not always possible , esp . with baked goods , I make my own . The kids get tired of plain white icing so this is great . I made cupcakes for Valentines Day and used this to make pink frosting . The kids were delighted !	1
very easy to use . taste great . mixes very easily with smoothies . will be purchasing again as soon as supply depleted .	1
I 'm trying to get away from artificial colors , and I wanted to deeply color some poached apples- this was ideal ! I love this stuff . I 'll definitely buy more .	1
I tried to make a homemade lipstick , but it came sheer . I wanted a bright color , but unfortunately it did not work .	1
This is a fairly good product especially if you want a little more 'kick ' to your pickled beet eggs making . It adds more flavor and color to the pickled beet eggs . Also , I use them in my smoothie . I am not sure if it help for enzyme therapy or just makes it look red . For natural red food coloring , this product is great .	1
I bought a bunch of the powder from the company for soups . I am very happy . It seems high quality .	1
Delicious and well worth the cost . Delivered on time and as agreed . A versatile product I can use on many things including sandwiches , fish and meats .	1
ohhhh ... this stuff is WONDEFUL ! ! ! Nothing else is quite like it . The exquisite flavor not only adds to any mouthful of food but also wakes up the flavors of everything else you 're eating . Best mustard to go with prime beef . Best mustard for sandwiches with lean meats , lettuce and fresh sprouts . Best mustard with crackers and gourmet cheese ( or , hey , just with crackers ! ) . A little goes a long way , and you feel coddled whenever you have some.We used to live near a gourmet food store where we could buy this whenever we ran out . We got spoiled , and now it 's VERY hard to find . So great to see it on Amazon -- wow ! ! ! !	1
Ok , *this* is real mustard . ; - ) This is what you want when you 're having something special : mustard with the seed .	1
I love this mustard . It 's perfectly grainy and has a nice hit of vinegar . I use it from salad dressings to sauces .	1
Now my wife and mother-in-law are addicted too . Great for cooking not just for smearing . Larger size is much more economical . Appreciate that .	1
I did n't know what to expect when I ordered this jar of pommery Mustard and was surprised when I tried it to see the consistency of the spread . It looks like a mustard that has n't been ground up [ completely . Okay , if I had read up about it I probably would have known that the name tells it all . There are always consequences for your actions , sometime good and sometimes bad . This time I was lucky , this mustard is great on a sandwich . I love the stone jar . '	1
In my opinion this is the best and only seasoning to buy for jerking your meats , it is spicy , easy to use and the absolute authentic jerk seasoning I will swear by . I have used this on all types of chicken and some other meats , I would not reccomend this for fish , unless you are going to pan sear the fish , fish is too delicate for this , try their marinade instead . This seasonig is not for the faint of heart , it is very hot and spicy just the way i like it . Try this only if you like your food hot and spicy , the seasoning works very well on the grill .	1
Bust out the napkins , grab yourself a beer , and buckle your seat belts cause this stuff is a properauthentic flamefest of Jamaican jerk heat . You can put it on straight , or cut it with a little oliveoil , but I 've found it best to marinate chicken or pork tenderloins for at least 24 hours before cooking for optimum results.Its a little messy cause you really have to rub this stuff in and make sure you turn/shake your marinade bag every few hour to ensure an even distribution of this wondermous stuff . If you 're not using rubber gloves , make sure you wash your hands and I would n't plan on rubbing your eyes or doing anything else to sensitive body parts for a while . haw hawThis stuff is the best , followed closely by Grace Jerk Seasoning but Walkerswood does n't turn your chicken green like the Grace rub does . 5 Pods	1
I have never been to Jaimaica so am not trying to compare what the locals make . Mainly comparing to Bush Brown 's as that is my go to up to now . Thought I would try this for a change of pace . I find the heat to be similar . This had a slightly different smell that was not as pleasant for some reason . Maybe it was the allspice . I will update my review as I use up the jar.It is thick and looks to be of good quality ingredients . Came with a best by of Feb 2017 so definitely fresh . So far used it on a pork roast grilled on the bbq marinated overnight . Only needed about two tablespoons for the 4 lb roast so the jar will last quite a while . Looking forward to BBQ chicken next.I May have to get a jar of Busha 's to do a side by side and to compare ingredients.I would not deter anyone from using this over Busha 's .	1
This is great seasoning . I have used it on pork and chicken and both times it turned out great . This is one of the most authentic seasonings I have found . I have not been able to locate it in stores , so I may need to buy in bulk . It does not seem overly spicy to me , but I like spicy food , so for others it may seem like a little too much .	1
I am going to avoid gushing superlatives because all of the good ones have been used in other reviews . Instead I want to extol the virtues of this blend on fish . Specifically on salmon . Do n't get me wrong - I am sure it 's wonderful on meat , but I do not indulge in that.When I prepare this I hand coat the fish with a thin layer of olive oil , then rub in this seasoning . I let it sit overnight and - viola ! - the flavors have married deeply with the fish and come out beautifully when grilled or broiled . This is definitely spicy . If you have an aversion to hot food you may want to try theWalkerswood Jamaican Mild Jerk Seasoninginstead . It has the same basic flavor profile , but without the piquant element.It 's the flavor profile that not only sets this apart , but also captures the flavor of authentic Jamaican jerk . The piquant element is strictly from the Scotch bonnet peppers , which are both hot and flavorful . There is a touch of sweet from the cane sugar that is complemented by some of the aromatic spices ( allspice and nutmeg . ) In fact , the flavor profile is very complete because there is a touch of bitterness from the nutmeg , and sour from the citric acid . Salt is also prominent in the profile , with 540mg per two teaspoon serving . The final savory components come from the spring onion , black pepper and thyme.This is for much more than jerk barbeque though . Walkerswood provided a tip that I followed - mix a little of this into mayonnaise - that makes a perfect condiment . In fact it complements aioli ( a French twist on mayonnaise ) . However , I digress . This is probably the best jerk mix for making authentic jerk , and can be used to 'spice ' up other dishes and condiments in ways only limited by your imagination .	1
Excellent flavor , and , ... ..spontaneous combustion heat ! ! ! You do n't have to use a lot to get a great 'jerk ' effect . I was a bit surprised that this was actually a paste-like product , instead of the dry seasonings I had previously purchased , but that 's what refrigerators are for .	1
this is the only jerk seasoning that i likecareful with the usage because the allspice is potenti love the amount of heat in it as well	1
My husband loves this tea and says it tastes like chocolate . I disagree . I think it tastes like black licorice which is not good . Since I bought it for my husband , I will rate it accordingly .	1
Really , I was expecting a matte slap in the face , so I was pleasantly surprised . While mate still is n't my top flavor pick , it melded nicely in this blend . I took a sip straight to get a baseline flavor and was greeted with a mild sweetness , a relatively mellow tea , and the faintest hint of cocoa and spices.Following the instructions , I added a bit of almond milk ( which I discovered can curdle a bit ) , but opted to skip the extra sweetener . While still good , I actually liked it better without milk added . Though I am not a latte drinker , and have had some less than stellar experiences with mate , this tea gets the thumbs up.I marked just one star down , as the price is quite exorbant for a relatively inexpensive tea .	1
I love this tea , the flavor is great ! I buy this brand at Trader Joe 's and pay $ 4.69 a box . I did n't really read the description of this tea , I was in a hurry . I presumed it was a 3 box purchase for $ 14.61 , not one box ! Trader 's does n't carry this chocolate flavor , so I will enjoy this purchase , but ca n't afford to make another one ! ! !	1
I really love this tea . I should start out and say that I , like most , kind of secretly expected this tea to taste like maybe hot chocolate or to have a real chocolate taste . It does not . It tastes like tea with some spices is all . It has maybe a hint of cocoa , but it 's not the full on chocolate taste people are going to expect . So keep this in mind before sipping , or you 'll get a little disappointed . It 's a really mild tea , no bitterness at all , and it has a great scent and flavor . It even wakes me up and gives me a bit of energy in the morning . I took off one star because of the price , I wish it were a little cheaper . Overall I recommend anyone try this .	1
This tea is delicious , gives you a nice energy boost , and is also a mild appetite suppressant , making a good choice for your afternoon break .	1
I love the Guayaki brand and had seen the chocolatte flavor online but never in stores until my last trip to Mother 's Market ( where it was on sale for 4.19 , regularly 6.49 . ) I 'm glad I picked it up , it 's a great tea , great flavor , no sweetener needed but it tastes closer to chai to me than it does chocolate . I add a tablespoon of organic cacao powder and some organic vanilla almond milk to make it a `` dessert tea . ''	1
I have recently begun drinking yerba mate teas . I was surprised that they really do help me in the mornings without the nervous effects that can come with the caffeine of coffee . I have always loved chocolate and have been limited because of diabetes so this is a good way for me to sip and enjoy my chocolate . I have to use this one very sparingly because of its expense but it is a treat for me . I add a little half-n-half ( or fat free half-n-half ) and some Stevia and I enjoy every moment of drinking this tea.This particular blend includes several other spices , I would guess maybe it is chai , and when I open the box I am almost positive that I smell black pepper . I wish they made this in a loose tea form . When I am going to have it I do tear open the tea bag and pour the leaves into my steeper to get the full effect . Do n't expect this to taste like chocolate milk , you will be disappointed . The flavor is unique as is the consistency . Without the sweetener it 's not as flavorful for me . I have stashed some of this at the top of the cupboard to keep as my comfort drink on a day when I just need an emotional lift .	1
Great tea . Delicious chocolate fix in the morning , and helps greatly with mental clarity in place of coffee . Brews a little weak , so if your mug is big , let steep a little longer or use two bags . Water needs to be hot , but just short of boiling . It does n't steep well in boiling water .	1
Never had mate before but am usually a big fan of spiced chai . This is christmas in a cup . I love the hints of cocoa , cinnamon , cardamom and warm spices , with just a touch of sweetness . It smells heavenly . Just what I needed to wean myself off coffee .	1
THIS TEA IS GOOD , BUT IN MY OPINION I LIKE THE PLAIN YERBA MATE TEA BETTER . WILL NOT ORDER AGAIN .	1
This drink is delicious ! But beware - it 's overpriced on Amazon . I found the exact same product at my local Whole Foods for $ 6.79 .	1
The flavor and scent of this is wonderful ! It 's smooth , yet has a cinnamon spice to it . I feel so great after a cup , it 's a great pick me up in the afternoon .	1
THIS IS THE BEST TEA EVER ! IT IS ALSO PERFECT TO USE WITH THE HCG DIET ! ! ! I LOVE THIS STUFF ! ! !	1
I am already a fan of Organic Yerba Mate Tea 25 Bags and a fan of chocolate . This mix is the best of yerba mate with just a hint of chocolate . If you are looking for a more milk-chocolate flavor , try it with a little sweetener and milk . The hint of chocolate gives this yerba mate a more bitter flavor closer to coffee than the plain yerba matte but without the coffee acid and reduced caffeine . Yerba mate is a good flavor in itself and not just as a coffee substitute . The chocolate gives us yerba mate fans some variety in flavors .	1
I like this product best mixed with another tea ( like raspberry or chai ) , that offsets its earthy sock-like ( but not unpleasant ! ) flavor.I really like the way it makes me feel . Not jacked up and jittery like coffee or Red Bull , but a smooth energy and yes , more endurance throughout the day . Good with some raw honey too ( put the raw honey in the cup before pouring in the hot water to dissolve it . )	1
A delicious and effective mild brain stimulant , Yerba Mate is a South American tradition spreading through the US market as an alternative to the caffeine bomb drinks that flood the market under the `` energy drink '' category . what I affectionally call the `` twitchy seizure '' category - Red Bull , Monster , etc . ) Note : there is a substantial amount of information on the internet ( take that for what it 's worth ) that suggests that prolonged excessive use of Yerba Mate can lead to some significant health risks . Not sure if there 's any truth to that or not ... probably best to enjoy in moderation anyway ... which is what I would recommend for coffee and all the caffeine bomb drinks too . Let your daily morning pickup be a nice hot cup of camellia sinensis - plain black tea , enjoyed around the world by people that live healthier longer lives than us Yanks .	1
I love this blend of yerba mate and tea . Guayaki makes great products , and I ca n't get enough of this blend . I do wish they had a version of this in the loose leave packaging though .	1
THIS STUFF IS GREAT ! IT IS GREAT TO USE IT WITH THE HCG DIET AS WELL ! ! TASTES GOOD ! HOWEVER , THE CHOCOLATE IS MY FAVORITE FLAVOR !	1
Used this to create a birthday cake for my Black mouth cur : ) ! We love her very much and wanted something special for her birthday . We used this for chocolate flavor and it is great ! I used it in brownies to try it for myself . It is very good and healthier !	1
I use carob powder in every recipe that calls for cocoa . I especially love it in my morning protein shake that I make with hempseeds , hemp protein , chia seeds and almond milk.I rated it 4 stars instead of 5 because it does n't taste any different to me than carob that is dark roasted . I thought it would have a less & # 34 ; carob & # 34 ; flavor , but that 's not the case . But it is good tasting . I do prefer raw carob , although it is too expensive , so I will continue to buy the light roast .	1
Like a lot of other products by Barry Farms , I was first introduced to carob powder way back during my sons scouting days . Camping trips during the fall and winter months always resulted in the evening ending with a traditional `` jawin '' session around the fire , complete of course with hot cocoa and marshmallows , among other treats . In the beginning , real hot chocolate was used for it was easy to locate , and of course what the boys wanted and expected . The biggest problem we had with the real thing was the obvious caffeine high it used to give the boys late at night when we least wanted it . ( As any of you with youngin 's in your household can imagine , most kids do n't need the bountiful effects of caffeine at any time , but especially late at night ) . After the traditional session around the campfire ended , a not so well liked and substandard other tradition would unfortunately follow . Trying to get the well wired boys to settle down and let the old men and ladies on the trip get some much needed rest.Enter carob powder . Carob is a tropical pod that contains a sweet dark pulp that is very similar in taste and texture to cocoa . The pulp is dried and then ground into a powder that both appears and tastes similar to chocolate . It used to be something only available in health food stores . But now with the advent of the internet , it is widely available here and other places online . Despite carob powder being very similar to chocolate in calories and fats , it is nonetheless a healthier alternative . It contains three times the calcium found in chocolate , and more importantly to me , unlike chocolate it contains no caffeine . This was the true benefit we had in mind in substituting it for the cocoa at trails end each night . Make no mistake about it , carob is a little sweeter , but definitely not as flavorful as real chocolate ounce for ounce . Anyone expecting hot chocolate will be disappointed by a straight mug of carob . It 's not only not as tasty , but it remains a little grittier as well when dissolved . Surprisingly however , my experience back in my sons scouting days proved that the boys got used to the carob powder very quickly , and actually enjoyed its little grittier texture . As for its flavor , straight carob brewed hot reminded a lot of the scouts of Yoo Hoo drink . Anyone familiar with the taste of Yoo Hoo can easily imagine carobs flavor . Even if we decided to spike the carob powder with a little real chocolate , we were still giving the boys a healthier drink , and of course a lot less caffeine . We went through quite a few pounds of it in my sons younger days . With very few complaints or disappointment.In conclusion , I highly recommend carob powder for anyone that prefers a little healthier alternative drink to real hot chocolate , and without any of the caffeine . Or , if you just happen to be one of those poor unfortunates that is allergic to chocolate . I still today buy it from Barry Farms and take it along on my own hikes here for I am so used too , and have taken a liking to its flavor over the years . If you decide to give it a try , I recommend buying two or more pounds at a time to make the shipping a better deal . The Barry Farms carob is a very good quality product , and has been around for many years.PS : By the way , like some of the other reviewers here , I recommend the regular or light carob powder over the dark brewed blend also available on Amazon . Carob is not like chocolate in that it gets sweeter and stronger when roasted a bit longer . In my opinion and that of others here , it just gets more bitter and less pleasant by the lengthier process ...	1
Well packaged , fast shipping . This item was something I wanted a small amount on hand for those times my recipes call for carob . Am thinking about ordering another one .	1
I add it to my smoothies . It does not have caffeine so it 's a good choice other than cacao . Would buy again .	1
For those few of us who never eat chocolate , these are the ideal substitute . I use them in baking as well as straight out of the bag .	1
My son is allergic to chocolate and I found these . He says they are very good and he loves having & # 34 ; chocolate chips & # 34 ; again . I am allergic to carob so I can not taste them and give my review . I am going off of what he says : ) He gives them 5 stars . ( He is 14 )	1
I 've been buying these carob chips for years . No other chips compare . These are just the right amount of sweetness & mimic chocolate ! They 're great for baking in place of choc chips but also good to at by themselves , out of the bag ! Also , the customer service is great , the folks at Barry Farms are awesome !	1
I purchased these as we try to avoid white sugar . I do n't know if I would purchase again due to the cost and after more research it does n't seem the small amount we use is significant in our overall eating .	1
Great price for these . They taste great in all my cookies and breads . Would definately buy again and suggest to a friend to buy .	1
Ca n't find this is your average grocery store . Has so many uses , not only in baking , but in facials , and any use where you do n't want the usual components of egg yolks . It has no shelf life limit and no additives . It is a really superior product .	1
Powdered egg whites are the greatest things since sliced bread ... : - ) I never wait for the powder to dissolve . Place the water in a narrow container , put a spring whisk in the water and start the plunging action as you add the powder . The powder never gets a chance to reach and stick to the bottom of the container and you have perfectly smooth egg whites within seconds .	1
I use this for a weekly facial to nourish and my skin . I like that you can control exactly how much you make . I bought a whisk so that I could mix the powder and water thoroughly . I use warm water to better mix the powder and this works great on my skin .	1
The Egg White Powder , 8 oz . arrived ahead of schedule , was packaged well , and is as was described . I have been busy with the holidays and will report on my attempts at making meringue from egg white powder and Atkins Oopsie bread shortly .	1
Easy way to add protein to gluten free baking . I mix it in with the dry ingredients and add the water to the wet ingredients . Egg whites help with the rising of yeast breads without changing the flavor !	1
I got this as a substitute for fresh eggs or liquid egg white because I do n't use those fast enough . It takes some practice to make actual egg-on-the-plate dishes , but as a dry ingredient , it 's great ! I made a portable pancake mix for my son to take camping , and it was a hit . I amended the ratio to 2 TBLS to make a full egg in volume ( although not fat ) .	1
I have only used this product with pancake mix , but it works great for that . The mix I use is 1/3 cup per serving but calls for one egg per cup . This product works great to make a single serving and does n't impart an & # 34 ; off & # 34 ; taste at all , in addition to being more convenient .	1
These are not WWII powdered eggs but they still do n't do as well as freeze dried eggs as eggs for cooking egg dishes . For anything needed eggs in the recipe , they are great I will get a several more packages of them as these are the best brand I have found . For breakfast of eggs I will get some freeze dried and some chicks for my farm	1
Most people that buy powdered eggs tend to use them in recipes as a replacement for real eggs . My introduction to instant eggs was not so indiscreet . I first tasted them on a camping trip with my sons scout troop quite a few years ago . It was late spring and getting warmer so we were concerned about bringing real eggs along . We had the `` Honeyville '' brand that is available here on Amazon as well . I found them to be surprisingly good scrambled . In fact when done right they seemed indiscernible to me in respect to real eggs . Same texture and flavor . I decided to buy more powered eggs years later when I started to do more numerous hikes that took me further out into the wilderness , and I found myself missing the taste of eggs over an open fire . Being the frugal gourmet that I am I opted to try the Barry Farm egg powder over the Honeyville for it was a bit cheaper . Not only that , but I already owned and have used Barry Farms chicken and beef bouillon powder for quite some time and found them both to be excellent in soups and stews . I am pleased to announce that my being a tightwad this time around was very well placed , and rewarded . The Barry farm egg powder taste very good when prepared right . I make them here at home as scrambled quite often . And as a recipe substitute I find they are undetectable as to be compared to real eggs . They are most definitely just as good as the Honeyville brand . ( Although in all fairness , I have noticed lately that Barry Farm is just about the same price now as the Honeyville . I still prefer the taste of Barry Farm ) . The only suggestion I would make to anyone that wishes to be adventurous and make scrambled eggs with this powder is make sure you grease the pan well . They stick something awful if you do n't , just like real eggs . There will always be a core amount of folks that would never attempt cooking or tasting powdered eggs either scrambled or in a recipe . For those that fit into that category do n't bother to get adventurous now . For those of you that have tasted these before , or are tempted to taste them now , I highly recommend Barry Farm egg powder . They 're nowhere near as bad , or the same powdered eggs soldiers used to tell horror stories about when talking about the cuisine of their war years ...	1
I do n't like the packaging it came it . I wish it would have come in a jar . Had to put in plastic container as these packs are not recloseable . But as far as the product itself , it was great . Great egg taste . Used some of this in a cake recipe and it turned out as if I had used a fresh egg . These keep for a long time , so that is great . Great to keep on shelf for emergencies .	1
WWhile in the military we hade these all the time one kind of gets used to it not for the beginner think ing eggs fresk they are not with a little cheese powdwe and some ketchup your on your way .	1
If someone is baking a lot with yeast it is worth buying this large size . The yeAst is effective , makes the dough rise well , and it is economical . I freeze large amount , keep handy small portion in refrigerate for daily use.It can keep a long time is such a way .	1
When using King Arthur unbleached flour , this is the yeast their recipies are designed around . If used correctly and according to the KA bread recipies , this is a no fail product . The only yeast I use .	1
It showed up right on schedule and works a lot better than the grocery store stuff . I especially like how you can just mix it in the flour dry and it works fine that way , no proofing the yeast .	1
SAF yeast has been a long time favorite of mine . It was once available locally at health food stores and supermarkets but I 've been unable to find any in the last few years . I 'm very happy to see that Amazon now has it available as an add-on at a super bargain price . It can be bought in either a single one-pound bag or in a package of four one-pound bags . While I bake a lot of bread , I 've just been buying the single bags and they last through many loaves . Right now Amazon charges $ 7.65 for the single one-pound bags . That is significantly cheaper than Fleishman 's and Red Star bought locally for $ 5.00-6.00 in the 4 oz jars . I keep the unused yeast in their original bags inside Ziploc freezer bags stored in the freezer . For frequent daily use , I put some SAF in a Fleishman 's yeast jar I kept from previous use and I keep this in the refrigerator . This has proven to be a reliable method in keeping this yeast fresh.Other than the excellent price here on Amazon , SAF is an outstanding yeast . It 's very forgiving of the imprecise baker . I mostly use a bread machine and I do measure the ingredients , however , I 'm not dogmatic about it and I will add a little extra or a little less of some ingredients as the spirit moves me . When using some other brands of yeast , I occasionally had minor failures . Usually this involved the bread rising too swiftly and then cratering in the center or when using 100 % whole wheat flour , sometimes the loaves were a bit on the dense side . With only minimal attention to detail , this does n't happen to me with SAF yeast . Bread made with this yeast rise beautifully into consistently sturdy loaves.I do not detect any off-tastes to bread made with SAF but I never found any off-tastes to bread made with other brands of yeast either.I 've read some reviews of bread machines and bread ingredients in which the reviewers say one MUST use a particular brand of flour to make a good loaf of bread . To that I say , `` Horsefeathers ! '' Bread and all purpose flours are milled to such universal consistency around the country that it 's hard to find a poor product . If you have special needs such as a medical condition or you 're concerned with only using organic products , that 's a different subject and altogether outside the scope of this review.Bottom line here is that SAF is as good a bread yeast as you will find and Amazon 's price is a bargain .	1
ive baked a good 5 loaves with this including some brioche . turns out great everytime . would order again , except its going to take me forever to get through this purchase .	1
I have used this yeast for making bread in my bread machine and also for making home made artisan bread and pizza . I have achieved good and consistent results across the board . 16 ounces is a lot of yeast but I still use it quickly enough . I keep it in the brown glass yeast jars from previous yeast purchases and/or vacuum seal bags in the freezer until I am ready to use more .	1
I keep part of it in the fridge and the rest in a jar in the freezer . I looked at several websites and they stated this method works well . I bought it here on Amazon but you can buy it from your local Costco or other big retailer cheaper but too late .	1
I make all of my own bread , so I go through a lot of yeast ! I just laugh at the tiny packets and jars supermarkets tend to stock . This one-pound bag lasts a good long while . I keep some in a jar in the fridge , and the rest sealed in a bag in the freezer to replenish the jar as needed . It seems like really good yeast -- it does n't have to be proofed but can go straight into baked goods ' dry ingredients . And the results with SAF are consistent , unlike with other yeasts . I used to have trouble with bread not rising sometimes when it seemed like I 'd done everything right . With SAF , if you follow the same steps , you will get the same results . And that matters a lot to me .	1
I agree with the other reviewers who noted that there was some misinformation about this being compressed yeast by someone who had n't opened the bag yet . ( grin ) Just like some coffee bags have all the air sucked out which makes the bags feel brick hard until you open them at which time the grains flow smoothly ... this is no different . It 's done that way to make this yeast MORE fresh than those bagged with air still trapped inside which , of course , breaks down the yeast . This packaging is a good thing.I have a friend with a bread machine who noticed that I am into handmade homemade bread now ... I 'm whipping through bread recipes from two cookbooks a couple times a week and enjoying the freshness of homemade bread . Because one of the authors of my bread cookbook won the highest award given for his breads and he wrote an entire foreward on using instant yeast and why you should and I was discussing this ... she recommended this particular brand for both it 's results , value , and taste from her own bread.I am an apt person to be able to compare because I 've been using Fleishman 's for a good while now and maybe it 's my imagination , but I swear the LaSaffre gives me far better results . Because of freshness ? Maybe . But it does.I have also found it at restaurant supply stores and I look at that as a good thing if bakeries buy it in bulk ... Negatives : None as far as quality . Just know this is quite a large bag and you do n't want air to break down your yeast so you either need to go through it quickly or store it in the freezer to maintain freshness if you are n't whipping out bread as fast as I am . : - ) Conclusion : Seems to work better , last longer , and is bagged for freshness while being cheaper . Worth it .	1
First use I put the remaining yeast into 2 jars and put into the refrigerator.Using almost weekly for bread baking and its working great , much more economical and less aggravating than those little packets of yeast .	1
why buy packets ? ? when you can save a truckload of money buying bulk ! when i found this , saf instant yeast , i was amazed . baking has become much cheaper for me.i actually got a pound from a friend who ordered from another spot.brick comes sealed , when cracked you hear the release of air.i put a nice portion in an airtight container , and slapped it in my fridge . that 's the one i 'll mainly use.the rest i have in an airtight container which resides in my freezer for when the main stash in the fridge runs out.one pound of this saf yeast , is almost equal in price of 3 packets of another brand yeast in my local supermarket.WHAT A GREAT DEAL ! if you bake and buy packet yeast , you need to get yourself one of these , saf yeast pounder = ) great quality , great price ! happy baking = ) !	1
I discovered this brand of yeast a few years back when troubleshooting issues with my first bread machine ; I found that not only did it solve the problems of less than perfect results from the machine but it improved the results with my hand kneaded loaves as well . I bake in smaller quantities for a single person and only a few times a week so this size was more than I could use but still more economical than the smaller packages . I store it in the coldest part of my refrigerator in an airtight container . At the two year mark it was still `` active '' and producing good loaves , but I 'd rather not discover the hard way when it is truly past its peak so I 've purchased it again . Excellent results every time !	1
I used it for the first time this morning . Great rise . Great texture . I 've been unhappy with grocery store yeast but NOW I KNOW I can bake . I 've got it stuck in the freezer and looking at what to bake next .	1
I bake all of my own homemade bread ( ca n't stand the store stuff ) and this yeast has a shelf life of 2 years in an airtight container in the fridge . I highly recommend it !	1
As soon as I open saf , I put it in a container and pop it in the fridge . 1 year later and I 'm still getting beautiful loaves of bread.My local supermarket quit carrying saf ( probably because I only buy it once per year ! ) so Amazon saved the day .	1
This is just to let you know there is another listing on Amazon for a 4 pack of these 1-pounders for only a few bucks more ! Much better value if you can put it to good use ! Update : Just received my 4-pack , and baked some bread . I am very happy with the results . Good yeast ! I put it in a ziplock bag , and am refrigerating it so I can get more use out of it . The bags are vacuum-packed , so they should stay fresh until they are opened ( though the package has a `` best if used by '' for 2 years after the manufacture date ) . I ordered this in March , and it was manufactured/produced in November , so it is pretty fresh .	1
I have always used Saf so this is a prejudiced review . I keep it in an airtight , moisture proof container in the refrigerator . It has been in my fridge for over a year at times and less than 6 months for most of the time . There are currently only 2 people in this household , unlike the 8 before , when I 'd use it up much faster.I love baking all kinds of breads with this . Challah once a week , sandwich bread , rolls , french bread , etc ... I should say that I grind my own wheat and it is a great yeast for that heavier flour .	1
This is just the best yeast ! I always get a perfect rise out of it and my kids love the taste it adds to breads , etc . I keep a pouch in my fridge and store one in my freezer for all my bread and baking needs .	1
You can keep this in the freezer , so it stays fresh a long time , and is much cheaper than the little packets from the grocery.I use it without thawing . I do n't know if that would work with traditional bread recipes , might need a slightly longer first rise.But I use a recipe for `` no knead '' bread that requires a 20-24 hour rise after the initial mixing of dough and before baking . I mix my dough after dinner one night and cook it for dinner the second night . With that long a rise , I ca n't tell the difference between starting with frozen yeast versus fresh yeast.So this is very handy for me since I just measure out the frozen yeast and at a significant savings over individual packets from the grocery .	1
One of my old college roommates introduced me to instant yeast and I will never go back to the stuff in the packets . This is great for all my bread-baking needs ! Make sure to keep any unused portion in the fridge or freezer .	1
I use instant yeast to make home made DIY CO2 for several of my planted aquariums . In the past the mixture I made usually lasted about a week.It is now 19 days into the first batch of DIY CO2 that I made with SAF instant yeast , and the CO2 bubbles are still going strong.If the CO2 bubbles last another two days at this rate the CO2 production using SAF will have lasted three times longer than the last instant yeast that I used.This yeast is amazing . If it 's nearly as good at making bread as it is for making DIY CO2 I will be even more pleased.Highly recommended !	1
If you hate proofing your yeast , this is for you ! You can skip that nasty little step and get on with your baking ! You might want to invest in a & # 34 ; yeast measuring spoon & # 34 ; to just reach in and get the exact amount of a dry package if you do n't like precision measurements ( since I believe a package is about 2 1/4 tsps ) .	1
This yeast is slightly stronger than the average rapid yeast . If your recipie calls for MORE than 1 1/2 tsp of yeast , you can subtract 1/4 tsp to get similar results compared to most rapid yeasts . I split up the package into one large sealed BPA free Rubbermaid 4 up container ... and one 4 ounce everyday container for daily use . The big one goes in the freezer and the little one goes into the reefer . You save a lot over getting the small packets !	1
It 's yeast so I do n't know what else to say . It works well and got here quick . I will be ordering more .	1
used this when I got it to make homemade bread in bread machine on dough cycle ... dough rose wonderfully compared to the active dry yeast I had been using ( which is still within expiration timeframe ) ... went online and found out I can freeze this ... so I keep it in an airtight lock and lock container ... still works very well direct from freezer ... it arrives in vacuum packed foil type pouch	1
Have you ever wanted to know how professional bakers could afford to bake bread and rolls and give them away with the price of yeast as high as it is ? Here 's the secret : SAF-Instant Yeast ! A 16-ounce will last for all the home baking most people will do for months , or perhaps years . It is supposed to last one year , but it can easily last 5-10 years , according to a number of sources . It is to be stored in a cool dry place.SAF Instant Yeast is a powerful and fast-acting yeast . It can be added to dry ingredients directly . It is twice as active as regular compressed yeast .	1
I realize I could have purchased it elsewhere for less price , but since it is n't available locally , and the shipping was free here as an & # 34 ; add-on & # 34 ; I went with Amazon . I can tell the difference in my breads using this brand over the Fleishmans . It gives a constant even rise . the best thing I like about this yeast is that I can use it straight from the freezer with same great results , which eliminates the waiting for & # 34 ; room temperature & # 34 ; state required by other yeasts I 've used .	1
You ca n't beat the price . Even if you 're used to buying the small 4 oz . jars of Fleischmann 's for less than $ 5 , this is a whole Lb . for just $ 7.25 ! It does require proofing , so it 's not a substitute for recipes that require & # 34 ; Rapid Rise & # 34 ; yeast , but it 's fresh ( I got a batch produced in 04/13 in 08/13 ) and it 's got a two year shelf-life . I 've used quite a bit of it so far and I have n't noticed any delay in rising time , or any difference in flavor from what I was using before . It 's worth trying for sure .	1
I do n't know about you , but I have found most types of dried yeast to be temperamental . Sometimes , it just wo n't work ( even though it has n't expired and it 's been stored properly and all that ) . This yeast , however , is as dependable as an old workhorse . Never needs proofing , just works !	1
I always tend to read the most negative reviews first , and work my way up to 5 stars ( unless there are way too many reviews to read ) . In the past I have purchased bulk yeast . However this is the first time I have purchased instant yeast and the particles are much smaller . Because of the persons who said in their reviews that the yeast was dead-on-arrival , I proofed some of mine when it arrived . See [ ... ] for a freshness test.________________________________________________________________________________________________________________These are some answers I received via email in response to some of my questions : '' The SAF Instant yeast is the industrial version of the RED STAR ( [ ... ] ) Quick Rise yeast that is sold in the grocery stores . Each packet of Quick Rise contains 2 1/4 teaspoons . For traditional baking , using the SAF Instant in place of the regular Active Dry Yeast , you would use the same amount/measure that your recipe calls for . Just keep in mind that the SAF Instant is a fast-acting yeast , so you will want to keep an eye on your dough as it may rise faster . `` `` If you are using the yeast in a bread machine full cycle , use 1/2 teaspoon of yeast for each cup of flour in the recipe . This rule applies to both the SAF Instant and the Quick Rise yeast . `` `` For longer than 2 -3 months , the yeast must be stored airtight and in the freezer . In the refrigerator , it should be airtight and should last no more than 3 months . '' ( NOTE : when I asked how long it would last in the freezer I received a `` conditional '' answer . I was told that it depended on how old it already was when the package was first opened , whether it was a deep freeze or a self-defrosting freezer , and on the air-tightness of the storage container . She said to stored it in zippered plastic bags with as much air expressed out as the bag is being sealed . However , I always do that and then store the plastic bag of yeast in a tightly closed glass jar . I have had frozen yeast last for 3 years + . ) ________________________________________________________________________________________________________________Some reviewers said there was no dating information on the package . The area on the back of the bag for dating information looks as though the information should be added in the space below where the production date , the expiration date , and the batch number headings are listed . However , it is not there , but printed on the heat sealed seam to the right of those headings , in small type that is not obvious . I received mine on 11/19/03 . It was produced 4/03 , expires 4/05 , and there is also a production batch number ( I do suggest saving the bag ) . The package says to refrigerate after opening . The bag is not a ` resealable ' bag , so I filled a small glass jar and put it in the refrigerator.My husband has a family history of Diabetes , and he has been watching his starches for awhile , so I quit baking as I used to . However , now that he is taking medication for his blood sugar problem he is again eating more starches so at a minimum I will make pizza . I did use some of this yeast with Gold Medal Bread Flour ( much cheaper than King Arthur when you are just doing basic yeast baked goods ) to make Pizza on 11/21/2003 and the yeast worked very fast and very well .	1
I have usedRed StarandFleischmann 's Yeastand both good , but I 've come to really prefer the LeSaffre yeast.I 'discovered ' LeSaffre yeast while reading through bread recipes at the King Arthur website and the positive reviews there motivated me to get out of my rut and try something new.Since I had begun to bake all of my family 's bread , I was okay with ordering a pound of yeast . Given the price of the little packets , and even the little jars , it made sense to make the purchase because even if I ended up throwing some away , it would still be much cheaper to buy the yeast this way.The reason I like the LeSaffre yeast is that it gives me a better and more consistent rise -- and I use whole wheat flour.Definitely recommend .	1
I did research and read that SAF is about the best yeast in the world . Well ... I have found it works better with some recipes and not as well with others . ( Whole Wheat vs White , Home Milled Flour vs Store Bought ) . This is also a large amount of yeast . I am not sure if it is to be refrigerated or not ... but I have chosen to vacuum seal it in a Mason Jar and store in fridge to try and keep it fresh for as long as possible . In the future , I will stick with the other smaller jars I can get at the grocery store .	1
If you love using your bread machine and want a reliable yeast that does not need to be proofed ( ca n't remember the last time I did that ) , then this yeast will make your life much easier . While this is not a rapid yeast , the bread does seem to rise more quickly than with packets of yeast from the grocery store . This saves time and gives you an empowered feeling instead of the `` Is this going to rise or not ? '' feeling.The yeast can be stored in the refrigerator or freezer and is very convenient to use . Unlike the yeast cakes , you do n't have to worry about mixing it with water or milk . You just measure it into the bread machine.Here is the recipe I love making for Focaccia bread . It turns out wonderful and you can start it in the bread machine or make it by hand . We serve this in slices or squares topped with butter and fresh rosemary or an herbed cream cheese . Perfect with homemade soup in the winter.Focaccia for the Bread Machine ( start in machine , finish by hand ) 2 1/2 cups water2 tablespoons Saf instant yeast2 tablespoons sugar2 teaspoons freshly crushed sea salt2 tablespoons olive oil6 cups all-purpose flour ( the Baker 's Catalogue sells an amazing flour ) Measure the water , yeast , sugar , salt , olive oil and flour into the bread pan . Program for white bread , dough cycle and large loaf . After the dough has been kneaded , you can put it in a large stainless bowl and cover the dough with a damp cloth . I normally forget it is in there and catch it just before it is about to rise over the top of the pan , so it still works , either way . You could also use half the ingredients for just one loaf if you want to let it rise in the bread machinepan.Let it rise until double in a warm place . My secret it to turn the oven on and then almost immediately off ( just leave it on until you feel some heat on your hand ) and this seems to create a `` just warm enough '' environment for bread to rise . Punch down and divide into thirds . Roll out two squares and one elongated loaf . This works well on the regular size cookie sheets . If you have a larger cookie sheet , you can roll the dough into two 8-inch squares.Make deep indents with the end of the rolling pin handle at regular intervals . Then brush with olive oil . Let the bread rise until almost doubled.Either sprinkle with sea salt or sprinkle with dried or fresh rosemary and sea salt . You can also top the dough with tomato slices , onion slices and sliced and pitted Kalamata olives before baking.Bake at 400 degrees for 30 minutes.After the bread cools , it will slice easily and it freezes very well . I normally slice two loaves and cut one into squares for sandwiches.To make an Herbed Cream Cheese : Blend together 1/3 cup butter , 1 ( 8-ounce ) package cream cheese , 2 teaspoons dried parsley , 2 teaspoons dried rosemary and 1 teaspoon dried thyme.The idea for this bread came to me after visiting a sandwich shop at a garden center in Seattle . After arriving home from visiting my grandmother , I knew I had to try to make the cream cheese and the bread because they were perfect to serve with homemade soup.This bread has a lot of possibilities so you can vary the toppings to suit the types of soups you are serving.The Instant yeast always works and with a bread machine , you end up feeling like a professional baker . The results are sure to impress . The bread always has a `` fresh from the bakery '' taste unlike the taste of breads made with packets of yeast.~The Rebecca Review	1
I have used instant yeast for bread baking for years . I see no difference in results from active dry yeast and I like not having to dissolve and proof it . This is a huge quantity and a bargain at $ 10 . I keep it in the freezer and expect it to last for years.The only negative is the packaging.The vac pack is about impossible to open . I had to cut it and transfer to another container . But that 's minor .	1
I discovered this yeast nearly 20 years ago and have used it ever since . Of all the yeasts tested at King Arthur Flour test kitchens , this is the one THEY recommend and that 's good enough for me.This yeast will keep well beyond the expiration date if sealed in a freezer bag and placed in the freezer . I keep a small jar of it in my fridge for daily baking and the rest in my freezer with the purchase date marked on the front , then simply refill my jar as needed.I 've never once had a failure with this yeast . To use , simply omit the `` proofing '' stage . Most recipes use measured yeast but older recipes call for packages . Two teaspoons of SAF Instant is equivalent to one package.Many assume Instant Yeast and Rapid Rise yeast are the same . . .however , they are not . Instant Yeast merely omits the proofing stage and is recipe ready as is . Rapid rise causes the dough to rise more rapidly , but what 's gained in time is lost in flavor as the fermenting stage is decreased .	1
One pound of yeast is a heck of a lot of yeast for the casual baker . I only make bread about once or twice a month so I barely made a dent in my supply after a year . And then ... five years later . I still have about a quarter cup , and it 's still good ! I admit i didnt used it as consistantly as & # 34 ; once or twice a month. & # 34 ; I lost interest in baking for a year since i was busy in college and also used sourdough exclusively for a period but for the majority of the 5 years , i used this yeast to make 60+ batches of dough . All I did was pour the stuff out in two small jars and keep them in the sitting in the freezer door . Always had great rise and even after the 5 years , no noticeable loss of power.I remember back when i first taught myself to bake ( about a year before buying this ) . The store only carried small packets of active dry yeast and they cost like five bucks for barely anything at all . To make matters worse , half of the time the yeast would n't even proof in the sugar-water solution . Maybe i was doing it wrong ... but i do n't care , it 's too tedious to wait for it to proof . Bread baking has enough waiting periods as it . In my opinion , the one step process and idiot-proof qualities of instant yeast far outweighs the slightly lower price of ( bulk ) active dry.I 've been baking a lot more recently so now i 'm finally getting a refill . Hurray Saf Instant Yeast !	1
In the past , I 've always just used Fleischmann 's active dry . That works really well , no question about it.Here 's why this I 'd say this is better:1 ) Cost - WAY cheaper than anything you can buy in the store . You have to use a decent amount of yeast to use this much ( It 's a LOT ) , but if you do , it 's a very good deal . This is probably 1/5 the cost anything you can buy in the stores.2 ) In my opinion , the flavor is slightly better than other yeast brands . I ca n't say it was vastly better , but subtly better.It will probably take me a few years to use this much yeast . To save it - I 've used a Ball jar . Do n't open the vacuum packed package until you need it , but when you do , empty the remaining yeast into your ball jar . Close it tight . Freeze it . Yeast will keep for several years in the freezer ( worked just fine in the past ) .	1
This yeast is perfect for no kneed artisan bread ( see picture of artisan bread made in 5 qt lodge cast iron pot ) . After opening I placed in zip lock bag in the refrigerator .	1
I been purchasing the small envelope yeast packages for a while now , and it 's getting really expensive ( around 3 dollars for three envelopes ) . Including shipping and handling , this makes it worth the purchase , as it would of cost me around 64 dollars to buy the same amount vs the 12 dollars to buy a pound . The yeast itself was great and worked wonderfully . : ) I am very happy with the product . A pound may sound a lot , but if you 're an active baker , it should n't be a problem . : ) Edit : The original review was on August 6 , 2009 and today is November 25 , 2011 . I have been using the SAF yeast ever since I purchased it with 1/3 of the bag left . I have been keeping the bag in the freeze since i had open it up without any problems . The freezer trick is to keep it from reacting from the moisture in the air and extend the useful life . The yeast had expired on April 2011 , yet it 's still going strong . The yeast are not as active ( slightly noticeable if you pay attention , but that is only during the fall/winter as expected ) as it was when the package was freshly open , but still better than the grocery store ones ) . I used it for hand knead dough and bread machine recipes , and they worked well with both.Edit # 2 : After my second edit on November 25 , 2011 , today is July 31 , 2013 . I had slow down on my yeast usage in the past year or so to only bi-weekly usage , but the yeast is still working wonderfully . I have noticed that the yeast became less active as I take it in and out of the freezer for usage ( moisture and what not ) . I separated the remanding 1/5 of yeast into small individual lock and lock containers to prevent moisture seeping into the yeast . Bottom line : It still works better than the store envelopes !	1
As someone that bakes a LOT , for my own family and others , Saf has been a dependable yeast.If you use yeast , it is absolutely throwing money out of the window to buy the small packets.I 've used yeast that has been frozen for over 3 years , and it is still active.I portion it into glass jars and always have a few in the freezer and one in the fridge.It lasts far beyond the expiration date when frozen.For each packet of yeast called for in a recipe , use 2 1/4 teaspoons .	1
I have been using this yeast for over 20 years . It is much better than standard yeast and is very reliable . I store mine in the freezer to keep it in top condition .	1
Do n't know why , and it has n't kept me from baking bread , but yeast has never been my friend . Thought the problem was the & # 34 ; mainstream brands , & # 34 ; but I bought a case of Bob 's Red Mill and did n't get ONE RISE out of it ( their customer service department never responded to my questions and complaint , either ; I poured every package into the compost ) .Today is the first day it wo n't be too hot to bake , so I opened the saf and started some bread . At first I thought I had another dud on my hands because after twenty minutes there were NO bubbles . But I could hear it crackling ! So I added the flour , kneaded the dough for a few minutes , and put it in the oven to rise.OMG THIS YEAST IS FANTABULOUS ! ! ! Checked on the first rise a few minutes ago and my jaw dropped . I have NEVER had bread rise this high before . This loaf is flour , alone ; ca n't wait to see what happens when I add flax , herbs , etc. , but would expect equally excellent results . SO happy to have saf in my arsenal and cupboard now , especially since Santa is bringing me a turbo convection oven which will allow me to bake bread all year long ( standard ovens and the tropics are not a good year-'round pairing ) . No question but that I 'll be buying more ( and in larger quantities since it can be kept well in the freezer for years ) .	1
i ca n't find this yeast in the market so i 'm grateful i can buy it on amazon . in my opinion it is so much better than other brands of yeast . i love baking bread with it . i keep it in the freezer and measure out what i need for the recipe . it never fails to give a delicious loaf of bread . the dough raises beautifully and has a wonderful crumb .	1
It 's yeast . Not sure what else one can say . I do keep it in the fridge in an airtight container , and take out what I need and let it come to room temp . Works great .	1
This product is a very fine grind , that works well in various breads to provide more and better texture , esp . for gluten-free ones . Having used this brand before for other items , I felt safe in ordering this and am pleased with it . I definitely will order more in the future .	1
Solid because it makes my poop come out really nice ! Do yourself a favor and buy this stuff . Clean your colon out regularly . Colon cancer is the easiest cancers to avoid .	1
We are very satisfied with this product . It just has psyllium husks - no additives , no sugar , no sugar substitutes , like all store and drugstore brands . It works great , it cleanses your intestines , gives you more energy . I know it also controls cholesterol , treats constipation and diarrhea and can lower your weight . However , my reason for taking it while being on anti-candida diet together with Candida clear , garlic , pau d'arco tea and grapefruit seed extract.Thank you for making this product with no additives ( ca n't take any added sugar )	1
Not tasty but very effective . I used it together in my protein morning drink every morning . I mixed it with 8 oz of water , an fresh egg yolk , 1/3 of lo carb protein vanilla powder , 2 tablespoon of cream and 1 sweet and low . Because I am on a lo carb diet and need the psyllium to regulate my system . Protein leaves almost no residue . I was tired of the expensive Metamucil . Problem solved .	1
This is an updated review for the third shipment as I purchase more than 10boxes for each order . I enjoy Stevita Supreme very much but there seems to be some inconsistency in the sweetness . The first box which I 've opened are n't sweetness ( and I 'm already using the 12th sachet in this particular box ) while the previous 2 shipments were all right . Can Stevita Stevia please explain on the inconsistency of sweetness and currently , I 've to use 1.5 sachet to get the sweetness while I use only one sachet for the 1st 2 shipments ? I still have 12 more boxes and I 'm wonderfing if I should continue using Stevia .	1
Update 8//10/13 - just happen to mention this ( noxious cloud from emptying the packets ) to the doctor when we were in for a checkup this spring . She suggested Trader Joe 's Organic Stevia Extract ( powder , granules ? ) . Sure enough , no cloud . Super small measuring device included ; some people might not like dealing with it . We like it.We make ice tea in the Mr. Coffee ice tea maker ( old style ) four or five times a week and it only takes four packets to suite my wife 's taste for 64 ounces . I was thrown off by the 1.8 ounce packet , but apparently they have added a heavy carrying agent that does n't make the stuff so noxious when you empty it into the pitcher . Good deal !	1
I have long searched for a replacement for salt , trying various spices in the grocery store . None of them could cure my need for salty flavored foods.Well then , I went to try and design a sugar free pasta sauce and I used stevia . The surprise was that now I could leave out the salt too , and not even miss it . Once an awhile I add salt just to be safe because we all need at little in our diet . But if I forget whether I tossed in some salt or not , I ca n't tell by tasting.Nobody wants sugar on their scrambled eggs . And garden tomatoes needs salt , never sugar . But if a dish normally has both a lot of sugar and a little salt , try stevia to replace both ! Like these oat bran muffins : [ Credit goes to _Caique_ on the American Heart Association forum who created a first version ] .Healthy Oatbran Muffins.Yields 6 regular sized muffins.1 and 1/4 cups oatbran flour , for example : Bob 's Red Mill Oatbran Cereal ( this is not oatmeal ) .1/2 cup all purpose white flour.1 packet stevia powder.1 tablespoon baking powder.1/3 cup dry powdered milk.7 oz water3 tablespoons liquid egg whites ( e.g . All Whites brand ) 1 tablespoon canola or olive oil ( these are your two healthy oils ) -- Crisco No-Stick spray ( their oil is 100 % canola ) .Stir dry ingredients 10 seconds.Add liquids and stir a minute.Spray a second or so inside each cup of the muffin tin with Crisco No-Stick.Bake at 450 degrees for 30 minutes.A toaster oven is handy for the job and some will just fit a 12 inch wide six muffin tin.One which has served well for years and barely fits a 12 inch x 12 inch square pan is : Proctor Silex 31120.Proctor-Silex 31120 Pizza Oven -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -This is a very basic recipe with a prep time under 10 minutes.Has no sugar , salt , or yolks for health reasons.Medical associations say a cup a day of oat bran reduces LDL cholesterol , and regulates insulin.All Whites and powdered milk were used because they store a long time until opened . But they are not necessarily healthier.You could replace All Whites with 1 large egg white.You could replace water and milk powder with 1 cup skim milkYou could replace stevia with 2 teaspoons sugar + dash of salt.Stevia packets are sized to add to one cup of coffee.9 packets of stevia = 18 teaspoons sugar = 1 teaspoon of liquid stevia dropsMy local supermarkets stock all ingredients : Even the Red Mill Oatbran , stevia , and chilled cartons of All Whites .	1
This is an alternative to sugar and artificial sweeteners , however , it is an acquired taste . I can not stress this enough . It has its distinctive taste , and you may or may not adjust to it . Over time , I have adjusted to the taste . But in terms of pure taste , I still prefer sugar - by a long shot ! However , sugar has lots of sugary calories , so , hello Stevia ! I mostly use this to sweeten coffee.I have also tried this brand ( Sun Crystals All-Natural Sweetener , Amazon product code B0028GWGF6 ) , and from what I recall , the taste is more or less similar . This one may be slightly more subdued.The Stevita box you see in the picture is very thin , the flap at the top got torn sideways while trying to open it . No big deal , but treat it gingerly when opening for the first time . Inside the box you find 50 individual packets.I can not stress this enough , this is an acquired taste type of a product ! Do n't expect to try it once or twice and fall in love with it .	1
This is a great tasting brand of Stevia . Price is excellent too.Try it very good in tea and decaf coffee .	1
I like the flavor of this stevia , and the individual packs are very convenient . You ca n't beat this price !	1
Not sure if it is or is n't more healthy than Splenda . It 's more expensive , even at this price . But I buy it in hopes it 's better for me than Splenda . Maybe it is , maybe it is n't . It 's not as sweet as Splenda , but I still like it .	1
I tried this in coffee and tea ( hot ) , and did n't care for the taste , but for sweetening fruit smoothies or chia puddings , I ca n't do without it !	1
I have been eating Atkins life style for a yr now and was using splenda and pink packet sweetners until I realized I was forgetting almost everything of normal routine stuff , and having extreme headaches daily , I thought I was going insane . I decided to try stevita after reading some reveiws about stevia , I gradually started putting in half stevita and half pink packet , I do n't ever recommend doing that , I ended up with a horrible reaction , the headaches went from pain to a numb tingly feeling to flu like symtoms then my urine became a floresent yellow that smelled 10ft away like a chemical , never try that again . I have been using stevita now for 7mnths and love it , I put a packet in a cup of warm coconut milk with malt , thats my cheat treat from eating Atkins once a wk , lovely stuff and low carb .	1
I think a lot of people look at sweetener and they have to compare it to sugar . If you like sugar , then you need to use sugar . Plain and simple . But if you 're `` willing '' to try other items to sweeten things , then certainly I think Stevia Supreme is worth a try.I found out about this product fist by doing a Google search on Truvia , and read a great article about that . . . and that 's where I found out about Stevia , and why it 's a `` dietary supplement '' .So . . . I came to Amazon.com and found Stevia Supreme . I read the reviews and decided to try it . . . and I 'm glad I did ! When I first put some on my finger and tasted it . . . YUCK ! I thought . . . this is NOT sugar ! But then I decided to try it in some lemon/lime-ade and I really like it ! I think it 's quite a bit `` sweeter '' than sugar . But make no mistake . . it 's NOT sugar . I make quick lemonade or limeade ( or lemon/lime-ade ) with True Lemon / True LimeTrue Lemon Crystallized Fruit Wedge ~ 192 Ct BulkTrue Lime Crystallized Fruit Wedge ~ 192 Ct BulkThis makes a refreshing , sweet beverage . I certainly do n't think that Stevia Supreme is going to work for everyone . . . but . . . at this price , you can try it and see if it 's right for you . As more and more reports are coming out about other sweeteners not really being very good for you . . . and Stevia has been used for many . . .many years . .. I think I 'll stick with Stevia Supreme . . .at least for now . : - )	1
Ive tried them allllllllll and the verdict is still out but so far I would rate this the best . What I mean by best is that its not sugar but its as close as Ive managed to get in coffee . I dont have a problem using anything while baking but in my coffee ... .urgh . Nothing beats the taste of sugar . This comes close and Ive bought the Stevia drops in chocolate , toffee and vanilla . I guess Toffee was the best of the worst but my kids love it in Milk so its a treat for them ! As I run around the house chasing 3 kids , my coffee gets cold and that is the ultimate test , is it drinkable after its cold . Im drinking it now and I can do this ! Weight loss here I come ! I can honestly say , I will order this again and I can drink it and almost really enjoy it .	1
No off taste , works well , after years of sugar in my tea I am converted and great price ! ! ! ! !	1
This is the best stevia blend I 've found so far . It 's especially great for iced tea - it dissolves fairly quickly , not to mention the flavor is good . I use , at most , half a pack for iced tea . For coffee , I use most of the packet.I carry these everywhere I go .	1
I tried the Sweet Leaf stevia a few years ago and found it had an aftertaste that turned me off to stevia as a regular sugar substitute in my diet.I am GLAD I paid attention to the other folks who bought this brand of Stevia ! ! It 's wonderful ! Has absolutely NO aftertaste even straight out of the packet on your finger ! Now I will use stevia since I can handle a good tasting stevia any day ! ! Highly recommend this product if you do n't like an aftertaste in your stevia .	1
I really like this sweetener for it 's taste and less than two bucks a box . For me , many of the artificial sweeteners have an after taste and trigger a headache which makes them unusable . I have n't had those problems with Stevia OR Stevita . However I have noticed using half a Stevita packet sweetens enough without the grassy flavor I detect when I use an entire packet . This is definitely a WIN !	1
After trying NuNaturals NuStevia , this one tastes almost like real sugar ! It is actually the closest to the real thing among the ones I 've tried . I will buy this brand again but of course will try other brands to see if I like it better than this . If I have to rate the sugar taste similarity ( 10 being exactly the same as sugar ) , I would say : NuNaturals - 5Stevita Supreme - 7.5Also , the other thing I like about this brand , it is not like powder powder . It is kinda crystallized like sugar .	1
Item arrived in timely manner . Great for spinkling on cereal , and sweetening tea . Of course if you 're using it for making jelly it is just like using most other sugar alternatives the texture will be different . I will definately buy stevia again !	1
Yes , I like this in my hot tea.No , I do not like it in my coffee .	1
This is a mix of Stevia , Xylitol , and something called Rebaudiana extract . I have n't tried other Stevia products but this does have a slightly bitter aftertaste when taken straight . Also , it does clump in the packet . On the plus side I have n't had the , er , alimentary issues I 've had with straight Xylitol.I 'm glad I tried this , but I 'm not planning to keep using it . I do n't think it 's significantly different from using honey as a sweetener - but that 's not what I want for coffee !	1
I 'm trying a few other brands of Stevia , but I will stick with these when I reorder . I like my stuff sweet and this is the stuff ! ! ! I used to drink coffee/tea with a lot of sugar in it , but I wanted to get away from that . I do n't like those yellow , blue & pink packs of sweetner , but I was using them anyway until I could n't stand it any longer . Real sugar would try and sneak it 's way back in . I think I was hooked on sugar ? ? ! ! I was glad to find this product . It 's great and sugar does n't call my name anymore . Try it , you 'll like it ! ! ! ! Stop eating all that sugar ! ! ! ! ! !	1
The flavor and convenience of the packets make this one a keeper and a basic to stock in the cupboard .	1
this had a bit more powder included in each package , so more sweet . the 50 packets is nice amount	1
I bought this for around 2.50 shipped with amazon prime . This was a great price to buy 50 packets of stevita supreme . I use one packet in my tea and 2 in my coffee . it 's perfect for use in sweetening iced tea or coffee , hot or cold i 've not noticed any fake aftertaste . Does n't give me a headache like sweet and low or equal will . Stevia has 0 calories and comes from a natural plant . stevita is the best brand I 've tried . I will order this again .	1
I have been buying this product for almost 2 years . It 's the best price I 've ever found for packets of stevia . Use this every morning in my coffee ... no bitter aftertaste and dissolves easily . I always have it on hand for when I travel or hit up Starbucks as well !	1
I bought this for price and the fact I use Stevia . I actually like this although my husband found this to be a little sweet so he uses only a half of a package . I will definately buy this again !	1
I only speak for myself when I say I really like the taste . I think it has to do with your tastebuds more than the product itself . I use it in my coffee everyday and I will keep buying this as long as I can .	1
I 've tried several brands of stevia and they all taste a little different . I think this is the best tasting stevia . It has a clean sweet taste . And I only need a little bit , one packet will last 3-4 drinks for me . If you 've shopped much for stevia , you know the price on this one is great , too .	1
I find this product to be very pleasantly sweet without any aftertaste . I will use less than with similar stevia packet products ( just one instead of two packets . ) Sure with this was a subscribe and save .	1
I am on a raw food diet and no sugar to make my body alkaline , and this product is an alkaline product . so if you are off sugar this is a great product .	1
This is the stuff that makes your chop suey taste like chinese take out . It was missing in my order I think it may have been broken during shipping . It is good enough to steal though lol . I 've sent a note to company through Amazon and I am sure they will solve the problem . If you can get it locally it is much less expensive . There are lots of great cooks here and I 've tried lots of stuff I 've never had before . Sometimes you just get a taste for & # 34 ; northern chinese & # 34 ; lol . I 've used this brand for many years with complete satisfaction . Use very very sparingly . I usually start out with about 1/2 -3/4 teaspoon . Stir well add more if needed . A little goes a long way .	1
I use this in pad kee mao and it is also one of the main ingredients I use in my stir fry dishes . Just heat a little oil in a pan , cook some thinly sliced meat , add oyster sauce and veggies and cook till meat is done and veggies are tender . Serve over rice . So easy .	1
I usually by my oriental spices at a store out of State but with no immediate plans to travel that way I decided to try ordering form Amazon . Same stuff I always get , just could n't read it on the bottle in the picture . great taste and a must for many oriental dishes	1
I have used this oyster sauce in several Asian dishes and it does enhance the flavor of the dishes and I would use it again .	1
Taste . Goes well with Asian foods but can be used for just about anything . This product has good taste and quality .	1
I usually buy tons of stuff here on Amazon , but when I started looking for Hoisin I just trodded through the grocery stores . All they had was some no name brand in a jar . I dont know about you but when I am eating chinese or vietnamese food I am for the most part using chop sticks and just want to hose something on it and pop it in my mouth . The only kind I ever saw in restaurants was this kind with the squirty bottle and got used to it . The jar just looked stupid , then you would need a spoon , then a bowl , then cleanup ahhhh.Had a brain flash and said & # 34 ; look on Amazon and there it was . Same brand as the good food places I frequent.Life is now complete .	1
I use this stuff like it was ketchup , honestly . It goes with everything . Hoisin is awesome on chinese food , thai food , vietnamese food , its good with hamburgers , fries , and even with steak instead of steak sauce . Hoisin is sweet , and salty and has this certain kick to it that makes it unique amoung condiments . The first time i ever saw it used was when i was watching PBS Yan Can Cook , and he busted out the Lee Kum Kee bottle and i was mesmerized with its rich brown color , and Yan Can do no wrong with me ! ! ! !	1
Hoisin sauce is yummy . I mix it with several other ingredients to make peanut sauce , or we eat it plain with rice or rice noodles . I have tried other brands , but I really like this one . The flavor is just right and it 's sweet enough , but not too sweet.It is a little thicker than some others , similar to the thickness of oyster sauce .	1
I think I need to try other hoisin brands , the taste is good but I do n't have enough experience to tell if I like this one as much as I might like another . It 's like ketchups , I love Heinz but hate the rest . I will update once I try some other hoisin as to which is my favorite kind .	1
This is my first time using this ingredient in my fried rice ; I find that it perks up the taste .	1
this is something you need for chinese cooking and you 'll start finding other uses for it as you get more adventuring in your cooking	1
my family must have gluten-free products and I am so glad that I was able to get this sauce . It is very good ! I use it often in my cooking Asian foods .	1
I needed Hoisin sauce for some of my recipes and never remember to buy it , so I ordered this . It is very tasty and definitely adds to the dishes I cook . Definitely will order this again .	1
I have used this in several Asian dishes and it is just the right spiciness and will last for quite sometime . I would recorder this Hoisin sauce again .	1
I learned how to roll summer rolls . Hoisin sauce is great for the filling . If you like Asian foods , this is a necessary .	1
I 'm fortunate to have a local store that sells great pickled ginger made fresh , but getting minced ginger is a chore . I went through several different brands and types before I found this one . A bit sweet , a bit spicy and easy to mix into most anything , I like this ginger because it 's a simple addition to Asian dishes . No mincing to do on your own , the ginger itself is moist with a nice consistency and everything about it seemed fresh . I 'm about to buy another jar of it .	1
I 've been trying different pre-prepared grated ginger products lately . This is good enough for me ; MUCH easier than trying to keep fresh ginger around ( mine always goes bad since I rarely finish it up ) . If a recipe needs ginger , this is a great substitute to have in the fridge .	1
It 's very hard to get good , fresh ginger where I live , and this minced ginger is a HUGE help to me . Unlike the jarred garlic that is also available , this minced ginger is almost ( at least to my taste ) indistinguishable from fresh ginger that I mince myself.Highly recommended !	1
Been using this in place of freshly minced ginger and it works great . It does n't have quite the same taste , but it 's so close that I do n't really notice it much .	1
Peeling and grating ginger is a labor intensive and time consuming process . This product eliminates all that extra time and work . I use it to put in the basket with my loose leaf teas to get a nice ginger tang to my tea and for any other recipe or sauce or salsa or anything else I make that needs a ginger tang . Even great for quick breads and cookies and does n't have the sugar of candied ginger which many recipes call for . You can replace the sugar with artificial sweeteners if you need the sweetness .	1
Even though I live in Montana and never want to leave , I do miss the ubiquity of good Chinese food restaurants in San Francisco . Because I pride myself on being able to cook my own versions of various foods I like , I knew I needed minced ginger for the sheer amount of Asian dishes that require it.I 've already used it in several recipes and the flavor is nice and strong . Just like when I buy containers of minced garlic ( something that is FAR easier to find in your average Montana grocery store ) , I tend to buy enough to last me for a decent amount of time . This 7.5oz jar will likely last me until sometime in the new year . By then I 'll have $ 25 in my cart so that this will ship with it ( The add-on program is perfect for stuff like this ) .	1
I feel I paid to much for this at Amazon but not always having somebody around to run the store to get fresh ginger for me or not wanting to inconvient somebody makes having this around a big help when I want good ginger flavor in my recipe , no this is not a perfect replacement for the real thing but works real well with great ginger flavor.Just make sure you look around before buying like I did since there is better prices out there but to be fair Amazon provides great service and two day delivery which most do not and if they do provide two day service it costs a small fortune .	1
Thankfully , we were able to find this candy at a great price on Amazon and missed the usually Halloween pranks this year . Thank you Amazon and Hoosier Hill Farm for offering affordable quality candy to the masses .	1
There are so much smarties here that it will likely last any smarty lover for quite some time . The quality of each smarty is consistent and tastes good .	1
Amazing candy , I love these things and boy do they make me feel smartie-er ! They can make even marginal folks feel smartie-er !	1
I was looking for something with lots of pieces and a reasonable price , since we have gaggles of kids coming around on Halloween . Well , these turned out to be perfect . We did n't run out and one of the moms even asked for some since they were her favorites ! Will be back next year for more !	1
What can you say about smarties except they are at one really bad for you but really taste good . Yum yum yum	1
This has a great taste . Improves every one of my asian recipes . Expensive compared to other choices but well worth it .	1
This is very very good Missy . First of all , you should not be using that Kikkomann crap youbought at the grocery . This is a professional grade soy sauce , naturally brewed with a verysmooth and savory texture that is flavorful and easy on the palate . A must for any Chinesetakeout , and particularly for homemade marinades . Dont even attempt to make Teriyaki marinadewithout a good quality dark soy sauce like this.Lee Kum Kee is a major producer of a variety of Chinese food products for the consumer and therestaurant trade . They have a fantastic website with recipes and instructional cooking videoscovering a range of well known dishes . 5 Stars ! ( link to website posted in Comments section )	1
This is the perfect soy for making stir fry ; pepper steak and for marinades . Dark soy is heavier than the stuff you get at the grocery store . If you have never used dark soy to cook , I would highly recommend it - has a fuller bodied flavor and makes a huge difference when making the brown sauce ( like in pepper steak or beef with asparagus , etc . ) If you are like me , once you have used dark soy for cooking , you will never again use the thin watery soy sauce .	1
this is much better than regular soy sauce for cooking . it gives your dish great color and flavor and you only have to use a little bit . it does n't make your dish as salty as when you use regular soy sauce .	1
I really like the depth of flavor with this sauce . I found that many recipes prefer this exact sauce to use .	1
I love to use this Soy Sauce for everything that I cook in my wok ! It is well worth the money . I love to use different Soy Sauces for different dishes and this soy sauce is one of my favorites . I also mix this sauce with other sauces , to get different tastes . I highly recommend .	1
This is a very well balanced dark soy sauce . This is important in Chinese cooking . Maybe you might consider this brand for your next Chinese meal .	1
This soy is very tasty and definitely my favorite . Tastes great in all my cooking and for dipping my homemade egg rolls in as well . I will purchase this again .	1
Lee Kum Kee Preimum Dark Soy adds that little extra punch of soy sauce flavor that is sometimes needed beyond using Tamari - my go to soy sauce . Like it and will continue to experiment using it .	1
I think it 's worth buying overall , since I do n't have any grocery store near me even though I live in off-campus apartment . Why not get it to make your food much more tasty ?	1
Good soy sauce that is of premium quality . I use it for my asian dishes and the outcome is just great .	1
I recently sent for a Senseo Coffee Pod maker on a very good deal , & was looking here to get the pods . I read a lot of the reviews , & was looking foward to getting them here , plus this brand sounds like it would be to my taste . However , they apparently do n't ship to Alaska ! At least it said they do n't ship to my location , & since I have gotten other items from Amazon , I assume it 's the Alaska location . How disappointing , after reading so many great reviews . Just had to vent a bit . I enjoyed the reviews , though , they really are a help , good & not-so-good .	1
All right , we today became beneficiaries of a free coffee maker from Senseo , thanks to a generous tip from a favorite of my Amazon friends.But this brand of coffee packets that came with the machine is nothing to write home about . At retail , the packs cost about 23 cents , if we order enough to avoid shipping charges.The smell of this fresh-brewed coffee is fantastic . The taste is less than I had hoped for . I think I 'll try Target 's Archer Farms , as suggested by another reviewer .	1
We got our first Senseo during their Drop the Drip online promotion in December . My husband loved the coffee , especially the Medium Roast . We ended up buying another Senseo for him to use at work . I do n't drink coffee , so this was the perfect solution . No more making a pot and tossing the rest . He can get a cup of joe or make two if he wants . The pods were a little pricey though ... at Walmart they average around $ 3.84 for 10 or .38 each . Buying bulk like this , it makes them .25 each at the current price of $ 17.96 . They come each in their own bag of 18 , so no worries about freshness . My Dad also got a Senseo via Drop the Drip and we just sent him some Medium Roast because he loves it too . It is a great gift for Senseo lovers . He lives in a small town and never thought to look to Amazon for his Senseo coffee needs ! I think when he runs out , he will be on Amazon looking to buy the multi-pack .	1
Love this coffee ... a nice , smooth , robust cup of coffee with no bitterness.And signing up for Amazon 's subscription/automatic shipping program is one of the smartest things I 've ever done . It 's not only convenient , but it saves me money and time ... I get 4 bags sent to my door for what 3 bags would cost in the supermarket , and I do n't have to go there and back for them either . Works for me !	1
This is good tasting coffee for your Senseo machine . It is not bitter and is very palatable to the taste . The coffee does not turn out watery but is also not very full bodied . Much cheaper price than buying single packs at the grocery store .	1
This product has good flavor for a decaf coffee . I was using S & S to keep stocked , but it was canceled . The only downside to the product is that I had to transfer the pods to a airtight container after opening the bag . The bag would n't open cleanly , and you could n't get it to close tightly .	1
The Senseo coffee is a great easy alternative to the regular american coffee , virtually no clean-up or maintenance . Do n't give it a 5 because it is far from a perfect espresso and a little pricey .	1
I have found this so much easier to use with my Hamilton Coffee maker . My coffee is perfect every time . Takes the guess work out of whether you have added enought coffee of not enough . Great sale also .	1
This is some great tastings coffee and I ca n't tell the difference between it and a good medium roast . Its a fine quality and tastes as good as another great decaff , Eight O'Clock Coffee , 100 % Colombian Decaf Whole Bean , 12-Ounce Bags ( Pack of 4 ) . Caffeine is linked to an increased risk in diabetes so its just another of those little things to try and do to stay healthy .	1
I buy this on the subscribe & save program , which seems to be discontinued at this time . I have had about 4 shipments of 6 bags each . My sister and I enjoy this coffee everyday ! I alternate a shipment to her and then to me . Perfect for moments when you are the only one drinking it , and do n't want to waste coffee or time to fill up a regular coffeemaker . I use it at work , because I 'm the only one who drinks decaff .	1
I use this in a Keurig coffee maker , using the adaptor cup . It works fine , and the coffee is good . Although the Keurig is nice and convenient , it is not the cheapest way to get a cup of coffee . Using these pods cuts the cost about in half.I like this dark roast and will continue to buy it . The taste of coffee , like the taste of anything else , is a personal preference . I like it , but you might hate it . The pods , though , are reasonably-priced and work well with my Keurig .	1
Senseo Douwe Egbert Coffee , including regular , decaffeinated , and flavored , is delicious ! A bit on the strong side , but rich in flavor . The foam on top adds to its enjoyment . Just wish that the coffee required only one pod and would brew a large mug .	1
I never have a bad cup of Senseo , which I consider our backup to the Keurig machine and cups . It 's simpler and cheaper -- and good .	1
Douwe Egberts makes some of the most delicious European coffee . When the Senseo Single Serve Coffee Maker was created , these single use , disposable coffee 'pods ' fit together like hand in glove . 5,000,000 European coffee lovers can not be wrong ... Senseo Douwe Egberts is outstanding , fresh tasting coffee , and each imported 4 pack , ( 72 Single-Serve pods ) , comes attractively packaged in a resealable pouch.Medium roast is apt to be a particular favorite for American coffee tastes . It has a rich , full-bodied flavor , neither bitter nor astringent . The Senseo coffee machine can make 1 4 oz cup , 2 4 oz cups , or a single 8 oz cup at a time . The self-contained pods use a tea bag filter-type paper and are approximately 2 & quot ; in diameter.Right now , the price averages 25 cents per 4 ounce cup . The Senseo makes it with a bit of frothe on the top , and this medium roast coffee is fine straight up , or try it with a little sweetner and a dollop of Hazelnut creamer as I do.I do envision the price point coming down a bit , as the Senseo system becomes the US equivalent of the European sensation . Douwe Egberts recommends using your pods within 2 weeks , however , I 've had good luck storing the extras in the freezer section of my refrigerator with no dicernable flavor change .	1
The medium roast pods make for a delicious cup of coffee . So convenient , too , with my single serve HB coffee maker .	1
I am now a coffee drinker , I love the ease of these pods and the taste is quality- if you want it stronger just add two pods , will order again when I run ot	1
We drink Senseo Douwe Egberts coffee in my house every day . I usually use one pod for my morning coffee , and a `` double '' on the weekend . While I like all the varieties , medium roast is my favorite . We buy it by the 4-pack case in my house.The coffee has good body and is not bitter . I take mine with cream and sugar , but it is so easy to drink I could even go without and it still tastes great to me . The pod system is so clean and easy too . I love the fact that there is no cleanup . I think it would work especially well for someone who doesnt normally drink coffee but would like to have something nice when guests come over . Because the pods come in small lined bags , it stays fresh longer .	1
Excellent decaf that can go toe-to-toe with some caffeinated coffees . Rich tasting with no bitterness . A must purchase if you have a Senseo and want to go decaf.I just wish they would offer more options for decaf , such as some different flavored coffees ( hazelnut in particular ) . As it stands , this is the one and only decaf offering from Senseo . I have to make my own pods if I want something different ( not hard to do , and cheaper , but I do like the convenience of the pre-made pods ) .	1
Why buy your Senseo pods at the grocery store when you can get them from Amazon @ a much lower price and , if you order $ 25 or more , they 're shipped free ! I buy 4 boxes at a time , and because they 're vacuum-sealed , they 're all fresh down to the last one .	1
If you like your coffee dark and flavorful , strong and smooth without bitterness , this is the right choice for the Senseo Coffeemaker . I have tried a number of substitutes and all have been disappointing .	1
We purchased a Senseo coffee machine shortly after my son `` borrowed '' my Bunn coffee maker in March with the promise to get his own as he strolled out the door . Since I was the only person in the household drinking coffee regularly anymore instead of buying another Bunn and wasting half a pot of coffee every time I made a fresh pot of coffee , I thought I should at least look at the single cup coffee makers . I then promptly set off on a mission to find the coffee that `` rocked my boat '' given the fact that I was a sworn dunkin donut coffee drinker for years.I am not terribly fond of flavored coffees in general although they are nice to have on occassion , so I tried all of the Senseo coffees and eventually found that the Kenya Blend was the best of the lot given my individual taste for coffees.And then they came out with the breakfast blend . This makes a superb cup of coffee and it has effectively ended my murmurings for Dunkin Donut to get on board with Senseo and make a pod coffee just for the Senseo . Well ... maybe that is a slight exaggeration . I would still like Dunkin Donuts to team with Senseo and make a pod coffee but that only because I would like to have two superb coffee pods to chose from with one being the Senseo Breakfast Blend .	1
This is a basic & # 34 ; good & # 34 ; coffee ( never bitter ) . Not quite as strong as I prefer but good none the less . I 'll probably buy the dark roast next time .	1
One downside of a Senseo machine , is that unless you want an espresso size cup of coffee , you need to make 2 cups , which means you need two pods , at around 5.69 and bag for 18 pods , it can get pricey . The dark roast solves the problem . You put one in , and you make two cups ! Before I found the Senseo , I was an average folgers , yuban mild coffee drinking type . I have the value pack on amazon grocery as a subscription ... works out great ! !	1
Still a great cup of coffee , We love the flavor of this coffee , it 's expensive compared to canned coffee but well worth it , we take it with us when we travel along with our Senseo coffee maker , So we always have a great cup of coffee in the hotel room ...	1
We were VERY disappointed when we found out that grocery stores have stopped carrying Sensor Coffee Pods . Such a shame the pricier coffee & # 34 ; pods & # 34 ; have taken over the market !	1
If you are looking for a really dark , intense Starbucks like brew , this is not that strong . It suits me perfectly .	1
I love Senseo decaf , its a great coffee with strong flavor ! Always happy with senseo coffee 's from Amazon , ships very fast and always fresh !	1
Breakfast blend is hands-down the best Senseo blend . And Amazon offers them at a great price . I would highly recommend . Not as intense as dark blend , but still very bold tasting . Sometimes the darker blends , even medium , have a bit of an acidic taste or a sharp , tongue-piercing taste . The Breakfast Blend is a perfect balance of strength , taste , aroma , and intensity .	1
A very rich taste especially with the foam at the top . I almost became addicted to this coffee . I was drinking way too much caffeine . But the flavor is fabulous with lots of body . I have now just talked myself into having a cup.EW	1
I like this one cup coffee brand pods . It is smooth and not harsh . I like the taste . If you like really strong coffee then this may not be for you . Senseo is a good brand and not easy to find at a good price . ( I believe that they	1
It is a pleasure to order a six-pack of Senseo coffee pods from Amazon ! We have owned a couple of Phillips coffee makers and have used Senseo pods for years . So many times when I try to buy them at our local grocery stores , they are out of stock or the price is just too high . So , Amazon is to the rescue again ... in quantity , price , and fast delivery !	1
Other formats of coffee machines have pretty much taken over the market , and Senseo pods are difficult and expensive to purchase locally . We use our Senseo machine on a daily basis , and still enjoy the coffee it makes .	1
I love the convenience of Senseo pods -- pop 'em in , fill the water tank , and press the start button . The dark roast is my favorite , but I wish Senseo would come out with a French roast and other darker , richer varieties . I know there 's a Senseo espresso now , but it requries purchasing an espresso pod holder , so I have n't tried it yet . Perhaps it would work in my regular two-pod holder if I used one espresso pod and one dark roast pod ... have n't tried it yet . That works with other pod brands that I sometimes use with the Senseo pods -- one of each in the two-pod holder . I tried Senseo Sumatra , but did n't go back ; less satisfying than the dark roast . We go through six to eight Senseo pods daily at my house , so I take advantage of the handy automatic order process through Amazon . I love serving Senseo dark roast coffee to guests . They 're always impressed by the foamy head and fresh-made taste and aroma . It 's good coffee , but I sure would like more darker , stronger varieties .	1
Okay ... so I am new to Senseo and ALL of its varieties of coffees . The machine came with a sample of Dark Roast . It 's not that the roast itself was bad , it just tasted `` flat '' - none of the overtones of the nectar of the gods - and I was sorely disappointed . However , I was on a mission to make 1 cup at a time , having reviewed all the other 1 cup machines out there I was sure that Senseo was not just the best deal , but the best machine - and then ... when all hope seemed lost ... a light at the end of the tunnel was seen and at its core was Medium Roast . This stuff is good coffee people ! You can taste the nuances and hints of floral , chocolately , nutty , and all those other words that go with describing good coffee ... so I highly recommend these pods . They taste wonderful and will have you returning to the Senseo for another cup before work begins ... FIVE STARS ! ! !	1
November 1st , 2013 editedI really wish that the Subscribe & Save will be re-introduced for this product . So many time it was unavailable and one had to order in the last minute another brand . PLEASE AMAZON , bring back a RELIABLE S & S ; system to your loyal customers . Thanks so much !	1
Senseo coffee system came way back before the multiple brands of pod type coffeemakers came on the scene.However I have to say if you are not in need to brew a whole pot in order to function ... ..and it is just the two of you , and you love rich gourmet coffee ; and reasonably priced ... ... .you will love it !	1
When I bought the senseo machine , I decided to order the Dark Roast and Expresso coffee bags in the same time.First off , both taste quite similar.Also , as I did discover with the Expresso , I can get at least one large coffee out of one bag and even squeeze a third small coffee out of it.Am I satisfied ? Yes I am !	1
I use the senseo pods in my Hamilton One Cup Brewer , the brewer cost only $ 19.00 and it makes the best tasting coffee no matter what type you buy , I like the coffee mix with 10 % Kona and my husband likes the decaffinated . Taste like European coffee	1
We were among the first owners of a free Senseo coffeemaker way back like 10 or more years ago . We have a white machine in our laundryroom & then bought my husband a black one for work . Soooooooo I guess you could say we looooooove this coffee/method of making it , & medium roast is the best . I recently saw Douwe Egberts non-pod coffee @ a local gourmet shop & it was like $ 9 something for 12oz ! Good to know one can get the coffee to use in a regular drip pot as well , however , @ that price , I guess we will just continue to have this as `` treat coffee '' via our machine.All this being said , I would like to say that @ both Target & Walmart here in Buffalo , NY area stores , I can get the pods for $ 4.24 each . However , when Target in particular , wants to rotate stock , they mark it down to the wonderful price of $ 4 ! ! ! ! ! Needless to say , I buy them out , go to another store & do the same . That 's almost $ 4 less for 6 bags than Amazon sells it for ! ! ! ! I encourage all of you Senseoholics to do the same & check out the above mentioned stores . I wish Amazon would stop reminding me it 's so cheap , when they do n't mark it down to Target 's level .	1
I previously had purchased this as part of a pack with 4 flavors . I enjoy this one and the Kona blend the most . Though the Kona blend is my favorite , this is a good runner-up . It 's a solid blend , not too strong , not too weak . It does n't really have any subtle nuances or anything , but it is a good starter coffee for your day .	1
Has anyone been to Starbucks lately ? They charge four bucks for a nice cup of coffee.But this Senseo coffee costs about 33 cents a cup , and it 's just as good as Starbucks , if not better . 108 tea pods for a little over 35 bucks.This might put Starbucks out of business. [ ... ]	1
My husband loves this rich , robust dark roast coffee . We agree it is much better than Starbucks and we love the pricing . It is not as strong or leaves a chicory aftertaste like Starbucks . I am a fan too , but prefer the medium roast . Either way you can not lose . Santa brought us a Senseo coffee machine with the Dark and Medium Roast Pods . Of course , Santa would chose the perfect strength for each of us !	1
We like the pods more than the wasteful kcup brewers . The Senseo medium roast makes a good cup of coffee . It 's not harsh , weak or bitter . It 's hard to find coffee pods these days but I like our Bunn brewer and will keep buying these Senseo pods .	1
The dark roast is good coffee . Never liked the other flavors . Well , the decaf is OK. Super Saver Subscription brings price down to about $ 0.22 per cup of coffee . And Senseo means it 's always fresh . Occasionally one pod in a pack will have ripped open ( in transit , or from manufacturer ) . This makes a mess of the other pods and will result in the occasional extra gritty bits in your coffee . Call Senseo if this happens , and they 'll send you a coupon for another bag .	1
I 'm not going to talk about the quality of the coffee ; after all , that 's an entirely subjective opinion that 's impossible to form from reading reviews . ( For the record , I like Senseo coffee , including this medium roast decaf variety . ) However , if you decide to buy this , you should definitely consider signing up for the subscription service . Here 's why : First , the price is discounted 15 % from the regular Amazon price , and the shipping is free , even if the order does n't meet the normal $ 25 threshold . In my area , I almost never see Senseo pods in stores for less than $ 4.50 , even on sale , so the subscription-discounted Amazon price represents a significant saving.Second , you can adjust ( or cancel ) your subscription at any time -- even after only one shipment . When you sign up , you 'll get an e-mail explaining where to look on your account page for the subscription options.So , at an interval of your choosing , a package of coffee pods will arrive , discounted 15 % than the normal Amazon price in effect at that time and shipped for free . Your credit card wo n't be charged until each shipment date , and you can cancel at any time.Life is good .	1
I bought just one bag the first time but liked it so much that I came back for a 4 pack . I do n't like strong coffee so I make 2 cups from 1 pod . It works great in my automatic drip coffeemaker too , so no need to buy a special coffeemaker to use it .	1
Out of the five coffee 's I use in the morning , I like this one the best . I also use the dark , espresso , the world mix and I 've tried the coffee duck ( it makes a mess ) . The breakfast blend is always reliable .	1
I love this coffee ! It brews very well in the Senseo coffee maker . The reason I can not give this 5 stars is the high price .	1
this was discontinued and is not available in the US as far as I know . If Amazon can get it , I would love to buy more .	1
We got a Senseo machine 5 years ago as a gift from a friend and would never go back to regular drip coffee . This is full , rich , and has a wonderful little foam on top .	1
I have a Hamilton Beach On the Go one cup brewer . These pods are perfect for it . I like the coffee . It is not as bold as I had expected , but I do like it . I went from needing cream and sugar in coffee ( because I never measured properly and ended up with either too strong or weak coffee ) to being able to drink these black . Wish there was more consistency in the price . I have to watch it all the time to see whether or not it will be going back to a reasonable price ( ~ $ 25 ) .	1
I really love the convenience of having automatic shipments ; and signing up for this service enabled me to get a great price as well . It is terribly hard to find coffee pods in any of the grocery stores anymore and decaf is next to impossible to find . Thank you Amazon.com for providing the product I 've been looking for .	1
This is definitely a nice treat in the morning . Not too strong , slightly sweet undertones . I definitely recommend it !	1
Here 's the thing : the one-cup Senseo coffeemakers for which this pod is designed have proved unreliable . I would n't buy any more of them . But these pods are fabulous.I got these nearly two years ago for my Senseo pod coffeemaker that lasted for all of 30 uses . Junk , crap . But these pods have proved the opposite . They have outstanding flavor , even when they ought to be stale . Usually I have brewed coffee but when I run out and it does n't make sense to make another pot , I put fresh water in a cup , add one of these and heat it in the microwave . Presto ! A cup of java to which I add my 1 % milk and enjoy . I am simply amazed that I can get such a good cuppa from a non-refrigerated , long-opened package , coffee pod !	1
I like their coffee pods a lot , I drink it every morning . Have not tried a variety yet that I did not enjoy . Will continue to buy them , I prefer it over any other coffee I have available here at home . Good product !	1
This coffee is great and I have had my Senseo for years . I am unable to find the pods locally anymore , so on subscribe and save through Amazon . Love the foam on top of the coffee , I do n't even want regular coffee anymore since I found Senseo years ago .	1
I have been enjoying this coffee maker for a while and every flavor has been spectacular . I order a package every month and can not imagine myself without this . Thanks a lot .	1
I switch between the dark roast and medium roast . I think that both make a great cup of coffee . This is definately the easiest system to use and really makes cleanup a snap .	1
OK so most people seem to like this coffee ; it 's got a strong rating ( 4 1/2 at the moment ) , but there are still those that say they do n't . It will always be subjective ; many people detest Starbucks coffee , but millions more like it . Some like it bold , some like it weak , some like it mild , some like it bitter , some like it sweet ; no way to please everyone.This coffee is on the mild side , meaning it has flavor but its not overpowering , and is moreso on the sweeter side , meaning it 's not bitter like diner-house coffee . The great thing about this flavor is that it blends excellent for those that like to flavor their coffee ; because it is not bitter but still has a noticeable coffee flavor , it compliments most flavored creamers . I 've had many many different types of coffees with many different types of creamers , and it can be a real balancing act to find the right blends . The senseo medium roast so far has been the best `` starting point '' , meaning nobody I 've personally made coffee for has said anything but complimentary things about it . Some still like a more bold or bitter coffee , but so far nobody has said poor things about this coffee . I use a single pod in approx . 6oz of coffee in a cheap Hamilton Beach drip machine with filtered water , and it turns out great.One other thing , sometimes batches taste 'slightly ' different from one-another ; it 's a product from a plant when all is said and done , and while controls are put into place to regulate the taste , sometimes batches are slightly more bold or bitter than another , it happens with all manufacturers ( including Folgers and other large manufacturers , which I 've personally tasted radical variations ) . I 've ordered this 6-pack around 6 times so far , and only one batch was slightly odd tasting ( had a much more noticeable/bitter flavor to it ) , other than that it has been very consistent . I left the bag slightly open on that batch , in essence making it `` go flat '' so it was n't so bitter . While these packets are sealed , make sure you store them in a sealed container after opening to preserve the flavor.One other thing to watch out for : increasing costs . This pack is still a great deal on Amazon , but I am worried since they have made the decision to pull from retail outlets that it will increase in cost on Amazon as well . I still love this coffee , but if it goes up to $ 40 for a 6-pack of this , I may be rethinking the coffee I purchase . Keep it low in cost and at the same level of flavor and we 'll all be happy .	1
I use this regularly . It has a great flavor and when ordered through Amazon , it is usually less expensive than purchasing in a grocery store . A good bargain with great taste .	1
On a scale of 1-10 , I 'd give Senseo Medium Roast pods about an eighteen . It suits my taste fine . We call it my & # 34 ; Ah ! & # 34 ; Coffee . My wife pointed out that I always say & # 34 ; Ah ! ' after my first sip.Good stuff , Maynard !	1
My wife and I brew and drink a cup of Senseo Medium Roast coffee everyday -- have done so for years . We almost always buy it from Amazon.com and find the price to be best there .	1
If you enjoy the regular Senseo pods and like a lighter coffee you will enjoy this one .	1
I love this coffee and think it is the best ! ! Amazon offers the best deals on it ! !	1
`` Someone gave me a Senseo machine , so I bought this coffee . I 'm very disappointed with the taste ! It 's bland and dull tasting . Too bad , as I have 4 bags now ! `` This was my previous review . Since then , I gave away the Senseo machine , but I kept the coffee and use it in a cup of hot water I do in the microwave . The coffee is actually good . I guess somehow the machine flavored it . Maybe it 's because the water does n't sit in the coffee for long enough . Using my microwave method , I let the coffee bag brew awhile before pressing it and removing it -- very good taste . Go figure ! Anyway , I 'd recommend this coffee as microwavable bags .	1
I find I need to add two pods to my single cup coffee maker to get a good tasting coffee . One pod is a little weak.The taste is pleasant , and well rounded . I just wish they made them a little stronger.My de facto coffee comes from a 12 cup coffee maker , I fall back on using these pods if I only have time for a single cup , or need to make a quick brew for a visitor . For everyday use , using 2 pods per cups , would be expensive . These pods are very convenient , but not cost effective is you like your coffee strong .	1
I love this coffee system but finding the pods is becoming more difficult now . The price is right , the delivery is fast and you can order a case so I always have coffee when I need it .	1
Also this coffee can be purchased at Target for $ 3.99	1
Senseo Dark Roast pods provide a strong , vibrant flavor that seems to me to be similar to the Starbucks regular brand , I limit myself to two cups per day and really prefer this more robust variety of coffee . I am not disappointed by the brew and find it saisfying . Using Amazon 's Subscribe and Save Plan helps my budget and is completely convenient .	1
Unlike the Mild Breakfast Blend , this coffee is not from Brazil as far as I know . I use two pods for around 12 oz of coffee , but I use 1 of these , the medium roast , and 1 of the mild . To me , that 's the best coffee I have and I have a LOT of coffee in my house , all kinds . The combination I just mentioned is my personal favorite .	1
A friend bought us some Amber Lyn chocolate since she knew my hubby loves chocolate yet is a diabetic -- WOW were we impressed with the taste ! I also love chocolate but HATE the normal sugar free variety as the synthetic sweetener always upsets my digestion , plus they have a non-smooth consistancy -- this chocolate does NOT upset my delicate system , and is very good and GUILT FREE ! Update : I have removed 1 star from my rating -- The variety pack includes a bar with `` chocolate bits '' - this one crumbles like other sugar free chocolates and is not pleasant to eat - reminds me of Monica on Friends trying to make `` mokolate '' taste good in recipes ... .	1
Really really nice chocolates . Full rich flavor , sweet enough but not overwhelmingly so . As you probably know , dark chocolates have some special health benefits , so they make for a nice occasional treat . And being sugar free means I can enjoy them as a diabetic . I gave these to a couple of friends and they really enjoyed them as well and wanted to know where to get them .	1
Excellent alternative for those of us who love quality dark chocolate , but can ' [ t seem to find that quality in the grocery store . We tasted a sample at Costco , but did n't buy nearly enough . So glad we were able to find it on Amazon	1
A W E S O M E ! and guiltless to boot ! I 'm ordering more this season .	1
Bought these to make truffles but I could n't get my husband to stop eating them : ) !	1
I discovered Amber Lyn chocolate about 9 months ago and was floored by just how good this sugar free dark chocolate was . Some people find the maltitol objectionable and its true that some folks have a harder time with its digestion , however , other sweeteners have their own issues as well , not the least of which is how it affects the taste of the product . I 'm not diabetic but I have friends who are , I am however , a life long struggler with weight and avoidance of sugar goes a long way to making that battle more productive . But being a chocolate lover , that was always a trade off till I found this product , the taste is downright sublime and satisfies far more so than even other gourmet chocolates made with sugar . I experimented with various brands of sugar free chocolates , but at the risk of sounding like a chocolate snob , IMO those should 've come labled `` taste compromised '' . Amber Lyn 's is a taste that is pure satisfaction , a single bar is so satisfying in its taste and mouth-feel that often , it will last me 3 days as I nibble on it for a desert rather than devour it ( though that temptation is definitely there ) . My diabetic friends have all upon exposure to its taste , promptly placed orders themselves and not one has had anything even remotely negative to say about it.Finally , a note regarding their customer service . I live in Las Vegas where the general rule is if you 're ordering food online , either avoid ordering heat sensitive goods from March to September or make sure you can get extra care in shipping . A craving overcame my normal precaution about this and I placed a order just as temps were hitting 100 degrees and carrier trucks are often 10 degrees hotter inside . I was fully expecting a molten mess to arrive at my door as I had spaced off my normal precautions regarding such a order , yet the package arrived in a sytrofoam lined box with cold gel packs wrapped in paper between the chocolate containers . My order was literally in pristine condition and totally without any say so on my end , they just knew to take that extra step for their customer . That is a very rare level of service these days and Amber Lyn cemented my loyalty for life with that move.Bottom line : If you 're looking for quality , taste , and satisfaction not just for your taste buds but for your presence as a customer , I can not recommend these people enough . If all corporations were this dedicated to customer satisfaction , a lot of lawyers would be out of a job .	1
What a yummy little cookie . I remember these on my flight . I even saved the wrapper to ensure I buy the right kind . These are it . Delicious with coffee or milk !	1
My wife picked up a couple of packages of these cookies from the local grocer ( Kroger ) . They were on sale , 2/ $ 5 , much cheaper then what they sell for on here . Anyway , a wonderful cookie that is like a crisp ginger cookie . They go great with coffee . Try your local grocer in the imported food section and if you do n't see them , ask them to start stocking them , you will be hooked on these little pieces of heaven .	1
Oh , I 'm so glad to have found these on Amazon ! Our local independent grocer carries them during the holidays , and we just finished the last of the ones we 've been hoarding since last December . These have a very soft , pleasant taste that grows on you . One of these shortly before bedtime makes me feel calm , relaxed and quite self-indulgent , although they 're actually more nutritious than you might think . A very desirable item to stock in the pantry for last-minute entertaining , or to bring along when visiting a sick friend or a shut-in . They 're actually good for settling a shaky stomach ( must be the ginger and/or cinnamon ? ! ) , which may be one reason Delta gives them out as in-flight snacks . They 're fabulous with a dish of ice cream or fresh fruit , or with port , brandy , cream sherry or a liqueur after dinner . They work well as an item for elegant receptions . We like to offer them at dinner parties along with coffee and dessert . Unlike many cookies , they go as well with morning , afternoon or evening tea as with coffee , and of course they 're marvelous on their own . I 've only ordered the five-packs before and am delighted to see this ten-pack here at a better price . Hooray ! If you have n't tried them yet , maybe you 'd like to : I bet you 'll love them as much as we do !	1
These are the same cookies that they serve on some airlines ( Delta , I think , still does ) -- but they only give you two cookies ! If you want more of these things than you can possibly eat , order this pack . You can even give packages away to friends or strangers on the street and still have plenty for yourself.I love these cookies , but eating 320 of them has satisfied me for quite some time .	1
These Biscoff cookies are the VERY BEST ... Just great with coffee . As a matter of fact they are good with Ice Cream and many other deserts . I even snack on them while watching TV . If you have not tried them please do and you will not regret it.I buy them in packages of many individually wrapped cookies . They do n't last long . I try to hide them .	1
First had these cookies when we flew first class last month ... .happy to find them on Amazon . They are perfect to have with coffee , tea or alone for a treat . I would highly recommend them .	1
I was introduced to Biscoff when traveling and have been hooked ever since . My husband says they are the best cookie to dunk in his coffee . A great crunchy sweet treat , more like a biscuit than a cookie .	1
My entire family very love this cookie , even my a little niece ; she ate couple pieces everyday . It 's taste really good when you serve with tea .	1
Had these cookies on flight to Washington DC and just had to order them . They arrived ahead of scheduled time , intact , and every bit as good as I remembered .	1
We tried this biscuits on the plane and like it . Ordered through Amazon several times , taste nice and it has nice crunch to it . The only complaint is the packaging as at least a quarter of the cookies came broken .	1
I saw the reviews for it while I was looking for some international snacks on Amazon and everyone really liked it so I ordered it and it was well worth the wait . They 're elegantly made , being flattened but slightly curvy , light in weight and texture but definitely crispy when you bite into them . They 're like thin biscotti in that they 're crispy and light and they 're better to eat when you dunk them in your coffee or tea and they 're not too sweet and they have slightly gingery/cinnamon ( but not overpowering ) taste . They 're like elegant gourmet lightly made ginger cookies - I can see why everyone loves them ! I buy them regularly for my mom . Fortunately , I 've found that our local Walgreen 's has them all the time - they 're that popular ! ! Giving them to a friend would be like giving your friend a very special treat . I would definitely buy them again ! !	1
Imported Pecorino Romano - 3 PoundsI do n't care what the others say . This is good stuff.Beats Kraft , hands down .	1
I still have some of this in my freezer , but will be buying more from this seller . Even with the shipping cost , it 's a great bargain . I cut it into smaller pieces , vacuum sealed them and tossed them into the freezer . Now I can take out a chunk at a time instead of hunting locally for some that is usually WAY overpriced and dried out.Very good cheese at a very good price .	1
Terrific flavor and very reasonable price . We have purchased this twice and will continue . We use on pizza and spaghetti	1
This pecorino romano was a little younger than I expected . Not a truly hard cheese that crumbles , but sufficiently aged so that it grates well . It also shaves nicely.Because it was a little younger than pecorino romano I 've had before , it did n't have such a sharp salty taste . But it had a taste that I did n't expect -- something like a strong cheddar with a nutty quality . The first thing I did with it was grate some over pasta with a little olive oil and parsley . The result was ... well , swoon material . Mac and cheese for grown ups . And yes it 's great on pasta with sauce , as well as egg tacos , been soup , hamburgers and just melted on morning toast.I think the price is good , and I 'm definitely going to get more.If you 're a cheese lover , particularly if you 're f0nd of Asiago , I suggest you give this a try . It 's a great alternative .	1
This is great Romano cheese ! and the price is affordable . I 'm so happy Amazon carries it . I recently moved from NY , where it is so easy to find italian products , because there are alot of italians , but where i moved Illinois , its very hard to find italian products or if they are found , the price is really over the top , and for me that only cook italian , cheese is mandatory , in almost every recipe.I higly reccomend I will certainly reorder . I did reorder this cheese back in August , because of the extreme heat , it arrived very soft , so I immediately put it in the refrigerator , but although it got a little firmer , it remained kind of soft , when I grated it , it just crumbled , instead of having that grated look . Romano cheese is supposed to be a hard dry cheese , it never crumbles , this cheese is too fresh to grate , it has n't been aged enough , and it goes rather quickly , my order of 6 pounds in late August , is already gone . I do n't think I will reorder again , because it 's not really dry enough to grate and very oily .	1
I thought it was a typo ; 3 pounds of Pecorino cheese for 15 dollars . Do the math , that 's 5 dollars a pound . It arrived super fast . It was super fresh . I just made some pasta and grated some of this fine cheese on top . I thought I had been teleported to Italy . Magnifico ! Pecorino like this is hard to find . Buy it before it 's gone or they raise the price .	1
A secret I have had for years is using sour cream and ricotta in my cheesecake ( well , except for when I was vegan , but anyway ... back to vegetarian now ... ) Although most recipes do n't use it , you will DIE for the taste difference when you try it.Most cheesecake is heavy and pasty . Using sour cream makes the lightest and creamiest cheesecake you 'll imagine . People have no idea how you did it , but they will go wild and you will wind up making them for Christmas presents each year.So , how do you gourmet-up the crust ? Amaretti cookies , of course . Well , sure you may want to buy it for the tin alone to keep on your counter or simply for snacking and filing up your sweet tooth by unpeeling their delicate wrappers and enjoying the almond-like flavor -- but let 's get to a recipe you can use if you want to get creative here:3 oz ( about 20 ) Amaretti Cookies2 oz ( about 4 whole crackers ) Honey Graham Crackers , coarsely crushedPinch of Salt5 tbsp butter , melted1 tsp Unflavored Powdered Gelatin3/4 cup chilled heavy Cream2 ( 8 oz ea ) Cream Cheese , softened3/4 cup Ricotta Cheese3/4 cup Sugar1/4 cup Sour Cream1/4 cup Fresh Lemon JuiceDirections : To Make Crust : Preheat oven to 350.1 . In food processor or blender , pulse the cookies , graham crackers , and salt until finely ground.2 . Transfer the crumbs to a small bowl and stir in the butter.3 . Press the crumbs evenly over the bottom and halfway up the side of an 8 in springform pan.4 . Bake for about 10 minutes , until the crust is set . Cool on a rack.To Make Cheesecake:1 . In a microwave dish , sprinkle the gelatin over 2 tbsp of cold water . Let stand until the gelatin is softened ( about 10 minutes ) .2 . Meanwhile , in a small bowl , beat heavy cream until soft peaks form , refrigerate.3 . In another bowl , beat the cream cheese , ricotta , sugar and salt with an electric mixer on high until light and fluffy ( about 5 minutes ) .4 . Beat in the sour cream and lemon juice.5 . Microwave the gelatin until melted ( 5 seconds ) .6 . Scrap gelatin into the cream cheese mixture and beat until fully mixed.7 . Fold in the whipped heavy cream.8 . Pour the mixture into the cooled crust and smooth the surface.9 . Refrigerate the cake until firm and set ( 3 hours ) .These cookies are packaged in pretty pastel paper wrappers individually so they are lovely for putting in a bowl when having a party , but even as a snack right out of the tin they are sweet but not too sweet with a crisp texture and the taste of amaretto .	1
I 've loved these flavorful almond flavored ( apricot seed ) aromatic cookies for decades . These inimitable Lazzaroni treats are delicious with tea , coffee , or alone , in cold weather or hot . They imbue an extra bit of pleasure to viewing the abundant delights ofTwo Fat Ladiesenjoying life and food with humor and gusto . The attractive Italian tin happens to be a very useful decorative object for goody-storage . We appreciate that these cookies ship well even in hot weather , and they arrive unbroken , protected by the tin . When you open the lid , a scent like amaretto liqueur wafts up . Enjoy !	1
Many people consider these a staple to be kept in the pantry . Not only do they make a great cookie , but you can bake with them , using the crumbled cookies for toppings , pie crusts , crumbs etc.I figure everyone has probably already tried these but , if you have n't , they are a classic Italian type meringue like almond cookie puff . They are sweet but still retain a lot of the real , nutty , very slightly bitter almond qualities of real almonds . The come wrapped in pretty little twisted paper wrappers , making it easy to throw one or two packets into your lunch bag . They are super-light but still satisfying . I 've never met anyone of any age who disliked them , either , which is another reason they are good to keep on hand , because your guests will be happy even if these are the only cookies you have .	1
My first encounter with these darling little treats was while watching Everyday Italian on the Food Network starring Giada De Laurentiis , my favorite chef of the past few years . She crumbled them into deserts , coffees , made pumpkin ravioli with it , baked amaretti apples and always praised their magical taste . Upon finally purchasing a box myself I was blown away by the hypnotic and addictive taste of marzipan in these little gems.Amaretti Cookies are packed as a pair , wrapped in wax paper with Italian writing and insignias , praising its originality . They are two small crackling cookies per wrapper and they are a crunchy shell of delight . The taste is strangely addictive , after having a few I could n't stop thinking about them ! I have even purchased three more boxes two days after getting the first one . They taste like the holidays , spicy and lusciously laden with almonds and crispy sugary goodness with a tiny tang of bitterness of the almond . They flavor is royal and time stopping , on busy days , one bite of this cookie and I am transfixed into magical fields of luxurious old world taste that has been popular to Italians for years.Incredibly aromatic crispy almond cookies that are a luscious addiction to coffee , tea or wine and are great for cooking and baking with . They really grew on me , I think I am an addict to their taste now , no wonder Giada is so smitten with them ! - Kasia S .	1
Bought this for tea time . Authentic and yummy . Love the reusable tin . My packaged was shipped quickly and packaged well for shipment . No broken cookies . Each cookie is individually wrapped . Crisp and fresh and not too sweet . These are authentic . I do recommend these cookies and this seller . It 'll be buying more .	1
When I purchased a Keurig , my concern was that I could not use my all time favorite coffee , Illy . However , after finally finding the right replacement cup , I am able to brew Illy perfectly ! !	1
We use Illy in both drip and espresso machines . Their darker roasts are wonderful , not bitter , and form a nice crema when used in our espresso machines.Drink Illy any time of the day -- use decaf at night as needed ! Do not feel pressured to buy whole beans and grind them every day . This ground coffee is great ! The Illy canisters are vacuum-sealed and have a long shelf life . Buy several at a time if you see a good price , and enjoy !	1
Confession : I have been a true fan of Starbucks . I used to think Starbucks was the best coffee ever and the many bags of Starbucks in my pantry will prove that ! However , I recently received a gift of a half pound ofilly Caffe Normale Drip/Medium Grind ( Blue Band ) Coffee , 8.8 Ounce Tins ( Pack of 2 ) and I was for once in my life , truly impressed with the quality , flavor , and aroma of this coffee . I also find this to be heartbreaking as I do not know what to do with all my Starbucks that I have on hand . I just gave 3 pounds of my Starbucks to my mother-in-law since I will not be drinking it anymore . If you are a true coffee conesseiur then you will love Illy coffee . If I ever open a coffee shop , I would be more than happy to invest in this company .	1
The Illy company was set up in 1933 in Italy by a Hungarian officer who had come to Trieste with the Austro-Hungarian Army during World War I , and stayed . Today , the company remains with the Illy family , with the founder 's grandson at the helm . They have 700 employees and sell their brand in over 100 countries . The company uses only Arabica beans , purchased directly from the farmer , rather then the middleman , and produces only one superiour blend.So much for Google info ; o ) ... Now , here is my personal Illy `` journey '' : I am down to only one cup of coffee a day and so I need its taste to be perfect ( quality vs quantity ) . I like my coffee very strong , but dread the bitter aftertaste many strong brands induce ( Starbucks would be one ) . I was introduced to Illy by a co-worker a few years ago , and have not looked back ... It provides the strength I crave , with a sweet and smooth aftertaste . Yes , this coffee will grow hair on your chest ( figuratively ... ) . The coffee is packed in air free conditions ( with nitrogen gas ) , to help preserve the taste . When you pull of the inner metal seal , you will hear the air hissing its way into the can . The metal cap is a twist off . It is designed to be air tight as well , to prolong the freshness after the can has been opened.Regarding the brewing process : for a decade now I have been using the French press exclusively ( I believe it delivers a stronger/sweeter brew ) . I find the medium grind/medium roast `` blue band '' Illy to be perfect for the purpose . The instructions on the back of the can help you with coffee to water ratio for both the drip machine and the French press . Do not over-agitate the French press after brewing and you will be ok. Alternately , you may purchase whole Illy beans and grind them to your satisfaction ( sadly , I am too lazy for that ... ) .Regarding Amazon price and service : Illy is not easy to find in certain parts of the country . Where I live , it requires a trip to the local mall ... So , I was happy to find that Amazon offered this product at the same price as my mall , with the cost free , directly to my door , service . The item arrived promptly , with the `` open by '' date fourteen months away . I am a happy customer ! I hope the coffee will work for you as well !	1
Just purchased this at Safeway for $ 15.99 per 8.8 oz . can which of course is $ 31.98 for the two that Amazon is offering here for more than $ 35.00 ( too expensive ) however for ready ground coffee it is AMAZING . It actually smells and tastes as if one had just put it through the grinder seconds before it went into the machine .	1
Recommended by Oprah and I agree ! Delicious !	1
This is an excellent product , easy to make and true to the shop 's most popular item . I find it very difficult to get true chocolate flavor from almost any manufactured item , it always seems to be missing that deep flavor . I was pleasantly surprised with Serendipity , they nailed it . The cost is a little high but I do n't think you could do any better price-wise at home buying all the different kinds of chocolates used . The best way to describe the flavor is deep cocoa . It 's rich and dark , like hot chocolate . It tastes nothing at all like a milkshake although it 's is cold . The canister is a nice improvement over the pouches , you get to customize the flavor a little easier . Because of the cost , it 's a once in a while treat for us and it is a favorite . Buy with confidence , it 's a delicious product .	1
Simply delicious	1
If you were to imagine drinking hot chocolate in an ice storm , that might be close to the experience of smooth chocolaty bliss merging with ice crystals slipping through a straw and melting onto your tongue.Ingredients : Sugar , non-fat dry milk , dextrose and cocoas processed with alkali . The blend of cocoa powders is especially rich and smooth.This is a super fast dessert to make because all you do is put milk ( even nonfat milk works ) in a blender , add the packet of cocoa and then blend with a few cups of ice.Within seconds of sharing this with my husband , we both knew we had been drinking this beverage too fast . Brain freeze ! You can drink this much faster than a milkshake . You have been warned . It is tempting and delicious , but may need to be sipped more slowly ... or not.Optional toppings include whipped cream and of course chocolate shavings . Sipping this while wearing Opium perfume is a fun experience . It seems to enhance the experience and add new levels to the chocolate perfection . Oh I think I feel a sugar rush coming on ... My favorite way to drink this:1 . Turn on heating blanket when the weather turns cold.2 . Climb into bed wearing something silky.3 . Sip away while reading poetry.So delicious ! ~The Rebecca Review	1
I really enjoyed my first batch of Kim Chee using Noh of Hawaii Kim Chee Mix . It comes with instructions . I watched some youtube videos of others making Kim Chee which were helpful.I used one Napa Cabbage , half a cucumber ( peeled ) and half a bunch of green onions with one package mix ; soaked for 8 hours at least in brine . I sliced everything into bite sized amounts.Then I rinsed the produce and drained it . I mixed up the mix with water and poured it onto my cut produce . It covered everything with with the sauce.I let it sit and ferment . I like the flavor very much . It is hot and spicy ; just enough to be delightful.I already have a second batch fermenting now.September.24.2011 update : I 've really enjoyed Kim Chee made with the Noh of Hawaii seasoning mix . I 've experimented with adding more produce and now I make larger batches of Kim Chee so that I need to use two packages of Kim Chee for the following:1 Napa Cabbage ( large ) ,1 bunch of green onions1 carrot,1 cucumber.1/2 leek.3 Jalepeno Peppers.Diakon Radish 1/2 lbs.I clean , rinse off everything and slice it up into bite sizes . Then I soak the cut produce in brine . Finally I rinse it three times before mixing in the seasoning mix with fresh water.I like the flavor a lot more with all the above ingredients in it . It is full of flavor with interesting textures and looks .	1
I wanted to try this because the closest place to buy kimchee is 2 cities away ... and way too much trouble ; especially when I can make great kimchee at home . I followed the packet instructions ( using kosher salt for the initial soak ) . Then , after it was rinsed ( 12 hours later ) I drained it very well and layered it ( cabbage , spice mix , cabbage , spice mix ) into a 1 gallon plastic bucket ( available on Amazon ... ..cheap ) . Put the top on and left it on the counter for 24 hours , then in the fridge for 2 days . I DID think it was not quite spicy enough , and needed a little complexity , so I added 2 tsps . of Sambal Terasi ( also on Amazon ) for the depth of the garlic and the shrimp ... ... ... ... .SOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO good ! Crunchy and garlicky and just hot enough . Addictive !	1
With this package , I can easily make Home Made Kim Chee without any complication or ingredients . All you need is vegetables .	1
The best way to make a quick and tasty Kim chi . it 's best when left to marinated in the refrigerator for a few days , but then a Kim Chi to die for ! !	1
For the most part , you wo n't find Noh 's at your neighborhood store . It is the Asian specialty grocery that normally carries it . When you first use this , you say , eureka ! , finally I found what that great flavor is on BBQ spare ribs or roast pork . This little packet has that great Chinese ( really Polynesian or Hawaiian ) red sweet seasoning.A few tips : 1-Do n't let it drip anywhere . Do n't laugh . I have a tough counter and I let a droplet sit for an hour . It was tough to remove it ; this is not only seasoning but food coloring.2-The best use of this is to take left over chicken , pork or beef . Sizzle them up with the mix and a cup of water , covering and turning all pieces . When all of the water in the mix is gone , you have a dish any Chinese restaurant in New York will charge plenty for.3-It 's also good on ribs but you have to experiment to get the exact results you want.4-After tidbits and ribs , the best use is on chicken ; again , you have to experiment with the blend of oven , grill to get the exact balance of baking , char , and Noh's.Overall , a great little secret that brings the restaurant into your home . Just clean up every drop ...	1
These NOH spice packs make Chinese cooking easy . The char siu kit tastes pretty good , too . The Amazon price is too expensive , though . These costs a dollar each at my local grocery store .	1
I have tried many brands of Chinese style BBQ seasoning ... from dry packets to bottle sauces ... and this one is THE BEST ! It looks , smells and tastes like the kind of red and sweet BBQ pork you get in most Chinese restaurants . I have bought and re-ordered these packets from Amazon when my grocery stores quit carrying this brand . They are not as sweet as what you get in a restaurant ... so I add a tiny bit of brown sugar to mine when I marinate ... also works well with chicken . YUMMY = )	1
this was exactly what i was looking forit nailed the flavor exactlyi 'm sure my favorite chinese restaurants use this	1
This is a good alternative to eating oatmeal . I like it better than oatmeal actually and it has the same health benefits . I like the chewy taste .	1
I use to be a potato lover but now i have decided to move onto grains . I tend to be creative in the kitchen but have little time to do so . So if anyone has any suggestions for recipe ideas please share . The packaging was easy to open and the directions where easy to comprehend .	1
good barley that is tasty and healthy for youseems to spew off much less starch as compared to other brands	1
I LOVE BARLEY FOR SOUPS . THIS IS A GOOD PRODUCT . KEEP IN MIND THAT THE SHIPPING WILL BE HIGH UNLESS YOU ORDER MORE PRODUCT TO MAKE THE SHIPPING SENSIBLE TO BUY . I LOVE THIS COMPANY . THEY HAVE EVERY GRAIN YOU COULD POSSIBLY WANT AND MORE YOU NEVER HEARD OF . THANKS	1
very impressed with the quality of this product , i sent some to my father who remembered torrone from his childhood during holidays and he said it was the best he has ever had.i ordered some for myself and this stuff is beyond yummy , each piece is foil wrapped for freshness.i will be ordering more very soon !	1
Bought these especially to include among Christmas gifts for family and friends who remember them from their childhood . The three flavors , lemon , orange and vanilla , will appeal to even the most fussy among us . I , for example , prefer the lemon flavored which is more to my taste as it is less sweet than the vanilla . My son , however , prefers the vanilla because of its sweetness.The candy , which arrived today , Oct. 30 , 2012 , is very fresh . As I removed a candy from its little box , I was able to squeeze it gently in its little silver-colored , inner wrapping and determine its absolute freshness . And , I save some of the little boxes to hold small , USED batteries and drop them off at my recycle center in town so they can dispose of the dead batteries . When I do drop the batteries off , during the Christmas holidays , in those empty candy boxes , I put some of the boxes w/ candies in them in little bags tied with ribbon and a gift tag , and tell the staff at the recycle center these are the ones with candy in them and are Christmas gifts for them . They seem to love receiving them and being recognized for their `` go green '' efforts in recycling.To maintain the absolute freshness of the boxes of candy as I await the holidays , I enclose all in double- or triple- wrapped foil and/or plastic . Of course , I am required to eat one every-so-often to make sure they are staying fresh in those wrappings ! ! Finally , purchasing them through Amazon is such a convenience , and I am delighted to find that I can purchase them , at a reasonable price , just by clicking a few keys on my computer keyboard . Thanks Amazon ! ! !	1
This was a gift for my brother and sister-in-law . Years ago I could get these around Christmas time in our local grocery store , but they have been unavailable for a long time . I was surprised but happy to see them on Amazon .	1
Hands down , this is the best of the Soft Torrone . Enjoying this nougat without fear of breaking your teeth is a definite plus-especially in the cold winter weather . Makes a very nice gift-very appreciated.These individually wrapped pieces in nice little boxes are a special treat . Savor orange , lemon , & vanilla soft nougat . Especially like the portrait of Julio Verne . 20,000 Leagues Under the Sea , anyone ?	1
I give this as a Christmas gift every year , they are great for a small snack and the texture is great .	1
My father is a second generation Italian immigrant and he had torrones since childhood . In his opinion La Florrentine torrones are excellent . I 'll be visiting in a few days and if he has n't eaten them all I 'll try one too . Believe me , if my dad does n't like something he 'll let me know therefore these must be good .	1
As soon and I opened one of these little gems I was transported back to my childhood when I spent my summers with my beloved Nonna.My grandma had a store in Bridgeport Ct . I loved going there , It was one of those stores that had a grocery department in the front and in the back was a butcher , there was saw dust on the floor and fish and hardware splattered around , on the counter my grandma would keep , under the rows of Italian sausage and big balls of aging chees , a basket full of Perugino nougat candy just like this one . Although these are not the same brand the are good enough to bring back fond memories of my times with my grandma.I would come in and call out `` Ciao Nonna '' and she would come and kiss my cheep and grab a couple of candies tell me how much she loved me and tap my bottom and send me on my way with my treat.I just can not stop eating these , they are not exactly like the ones I remember , because it has been a very long time and tastes have changed but these are just as soft and sweet , chewy and still has nice crispy almonds . If the almonds are stale they would be soft and chewy , not good . I love these I am just happy they do not sell them around the corner I would be in trouble.If you have never tried this unbelievable nougat candy you are missing something give them a try you will not be sorry .	1
If you want a taste of England , this tea is the way to go . Great with cream , honey , milk , it is very versatile and mellow . Also great iced .	1
I just purchased this tea because I was looking for a simple , inexpensive , and great tasting black tea . I read the other reviews for PG tips ( which were great ) so I bought some . So the outcome ? It 's excellent . It steeps very quickly and has a nice strong taste . My mother ( at first ) noticed that the teabags did n't have strings and said something to the effect of `` yeah usually if the tea is of cheaper quality it does n't have strings ... '' or something weird like that . Lets just say she quickly got over that and she now makes this tea constantly . Highly recommended for an inexpensive black tea . Lets just say the brits know their tea !	1
Strangely enough , I had never heard of this tea until I saw a mention of it in a novel I read recently . I looked it up and found that it 's one of the most popular teas in England . As a brewed tea lover , I ordered a small box from Amazon . Now I 'm enjoying PG Tips very much , and I 'll probably try the decaf version , since I ca n't drink caffeinated tea at night.The tea is very dark and robust with a pungent aroma , reminding me a bit of Irish Breakfast Tea . I drink my tea straight , but PG Tips is strong enough that I think it should hold up well if sugar and cream were added.I imagine that a specialty import shop may have it , but our local Publix does n't carry PG Tips , so I 'll keep buying it from Amazon . With Amazon 's price and free Prime 2-day shipping , PG Tips is very affordable , especially in the larger boxes.My only minor complaint is that the bag has no string and tab , so I have to fish it out of my Mr. Coffee . The bag would fit in my tea infuser , but it 's easier to just fish it out of the pot .	1
The British know their tea , and this is one of the favorites in England . I 'm not a big tea drinker , but do really like the taste of the PG tips . One of my English friends recommended this one as the only tea he drinks . With a little sugar and a splash of milk , I can sit down and enjoy a proper cup of tea . Love it .	1
I 'm planning on hosting a high tea party in Feb so I started looking around for world teas . This was one of the first a friend recommended as a premier staple in England . Glad I made the purchase . Now I have more shopping to do . I will definitely buy again .	1
I actually bought a small box of this tea just to try it out . I used it for a few weeks and thought `` That was good , but nothing special . '' But after 2 weeks of being back on my old tea , I miss it . So I 'm buying some more . : ) My normal US tea is Newmans Organic or Luzianne , so that 's all I have to compare it to.Note : Each PG bag has about 2 times the weight of tea that 1 bag of a US tea bag has . Or put another way , 2 PG bags equal 1 `` family '' bag of US tea . So while it looks more expensive , in the long run it 's not really . In fact , I can make a full gallon of ice tea with just 8 of these bags . So the price is about the same or better , and the tea tastes better in my opinion .	1
This is the ultimate for anyone who loves a black tea . Rich , not acrid , dry and tangy . I wo n't drink any other tea .	1
This is a wonderfully rich , full flavored tea . It is suitable for every day drinking . This is one of the few teas that can stand up to adding milk . PG Tips is rich , dark , and full of flavor.As an American , once I got used to drinking this fine English blend I can not go back to American blends such as Tetley or Lipton.A fine fine tea , delivered fresh , and quickly .	1
Great taste brews so easy , sometimes I use steva but nt with this tea its great without it.recommend it if you like tea	1
After using Lipton for most of my life , I discovered PG Tips , a staple in most English cupboards . PGT is what real tea is supposed to be . First , it is always fresh , where I 've noticed that grocery store ( USA ) brand are often stale . Besides the flavor , what really sold me on PGT is the strength of the tea . For example , in my ice tea maker , two teaspoons of PGT makes a perfect pot of tea , and I like my ice tea strong enough to stand up against the ice cubes . ( I learned from my grandmother that the best ices tea is hot tea poured over the ice . ) Living in the South , I drink my tea iced 12 months a year , but PGT was made for tea time and is perfect brewed in my grandmother 's vintage tea pot , as well . Add milk and sugar and some & # 34 ; biscuits , & # 34 ; and I feel as if I were living on & # 34 ; the other side of the pond. & # 34 ; PG Tips tea ( loose or t-bags ) is one of the little luxuries in life and Amazon makes it possible for me to enjoy quality and taste . I find that when you factor in the tiny amount of PGT it takes to make my tea ( as opposed to having to use three or four times the amounts of grocery store brands ) PGT is actually less expensive than Lipton . Amazon 's vendor makes it easy to keep PGT in my cupboard . It is always shipped to me within a few days of placing my order . And always fresh.Tip : Try mixing a few PGT with a tropical or fruit flavor tea . Delicious .	1
The product I purchased was excellent , and the service and delivery prompt . However , the item was advertised as `` free shipping '' , yet when I was billed , I was charged what , in my opinion , was an excessive amount for the handling and mailing . The bill further stated that my order did n't qualify for free shipping ( I ca n't remember the reason ; either it was below their minimum or for some other reason ) .Would I purchase again from this vendor ? Yes , but I would clarify the shipping issue before hand .	1
I am very impressed . I saw the reviews and just had to try some , the reviews for this tea are incredible . The teabags do not have tags or strings , which is a bummer , but the taste of the tea makes you forget about that little detail . It just has this strong , smooth flavor , yet not bitter ... This is some of the best tea I 've tried . I want to get it in decaf too so I can drink it in the evening without the caffeine keeping me awake . Highly recommend .	1
Fresh item , packaged well , tastes great , a Nice Strong Black Cup of Tea , just what the wife ordered . I have purchased a few of these , and plan on more in the future .	1
My friends at work tease me because I have an entire desk drawer dedicated to tea . I love my tea . I almost exclusively drink loose leaf tea . I love the taste and the ritual . But sometimes I do n't feel like taking the time to prepare a pot of loose leaf tea , so I `` settle '' for a tea bag.PG Tips really is n't a compromise for me though . I love PG Tips . It 's a great blend of black teas . The taste is great and the bag is convenient.It 's not completely accurate to call this a `` bag '' though , because it 's a pyramid . The water flows through the pyramid very nicely . There 's no string to take it out with though . That 's OK. Use a spoon or let it continue to steep while you drink it.Excellent black tea blend !	1
This is a very drinkable blend of Assam , Ceylon , and Kenyan black teas from PG Tips , one of the UK 's most popular brands . Although some California grocery stores ( and Cost Plus World Market ) stock this tea , I had not tried it until reading helpful reviews on Amazon.Each PG Tips bag weighs 38 percent more than the Lipton bag ( that is available in the USA ) . As expected , PG Tips makes a stronger brew . Each PG Tips bag has so much tea that I can easily make a 12 ounce mug with a single bag . I drink my tea black , but PG Tips is clearly robust enough to maintain character with milk or sweetener.PG Tips is a sturdy , straight-ahead blend with more strength than Lipton 's . It is a caffeine-rich tea - in part because each bag has more tea than other brands.PG Tips uses a pyramid shaped bag that allows more room for tea leaves to expand while steeping . Does it make better tea ? I do n't know , but it is a point of differentiation.PG Tips also sells loose tea . Many tea enthusiasts prefer loose tea . Tea bags contain the less expensive `` fannings '' or `` dust , '' remains from processing loose leaf tea . And with some others brands of tea ( not PG Tips ) , many people can taste the paper used in the bag . However , if you ( like I ) sometimes appreciate the convenience of bags , I recommend trying PG Tips as a sturdy everyday tea .	1

I 'm very particular about my tea and this is my favorite so I 'm delighted to find it on Amazon.com . Living in the back of beyond it is not available in local stores . If you prefer tea bags with string tags hanging from them you probably wo n't like this . Most Americans make tea with hot , not boiling water and then say they do n't like tea . Another reason , in my opinion , why Americans do n't like tea is they were raised on Lipton tea . If you are on the fence about tea try PG Tips with boiling water .	1
I have a British friend , and once she knew I liked to drink tea , she said I had to get the PG Tips ! Now , I could n't find them at any local store when I went shopping . So when I saw these as an add on item , I put in my shopping cart , and waited for my next amazon purchase ( never more than a week goes by , sad to say ) . I got them home , put them in a sealed container , to keep them fresh , and brewed up a cuppa ! Yum !	1
I love black tea and have been trying many different brands . This is my favorite so far . The only thing that could be improved ? Fair trade and I would be a drinker for life !	1
A friend introduced me to this years ago . I liked it and buy it regularly . It 's a standard in my cupboard .	1
A native Brit - I am addicted to my PG tips . So , now that I am living in the US I am committed to buying it online . The tea is full-bodied and so flavorful . I brew it straight in my tea mug by pouring boiling water from my electric kettle straight onto the tea bag and let it steep for about a minute . It is strong enough for me by then and then I add my reduced-fat ( 2 % ) milk to reach a color akin to pale pine flooring . Drink it piping hot and its a fantastic morning pick-me-up . I prefer to buy it in packs of 40 to keep it fresh but the price on the 80s was hard to pass .	1
I and my wife love this tea . PG Tips is not easily obtained in many stores in USA , and I was happy to see on Amazon , and for correct price . This tea is really different . We put mint leaves and a tea bag for two small cups , and we also put honey . It smells great . On a evening , after a hard days work , to smell this hot tea , is relaxing . The taste is really great , we love this tea much better compared to other normal ones we see in stores . They claim that they make this tea from the tips of young leaves , and that really does make a difference . Highly recommended tea .	1
I admit I am a bit of a & # 34 ; tea snob & # 34 ; . This tea was recommend to me and so I tried it . I LOVE LOVE LOVE it . To bad my local grocer does n't carry it and I have to always order it from Amazon but hey.. small & # 34 ; price to pay & # 34 ; for such an amazing tea !	1
I really enjoy this tea . It has a full-bodied flavor but no bitterness or aftertaste . I am fairly picky about my tea and this is exactly what I was hoping to find . I 'm enjoying it and glad that I purchased this brand .	1
Kind of expensive ... .but this is a delicious , unique spread that adds a distinctive flavor to sandwiches . The traditional Branston scenario involves a cheddar cheese sandwich , but I like it on a variety of different combinations . Try it out ... . there is really nothing else like it out there on the market , besides imitators . I wish the price would come down a bit , it ends up being quite expensive per serving , at least here in the USA .	1
This is a delicious tangy/sweet pickle , unavailable in our local stores , and we enjoy it with pork sausages , roast beef , hamburgers and hotdogs . My personal complaint is that I wish it were ground up for easy spreading , so every bottle we receive , I put the contents through the blender , and then back into the original bottle . My husband , who is 86 , and has had dental problems , find the pieces of pickle to large to eat comfortably .	1
I grew up in the UK eating Branston Pickle on all kinds of sandwiches and Ploughman lunches . You just ca n't beat the taste and I would eat more if it was available locally in the supermarkets ... if you have never tried this , I recommend you try it with cheese and try not to finish the whole jar in one go lol !	1
This goes really well with cheese . I ca n't for the life of me figure out why . When you open the jar , you see a sort of dark brown glop which resembles a pickled jam filled with chunks of what look like candied vegetables . And well , that is essentially what it is . The flavor is sweet , but has a huskiness and warmth.I 'm not a big fan of pickled foods , but I like this very much . However , it is not something I eat mass quantities of . I really need to experiment with it some more . I feel it 's one of those condiments that is a bit prone to taking over the flavor of a dish , so depending on your purpose , you might like to use it in smallish amounts . I am glad I have it on hand for when I am in the mood for something to add a little kick of this type to . I usually have this with Irish cheddar on oatcakes . I find that combo to be just about perfect . It is good on sandwiches as well , I think ham in particular.I get the U.K. version ; I 'm told that , like many other products , the U.S. version with the same name is made to a different recipe , which I 'm told is not nearly as good . I have n't tried the U.S. version so I do n't know , but I 'm not inclined to try it .	1
As an American I did n't know quite what to expect , but I like to try different things so decided to give this a try . I 'm hooked . It goes very nicely with chicken and beef . I 've put it in canned beans and it really gave them a very nice kick .	1
-1 star for containing sulphates ; many members of my family are allergic to them.Yatzee always talked about Branston Pickle in his early Zero Punctuation videos . I read that the taste is a blend of Worcestershire sauce & sweet pickle relish ; both things I like on hamburgers & plain burger patties.The description is accurate . I managed to find my first jar at Gourmet 's Gallery in Friday Harbor when I was visiting San Juan Island . I could n't find it at any of the specialty stores back home.I 'll get more creative latter & try it on deviled egg sandwiches & grilled Tuna Melts with white jack/white cheddar/colby-swiss .	1
Branston pickle is not like anything else . It is not pickle relish but a multi-vegetable relish and , yes , it is supposed to be brown . Sweet , not in the least runny and has a bit of a kick . This goes really well with sharp chees and even hot dogs ! Just wish it was less costly .	1
I 've tried a number of liquid and powdered stevias , and this is by far my favorite . My husband stole my bottle after he tried it , because he loves it in his iced tea , and he 's never liked the stevias I 've bought before . The flavors are fun for coffee , but the plain is fantastic for iced tea . It has no carbs , unlike powdered stevias , if you 're a carb counter . I emailed their support and asked.If you get a bitter aftertaste , you 're definitely using too much . Start with a few drops and go from there .	1
I like using liquid stevia in drinks because it is easier to regulate than the powdered form . This brand is priced low , but I find I need to use almost twice as much as the SweetLeaf brand .	1
I purchased several Stevita products and so far I am very pleased . I purchased both this liquid sweetener and another that has a mild strawberry flavor . To be honest , I have n't tried the plain liquid yet but I have tried the strawberry one ( which I am assuming is probably the same thing with added flavor ) .Since I have read over and over people complaining of getting a bitter or weird after taste from stevia products , I decided to add one drop at a time to a 12oz glass of water ; tasting as I went . I stopped at 15 drops ... was a nice subtle strawberry flavor/scent/sweetness with little to no after-taste.Stevia does have an inherant `` bitterness '' to it but this bitterness varies from product to product and can mostly be controlled by the amount used ( although some brands have more of the bitterness than others ) . If you add too much you will get the strong bitter/weird after-taste.If you like a subtle sweetness you will probably like most Stevita products but if you are looking for a sweetener to make things super sweet as in Kool-Aid , grape juice , pop , etc ... this probably is n't the sweetnener for you as the bitter taste will be quite pronounced at that level of sweetness.I bought the flavored sweetener to put in my purse ... so when I go out to eat or grab a bottle of water on-the-go I can quickly and easily add a few drops to the water and have something with flavor instead of plain water all the time ( I am on a low carb diet but plan to maintain a lower carb lifestyle even after I have lost the excess weight ) .When I try the plain liquid sweetener , if I have a different opinion , I will update this review = )	1
I am not a fan of sweeteners but this one is pretty good . It does n't take a lot to sweeten anything which is really good in my opinion . I plan on trying some of the flavored ones and I hope they are just as good . This one also does n't have an after taste like all the other sweeteners on the market and what makes me really hate all the other ones . This one changed my mind about sweeteners .	1
I have the powder form and this liquid form . I love this small 1.35 oz size to carry in my purse . Its easier to add to water bottles than powder packets and not as messy . It 's also great to take along while traveling . Its not overbearing in taste and is pretty sweet to me without a bad after taste .	1
This cream of tartar does everything it is supposed to and arrived very fresh . We use it in baking and also for DIY kids crafts , and it is very effective.Frontier is one of my favorite brands . I buy their bulk cinnamon , cocoa , and other herbs and spices . I have always been pleased with the quality I have received from them . The packaging is always very solid , and the product arrives very fresh and in perfect condition .	1
I use a lot of Cream of Tartar.I make my own baking powder , which requires only a limited amount , but I use it much more for cleaning certain items.I collect vintage cookware . Often aluminum pots , pans , roasters and etc. , have very dark interiors from cooking certain foods.Filling the vessel with water and adding 3 or 4 Tablespoons of Cream of Tartar and boiling the liquid for 20 - 30 minutes ( occasionally longer ) will bring the aluminum back to the bright , silvery color it was when new .	1
Of the higher quality tartar powders , this one is easily available . It consistently performs as expected ( I use it primarily to make my own baking powder ) .	1
It filled a quart jar and it made the most wonderful coconut macaroons ever ! It is a very fine smooth powder .	1
I make my own baking power rather than using store-bought which has aluminum . Ca n't even come close to buying the amounts I need locally . Recommend highly .	1
This is an excellent maple flavor , lots of depth . They flavor tends to linger , which could annoy some . Makes an excellent flavoring for whipped cream .	1
I live in Vermont , smack-dab in the middle of Maple Country . Maple in all forms is standard fare in my kitchen - maple sugar , maple syrup and yes , a little bottle ofFrontier Maple Flavor Alcohol-Free , 2-Ounce Bottlefor those times when I want a boost of maple flavor . Add a teaspoon to your favorite sugar cookie or frosting recipe along with the vanilla for a rich maple flavor . A few drops added to your baked beans would n't go amiss either . ( Be careful - a little of this goes a very long ways . ) You have to be very careful when choosing maple flavoring . Some of it is made out of things you might not expect . Not soFrontier Maple Flavor . Frontier is the premier supplier of spices , flavorings and more to natural food co-ops nationwide . I 've been relying on them for three decades.Frontier Maple Flavorcontains glycerin , water , natural flavors ( contains soy ) , malt extract ( contains barley gluten ) . Those with certain food allergies will want to note the presence of soy and that this is not gluten-free.Grandma 's $ 0.02 - Great maple flavor , reliable product.Highly recommended	1
I bought this maple flavor to make my own low-calorie maple syrup without sugar alcohol or artificial sweeteners , which are commonly found in commercial syrups . I use stevia instead . I 've been very happy with the results . I also add some of this maple flavor to my morning oatmeal , on top of baked sweet potato , and in my homemade butternut-squash soup . The flavor is delicious for all of these uses .	1
This has a great maple flavor and it is strong enough that you do n't have to use a whole lot .	1
I used this to make maple cream candy which I gave away as gifts this past Christmas . My family was raving about it ! They loved the wonderful maple flavor . Not only does it have a wonderful flavor , but I have liked all the Frontier products I have purchased in the past . They are an excellent company and one that I feel I can depend upon for good quality products . This maple flavoring is outstanding , and I will be buying more from them in the future .	1
I decided to try Tellicherry peppercorns after reading a review of the quality of different peppercorns . I really like freshly ground pepper and black pepper in particular . These are what the review said they would be - the best pepper available . From what I have read , Tellicherry peppercorns have been considered the best for a very long time .	1
I 've got a really good pepper grinder and I love to use freshly ground pepper in my dishes . You use less and the flavor 's fantastic . Bought a bag about a year ago and am about to buy my next in Dec. Would recommend to anyone .	1
I use a lot of Black Pepper in my sausage recipes . When I purchase peppercorns in the super market , they cost a small fortune . So these are well worth the price . I have seen Peppercorns that were larger in size but these make up for it in freshness and flavor . If you have one of those empty one quart containers from your Chinese take out ? Save it . You will want to store these in the refrigerator . I toast these in a fry pan lightly before use and it brings these to another level . So they are a great buy .	1
Spicy World Peppercorn ( Whole ) -Black Tellicherry , 16 Oz . bagThis is a very flavorful type of pepper . It is the best I 've had yet !	1
I got into spicing my food with spices intead of fat , salt , and sugar . Tellicherry peppers have changed my life . I used to only know the restaurant pepper shakers . After getting these and grinding pepper myself , I do n't even use the pre-ground stuff . It 's about 10 % of the flavor . These are strong and spice it up right ! So good !	1
I need peppercorns to refill my grinder and was appalled at the prices in the grocery stores . I 'm so glad I found this supplier and will definitely buy from Spicy World again !	1
I think this is a good product , I have just received it but it looks fressh and I like fresh pepper on my pasta , salad etc .	1
This is a very nice pepper . Fresh ground it has a slight fruity smell and flavor along with the peppery bite . I split the bag with my brother . My wife does n't handle spicy food very well and the full bag would have gotten quite old before i would use it all . Next time i 'll look for a smaller bag of peppercorns . Having fun and loving it . Do yourself a favor and try this one .	1
I love home ground pepper much more than the pre-ground stuff most folks use . The taste and aroma of these tellicherry peppercorns is just fabulous . Nothing better than some fried eggs sprinkled with this great home ground pepper . You will not regret buying this product .	1
It does have a good black pepper flavor but I do n't think I would call it very spicy . I use a lot of this stuff in my cooking and for finishing and it works well . Most other peppercorns when I grind them usually makes me sneeze like mad , but I have not had any problems with this one bothering me . Grinds very well !	1
Has a nice sharp pepper flavor that really shows in recipes versus the grocery store stuff . Excellent price .	1
Never thought I 'd be reviewing peppercorn ! Ever ! Heck , I never thought I 'd be reading reviews of peppercorn before I buy it but I must say , not only is this peppercorn EXTREMELY FRESH , it has actually shown me what peppercorn should taste like . Until now , I might as well have not bothered . It was disgusting dust I was crushing all over my food , apparently because the Spicy World Peppercorn iS DELICIOUS - the reviews are not kidding . You get a heart-felt 5 star from me , baby ! Packaging was awesome and it arrived on time too ! Thank you : ) !	1
It 's OK pepper - I do n't think it 's Tellicherry ( and looking at the price I had n't expected it would be ) - it is flavorful and zesty enough , though . And inexpensive - I am a student and price is very important to me . I would buy it again . But if you expect a superior quality product , you will be disappointed !	1
I love this pepper . It tastes so good and I use it basically on everything . I am very happy with this and was pleasantly surprised when I got it . It has a nice bold taste to it that is really enjoyable . I really love this on veggies because let 's be honest veggies are brutally boring . I do force myself to eat a lot of veggies basically to fill my plate and get my stomach full so I do n't eat too much meat . This actually makes them very tasty and I will even go as far to say I rather enjoy vegetables ... . Yup I said it there ya go this pepper gets my seal of approval .	1
These have great flavor and work well in our pepper mills ! You can really tell the difference in the flavor compared to supermarket pepper .	1
Absolutely outstanding pepper , the flavor stands up in all dishes . The pungent pepper smell when I opened the packaging was awesome .	1
Used daily in our kitchen as our primary pepper . Tastes great and has just the right flavor for a good black peper	1
What can I say , it is pepper . It is 100 % black pepper as stated on the package . The pepper is quite flavorful and spicy and I am very happy with the purchase .	1
This is a wonderful pepper corn . Fresh ground it has a great aroma and an even better taste . Squeeze a lemon on a chicken breast and grind these pepper corns on it and saute in your pan till done . This is a truly good spice . Supermarket brands dream to be this good .	1
I always thought peppercorns were peppercorns until I bought these . What an amazing aroma and wonderful pepper flavor . The price is right too . I will be purchasing more .	1
This is great tasting peppercorn and this bag will last you a long long time . I grid it with a hand grinder and use it all the time .	1
This is a great pepper especially for the price . The bag lasted us almost a year . My only comment is that the bag tears somewhat easily so make sure you open it over a bowl and put the open bag in a secondary plastic bag .	1
I love this pepper . The taste is great and you do not have to use as much as regular pepper . People who use ground pepper do not know what they are missing . This is my second order .	1
I love black pepper and Tellicherry is the best . I like the fruity and pungent characteristics of these peppercorns . If you buy already ground black pepper you are missing so much flavor . Grind these peppercorns up fresh and the taste difference is astonishing . These peppercorns are excellent quality and at an excellent price . I will definitely buy this product again !	1
Bought this for my pepper grinder I got myself to Christmas . Love the taste of fresh ground pepper .	1
We 're really enjoying this . It was fresh and strong and grinds very well . Once the bag is cut open , it is flimsy so you either need a large mill , or have a container or bag etc . ready to pour the remaining corns into for storage . No complaints here .	1
Although I prefer the taste ofThe Tao Of Tea Pure Leaf Holy Basil Tea , Tulsi Lavender ( 12x11.5Oz ) , its availability and cost prohibit my drinking it to the extent that I desire.I have now tried theStash Tea Company Organic Lavender Tulsi Herbal Tea , 18 Count Tea Bags in Foil 0.8 oz . ( Pack of 6 ) product , and can definitively say that the Stash Lavender Tulsi tea does not have the 'magical ' taste that I found in the Tao of Tea version -- and given that we 're talking about a tulsi lavender tea that is made with a tea bag , as compared to a bottle of such that was microbrewed , it is perhaps not a surprise that there would be a noticeable difference in the 'quality ' of the taste , and that the microbrewed version would taste so much more 'delicately flavorful ' ( to an extent , it 's almost as though the Stash tea bag version involves a taste that is a taste analogue to the sound of a somewhat 'muffled ' voice , versus the Tao of Tea version , whose corresponding taste analogue would be the sound of one person singing , and whose voice could be 'heard ' 'clearly ' ) .That being said , the Stash tea does have a definite tulsi lavender taste , and adaptogenic effect , and it does result in my relaxing , and beginning to feel a little sleepy -- which is a welcome , though atypical , consequence/effect with my body , given how tenacious aspects of insomnia can be for me.Thus ( and because the taste is 'there ' , though not as 'clearly ' as I would prefer ( but I understand that there is a 'trade-off ' of sorts if/when 'brewing ' via hot water and a tea bag , versus microbrewing the actual leaves ) ) , I will continue to purchase the Stash version ( albeit while silently hoping that the Tao of Tea version ultimately involves less cost insanity at some point , or is otherwise available ( locally ) in more markets , so that ( expensive ) shipping costs ( of the in-a-glass-bottle product ) are not involved ) ) .	1
This is a great decaf green tea . I decided to start drinking green tea due to its purported benefits of prevention of breast cancer , which runs rampant in my family . I have to drink a decaf product , which is unfortunate as some of the beneficial properties of green tea are removed with the caffeine . After some research , I found out that there are several `` natural '' methods of decaffeination and that one involves actually using `` natural '' but not necessarily safe chemicals . Probably the safest method is a process which involves using carbon dioxide . I emailed Stash about this product and within an hour received a very informative , personalized email describing the process they use , which is the CO2 process and the best as not only does it not use chemicals , but the antioxidant properties of green tea are diminished less with this process than others . Since I am drinking green tea solely for the health benefits and not the taste , that is important to me . I think it tastes great for a decaff tea . It is not strong and has a mild slightly bitter taste . I add a little peppermint tea and honey to it and it is super tasty . I am impressed with this tea and company and will continue to order from them .	1
I absolutely love this tea , and it 's a great convenience to have it shipped to me . Sometimes when I went to buy it at the store in the past , they 'd be out of it . It 's just too frustrating to run out of your favorite tea . Having it shipped at regular intervals is great , because I usually know almost done to the day when I 'll need it again .	1
I enjoy this tea daily with lemon . I had been drinking the stash green tea that is n't organic . I may like the non-organic a bit better but it always depends on the batch . I doubt this compares to fine , whole-leaf , carefully brewed tea but I 'm no connoisseur.I put a bag in a travel mug , pour in the hot water , add some reconstituted lemon juice , and I 'm happy . If the tea , or any beverage for that matter , were too good , it would distract me from my work , which I would rather not be doing , but I have to eat and pay the bills .	1
It 's great to drink this organic chamomile tea at night , and this is one of the teas that 's effective for insomnia . Definitely choose organic for Chamomile .	1
This is better than most teas you will find at cafes and restaurants . However , you can buy better albeit at much higher prices . There is very slight bitterness , which some may actually prefer , especially if served with milk and sugar . For those who drink tea straight , this is a good quality medium level green tea . A good stash to have home for a quick tea cup .	1
This tea is excellent ! I like delicate teas just fine , but Stash 's plain Honeybush is pretty bland . The vanilla flavoring in this tea is subtle enough that you may not recognize it as such , but it rounds out and sweetens the flavor of the honeybush to give it a body that tastes like more than just muddled water.I do n't care for most black tea because I find it bitter , and I fancy this my black tea substitute . The flavor is warm , mellow , well-rounded , and has just a suggestion of sweetness and depth to it . Tazo Honeybush is also delicious , but has weird mystery ingredients ( artifical and natural flavor , anyone ? Mmmm ! ) Unlike some of Stash 's teas , this is also perfect iced or at room-temperature , with no filmy crust of flavoring and tea dust to form on top . If you have ever liked a honeybush tea , I am confident you will like this one . The flavor is also similar to rooibos , if you 've tried that , but rooibos has a wider range of flavors it can adopt than honeybush does . Honeybush is always , as its name suggests , just a bit warm and sweet .	1
We so enjoy this tea . Really great taste & we add a little sugar to it . We like sweet tea & this is great .	1
I was worried this was going to taste `` less '' than green coffee , or have some weird after taste or some other sort of nonsense , much like Caffeine Free soda or Diet Soda , etc. , would , but this tastes basically like the regular Stash Green Tea , but decaf ( We buy it for the pregnant ladies at work ) and organic ! This is USEFUL information for those who were afraid to jump the gun on decaf green tea - this particular brand is good !	1
I love my tea in the afternoon . I have always liked Earle Grey teas even though if I drink alot of it , the bergamot oil bothers my stomach . I also like green teas so when I found this one at my local store I thought I would give it a try . It is very pleasant , accommodating my cream and honey very well . I also feel good about getting benefit from both black and green tea . The price is better on Amazon then in my store and subscribe and save makes it easy for me to continually have it on hand . My closest store is sixteen miles away so this service is appreciated .	1
I am drinking two cups of this a day . Tastes good . It would be nice if it came without the string and stapple . I like the automatic shipment then I do not run out unexpectedly . My only point of note , would do not over brew it . I have forgotten about my cup waiting for me and the taste gets a little off when it has sat for an hour ! My bad really , not the teas problem .	1
I drink Green tea most of the day . After 5:00pm or so I switch to camomile tea . It keeps me calm and promotes better sleep at night.I tried several teas and this is one of my favorite taste-wise.Being a Baby Boomer I am more aware of natural ways to stay healthy and enjoy life . I 'm always looking for ways to improve without artificial products.If your nerves get jittery then you want to give this tea a try.Lambert Klein Author ofAnti-Aging for Baby Boomers and Everyone Else Naturally	1
I 've finished drinking 2 of the 6 boxes of Lavender Tulsi Herbal tea . I like this herbal tea as I enjoy the taste of lavender and am glad that the lavender is mixed with another herb as straight lavender can taste quite strong . I 'm not sure I like the flavor of tulsi , but I guess it is n't so bad mixed in with the lavender .	1
I love this tea ! I 'd underestimated that , however , when I subscribed to the Stash organic sampler.Stash Premium Organic Tea Sampler , Variety Pack of Eight Flavors , Tea Bags , 18-Count Boxes ( Pack of 6 ) I ( mistakenly ) figured that I 'd still get enough of this to suit me , but was wrong . Yes , I do enjoy the options , but even so , was too soon out of this one . That 's why I came here to subscribe to it.Many times only this particular tea will satisfy , such as first thing in the morning , or when I want an afternoon lift . I was brought up with the old German custom of `` tea time , '' where black tea was daily served at 4 pm. , and so I 've been a black tea fan for most of my life . That tea was OK ( it was all I knew ) , but this black tea is significantly better ! I 'm attached to the taste , which carries the familiar acidic `` bite '' of black tea , but balances it with the alkaline health effects of green tea . Like some others , I 'd been initially put off by the black/green combo , wondering what to expect . Now , however , I can say to anyone considering it , that if you like Earl Grey tea , then you 'll love this version ! For me , the flavor is best when the tea is piping hot ( and less enjoyable if allowed to cool ) . Consequently , I tend to brew it in an insulated stainless steel mug , which is then topped by a silicone cup lid ( similar to the one at this link ) . [ ... ] Currently I 'm exploring infused tea , being curious about why gourmet tea drinkers will tend to disdain bagged tea . I just may discover flavors unexperienced ! Even so , I doubt this Earl Grey version will lose its high placement on my favorites list . Simply put , it hits the spot . Anyway , teabags are very convenient to use first thing in the morning ! I 've been a long-time fan of Stash ( even before I switched to organic tea only ) , and so I 've welcomed Amazon 's prices . With the addition of the `` subscribe & save '' option , this is an especially good deal .	1
wow amazon you delivered this tea on a Sunday ... love it ... and over the 4th of july weekend at that ... I drink chamomile daily and prefer organic ... .tastes very fresh ... thank you Amazon ... another home run	1
We are major tea drinkers and this Stash Premium Organic Earl Grey tea is wonderful . Great flavor , great price and added benefit of getting antioxidants . A win/win for everyone ! ! ! Highly recommended	1
I drink lots of green tea , and this one is one of the best I 've had . I 've been buying all stash teas in the past few months , including this and the cascade mint and I 'm happy with the quality so far , being organic is a plus because I read horrifying things about toxics in teas .	1
I 'm not usually a green tea fan , but I adore lemon ginger , so when Stash came up with this tea , I sampled it & decided to order in quantity ! Good stuff , & thanks to Amazon for making it available this way .	1
I 've not been a big tea drinker but wanted to be because of all the health benefits . I now drink this tea everyday and it energizes me . I ca n't wait each morning to drink this tea . It has just the right combination of light mint flavor to make it refreshing . The white tea does n't stain the teeth as readily as other teas and it 's very high in antioxidants .	1
this is delicious . I wanted an organic chai , since I found out my other chai did n't do so well when it came to pesticide residues , so I switched to this , and it 's nice I did n't have to give up flavor . This is delicious- spicy , but not overwhelming . And unlike some Chais , I find it balanced . In some only one spice predominates- I find this one to have many flavors .	1
I love Earl Grey tea , and this is the best I 've ever had . An extra kick of the bergamot , I 'm guessing . Or just better bergamot.I first tried this in the Stash Organic Tea Sampler , and it 's easily my favorite in the box , and the first one I run out of.I 'm mostly a green tea drinker these days , but when I want an extra kick of caffeine , this is my tea . Yum !	1
I drink a goodly amount of green tea , so I prefer to get decaf . Ive tried several brands , cheap to higher end , and this one falls in the middlish . I use it almost daily and it 's fine for a basic decaf . I like it iced with a twist of lime.Enjoy ...	1
This is excellent tea.. I 'm glad it 's organic that way I can not only enjoy the taste but the benifits as well.. I was surprised how well this tea taste . I orginally baught for my stomach but I 'm taking a liking to the taste as well . This is now my 2nd favorite Stash tea..	1
I really like Stash teas ; I drink it every day . This particular flavor is very refreshing , a good combination of giner and lemon give it a nice 'zippy ' taste . I like that it is made from organic teas and ingredients , too . That is becoming more and more important to me . I would like to see Stash Tea offer more organic varieties . However , it 's too bad that we have to pay more in order to have fewer artificial chemicals ( herbicides , pesticides and chemical fertilizers ) but that 's the way it is in farming currently . This tea is definitely worth the extra cost .	1
I have insomnia , and this tea , I make in large quantities , and drink all during the day . It really helps my body to relax and dose off easier . The more I 'm using it , almost as a medicine , the more relaxed my body is at night , to help me at least relax more , even though I do n't often sleep well .	1
Stash Organic Premium Green Tea is one of my new favorite green teas . A few months ago I switched from coffee to tea to see if I feel better and I 'm very pleased to discover that I do ! I used to get stomach aches drinking teas , but learned that it is very important to brew teas correctly . Now that I follow the recommendations on the tea packets , I can fully enjoy most teas without issue . This green tea , steeped for no more than three minutes gives a delightful brew , with a cheerful , bright aroma that is easily enjoyed with no sweeteners or milk ( something that I would never have dreamed of in the past ) . My kids described its essence as like that of Fruit Loops cereal , which I think is true . There is not the slightest hint of grassiness or seaweed ; much more like a brisk morning hike through an old growth forest . The liquor is a clear , sunshiny yellow , and it will lighten your heart as you drink it . The only issue I had with it was that getting toward the bottom of the cup , the light astringency begins to concentrate , so I rarely drink the dregs or it can leave me on a sour note .	1
I was looking for a mild flavored tea that I could use to make a lemon tea and this organic chamomile tea is perfect . It does have a lovely aroma but I do n't like drinking it without adding the juice of half a lemon and a packet of stevia . Then I add a little honey . I 'd recommend using two tea bags for one cup or mug.~The Rebecca Review	1
Superb green tea . Organic and decaf . These bags are really filled up , so you get a lot of bang for the bag ! With they came in larger boxes ...	1
helped my 3 month old when she had a stomach ache . I water it down to 4 cups with 1 tea bag for her . Also tastes good for us adults as well .	1
Love Decaf Green Tea , and purchasing on Subscribe and Save at a 15 % discount , is the best price around . I prefer this with honey and cinnamon . I also like it brewed with other teas ( Rooibos and / or Dandelion Root ) .	1
I was looking for an organic green tea that had not been grown in China or Japan . I contacted Stash and was told this tea originated in Japan , but was grown in Brazil . This organic green tea is amazing . My first impression was that it contained a more generous amount of tea than those I had previously made tea with . When I pour boiling water on a tea bag , the green tea blossoms out even without dunking the tea bag . I found the taste to be smooth and not at all bitter . A single bag will easily make a small pot of tea . If you were to seep a single cup for a while , it you might find it a bit strong . This is a notably lovely organic green tea that is grown in Brazil .	1
I have been using Stash teas for years but this is the first organic tea I have tried . The only thing that I can say that is different , other than the fantastic pure taste , is that it takes a little longer to brew it . Which tells me that it is about as natural as you can get ! A 5 star rating is not good enough for this tea , but it is the highest I could give it here . *smile*	1
Stash organic white tea with organic spearmint , organic lemongrass , and organic peppermint has a clean , clear , refreshing mint flavor . It 's my current favorite tea and is a great bedtime drink .	1
I love green tea , so I am always on the lookout for different varieties . I really like this tea . If you let it steep for a while you get a nice taste of the ginger . This is a great tea to start your morning with or for an afternoon drink .	1
I drink loose-leaf tea while I 'm at home , but bags are more convenient when I 'm at work , so I drink this . It 's not the best green tea I 've ever tasted , but it 's inexpensive ( especially via Subscribe & Save ) and has a good brand reputation . If you 're a casual fan of green tea , this will do nicely .	1
Like many regular tea drinkers I prefer the loose-leaf variety when I am at home , but the afternoon cuppa at work calls for something a little less complicated . I am OK with sacrificing flavor for convenience , while saving some pennies at the same time.So far , I have been pleasantly surprised by Stash 's brands of Certified Organic green teas . I have drank both this straight green tea and theStash Premium Organic Earl Grey Black and Green Teacombination . The teas come from the Yamamotoyama Brazilian tea gardens , which were initially planted with Japanese seedlings . The processing methods and standards are all based on Japanese system.The flavor of this Premium Green Tea is really nice , with a subtle grassy flavor that I enjoy in decent green teas . I find that too many American-produced green teas are `` watered down '' in flavor , lacking the oomph that one finds in a true Japanese or Chinese green tea . This cup , however , is close to the real thing . It also gives off a nice green color , which is always a good sign.By no means the best tea you will ever drink , but this Premium Green Tea might just possibly the best inexpensive tea-bag style green tea on the market .	1
This spice blend is amazing . Just add salt and some fresh-ground pepper , and you 're set . Pork is the obvious choice , but it 's also delicious on beef .	1
This is my first five spice , so I do n't have anything to compare it to . But it is the flavor I was expecting and the brand seems to be good quality .	1
... .make this a more mediteranian than chinese 5 spice powder ( which is fine by me ) . 5 spice powder has a slightly woody , musty under taste which this product lacks . Just tried it out in a rice pudding ( along with some frontier ceylonese cinnamon ) and it was excellent.I will use 5 spice a lot more now -which means that this small bottle will last me years instead of decades -a little bit goes a long way .	1
A few quick comments : Purchased from Amazon as an add on item w/free shipping . Still fresh.Frontier is a good brand - the spice is a little sweet ( from the cinnamon ) and a little mild on the heat . A little heavy on the anise and clove , but good . A little goes a long way.Ingredients : CinnamonFennelCloveAniseWhite pepperMy only question - where is the Sichuan Pepper ? I guess since it does n't specifically state `` Chinese Five Spice '' it does n't really need to have the peppers . But you can buy Sichuan powder separately or just add ground habanero or another spicy ground pepper to your dish.Still - could n't find it at my local Whole Foods so I 'm glad Amazon had it for a good price .	1
Bold flavor so you do n't need much , but it definitely gives that Asian twist to the dish . Can be used with anything ; chicken , pork , beef or sea food . Recommended !	1
I bought this to make the Char Siu , or BBQ pork recipe in Eileen Yin-Fe Lo'sThe Chinese Kitchen : Recipes , Techniques , Ingredients , History , And Memories From America 's Leading Authority On Chinese Cooking . Being uninitiated to five-spice powder I thought the mix smelled very weird and unpleasant when I opened the container . But when I mixed it in the marinade as directed , and cooked the pork , it was sublime . The flavor was exactly right -- just like restaurant char siu but without fake dyes .	1
Very useful for Chinese recipes . You do n't need much , so it should last for years . It 's a high quality spice .	1
This is a nice combination of typical spices . It is flavourful and versatile ... I use it in more than just Chinese dishes . I would order again .	1
one of the basic multiflavor spices I keep around at all times ; chinese , mexican , or just about anything , Five Spice and dehydrated Lime are about 100 % useful and flavorful	1
I love spicing up various bland foods like rice , potato dishes , with Five-Spice powder . This is a great , interesting spice that not everyone has been exposed to . Few recipes call for it , other than Asian ones . Unfortunately , I live in a small rural town and can not find this spice in any of the grocery stores . Thanks to Amazon , I not only can purchase it , but it comes at a fair , competitive price . Living where I do , Amazon is the only convenient mall I have , and I am so grateful for it .	1
When I stir fry I like to use a little five spice seasoning . It can be overwhelming if too much is used , , but a little adds a nice flavor to my stir fries.Recommend that anyone should try it , but not too much .	1
Very similar to the one I found in the Asian grocery store I usually shop at . The taste is good , and very good for making broths and noodle soup	1
purchased this pizza spice for my son to use in his off campus apartment to make pizzas from supermarket purchased dough and jarred sauces . his pizzas came out really well and tasty . I love his anchovy pizza with hot peppers . !	1
Pizza is a staple for us and this has become essential . The ground up bits of dried tomato add depth beyond the usual italian spice mix -though Frontier 's other italian spice mix generally gets a shake or two as well.Well worth the small premium over the usual italian spice mixes .	1
The flavors we all miss from pizza shops today . This blend is fresh tasting and is superb ! My local grocery stopped carrying it , I was so happy to find it here . I am addicted , use it as a dry rub when grilling meats and veggies , soups , roasts , garlic bread etc .	1
As another reviewer mentions , this is the flavor missing from today 's pizza joints . It 's like a step back in time , three or four decades , when huge shakers of oregano , crushed red pepper , and grated cheese were on every table ( without customers having to ask for some ) . Using this blend alongside & # 34 ; Go Veggie & # 34 ; Parmesan flavored sprinkle is fabulous.We are dairy free , cook 98 % of meals at home , and do n't have a salt shaker in the house ( do n't care for the stuff ) . We LOVE and use plenty of spices , and have been sure to keep this blend on hand ever since we first tried it two years ago . Goes on our marinara sauce , soups , and tomato-based vegetable stew . Also good when reheating leftovers ; it gives a slight change to the flavor when heated into the food instead of just sprinkling on top .	1
The Mix is exactly Right in one container.Use in INSTANT LUNCHES that contain TOMATO.Make HEALTHY homemade DIP or sauce .	1
I 've purchased this salt free herb seasoning several times now -- -- really helpful in adding alot of flavor to a dish , especially if cooking without meat added to the dish .	1
best spice purchase in awhile i must say . great fresh nutmeg flavor . u have NEVER had real nutmeg flavor until u grate this stuff in ur soups or cakes , or breads . good stuff . great stuff .	1
Not really a ton & # 8211 ; but this 1.8 ounce jar of nutmegs will last me for the remainder of the year & # 8211 ; literally ! No complaints , though .	1
This is my first whole nutmeg purchase and I wo n't be trying any others . They really grate up nicely with such a heavenly aroma . I grate this nutmeg over everything . Baked sweet potatoes , oatmeal , baking , macaroni and cheese , lattes . Mmmm ! I will never go back to the dried pre-ground version ! I thought the price was more than fair and I love that it is organic .	1
I love this nutmeg - it even has a nutmeggy scent before cracking the nut . Very fresh and sweet . YUM !	1
This is way better than ground nutmeg . I am not a big fan of the ground stuff but this is just wonderful in recipes . I made zucchini bread and put a little more of this than I had anticipated in my recipe and it was heavenly . Now I love nutmeg in so many desserts and drinks . Hot cocoa for one .	1
Nutmeg is rich in protective anti-inflammatory compounds that can lower your risk of cancer by stifling tumor growth . Macelignan the compound in nutmeg fights the germs which reduces plaque formation by 50 percent and eradicates cavity-producing microbes . This is not saffron . Saffron is very , very expensive and comes from Iran . Nutmeg is from Malaysia and Indonesia . For purity place some in water . If water turns into a murky color then it is diluted since real nutmeg will turn water yellow . In small quantities nutmeg is safe , but in higher quantities , nutmeg is very poisonous and toxic . Nutmeg has been used as a drug in other countries and indulgence can cause a slew of adverse effects . I use it in moderation and try to get the whole nut and grind it myself . In my big dishes , I just throw in the nut , no grinding . Nutmeg has a very strong and distinctive taste.Spice Hunter is sold everywhere so prices varies considerably . This is a good brand in organic form . Powders always lose the taste and smell sooner than the whole nut regardless of the food item but grinding may be a challenge for such a hard nut .	1
nothing like the fresh taste and smell of grated nutmeg and this organic nutmeg is great wow wow wow wow	1
I was afraid this might be too spicy , but it 's not . I just started using this a couple days ago and have added it to BBQ chicken I made in the crockpot .	1
Once you taste this one , you will find soooo many things to season ... I use it a lot ... love it especially in lentils ! I do n't eat red meat but I think this would be excellent ... it 's a bit too heavy on fish IMO .	1
Will help add delicousness to whatever you are putting on especially if you like to make things taste full flavored .	1
Really like this as I love the flavors of garlic , onion , and it is a quick option when I do n't want to chop up spices .	1
I got some at the World Market before they went out of business and searched a lot of stores as I painstakingly used it sparingly for years thinking I would never find it again . I have and this is my third jar . It is terrific and not so citrusy as the copy cats . Spruces up everything from hamburger helpers to eggs . I use it on steak & hamburgers along with some salt based seasoning to increase the flavor and not the salt . It is the best spice for fish ever !	1
I took a chance to try this as a good purpose seasoning and for my many rice dishes . Pleasant surprise with great flavor . Good price , especially putting on subscribe and save .	1
It 's interesting when you find out that tapioca pearls are actually those little bubbly round things you find in pudding . They are REALLY good . This is a great product . I recommend it .	1
I got a different brand than pictured , but they were intact for the most part , the bag was the same 2.2 lb size , and prepared wonderful chewy pearls ! I just drop them in water at a rolling boil , stir them constantly for about 3-5 minutes , then turn the heat to minimum , cover , and simmer for 45 minutes . Then drain , rinse , and soak in a little sugar syrup , honey , and ground ginger while you make your tea or smoothie .	1
If you follow the instructions on cooking boba/tapioca/bubble tea , the consistency and taste is amazing . The only downside is that the pearls tend to crumble in the bag and are generally fragile before they begin to cook and darken . Also , if the water is not hot enough in the beginning , you get the same problem of the pearls dissolving and things getting a bit messy and/or sticky . If you are patient and dedicated , these are the best choice , but if you want a simpler alternative , try the black minute pearls instead . Less delicate , easy to make , and just as tasty in the end , they are a lovely alternative . It 's your choice , though . Either way , boba/tapioca pearls are a deliciously addictive addition to most iced drinks , especially milk teas , but also quite a few juices .	1
Fun candy that made a fun gift for my Dad . It was well put together with novelty candies and he enjoyed the gift .	1
I purchased this for $ 7.40 for my husband and had it shipped to his office . The candy was a big hit with he and his coworkers ! That being said , I would never pay full price ( $ 28 ) as there 's not a whole lot in the box . If you can grab this when it 's & lt ; $ 10 and get free shipping I say go for it ! : )	1
well , people complained about the candies but I actually find them very delicious , I do n't really think they are made like back in the 60 's or I hope they are not lol . I tried them all and they seem fresh so I am giving them 5 stars , plus the box is pretty neat .	1
This is an amazing nostalgic trip to the candy store of years past . The box contains a dizzying array of candy that was popular in the 1960s . Many of these candies have been rarely to never seen in the years since . Some ca n't pass contemporary political muster ( candy cigarettes or licorice pipes , anyone ? ) and some were novelties even at the time ( wax lips , for instance ) and do n't taste any better now than they did then . Sadly many of the candies are now made overseas ( the candy cigarettes were made , much to my surprise , in Macedonia ) , but they do look and taste authentic and are packaged nicely in a sturdy box with a bow on it.One of my favorites in the box is the `` Big Hunk '' candy bar which I remember dimly at best . Although the directions for preparing and eating the `` Big Hunk '' on the back are certainly modern ( and involve either flinging your `` Big Hunk '' as hard as you can or microwaving it ) , they are very funny nonetheless . I really love the `` Lemon Heads '' and `` Cherry Heads '' and I do n't think I had seen cinnamon toothpicks for decades , but the real treat in the box for me was the little bag of `` Gold Mine Gum '' which is still as cool ( and tasty ) as it was years ago.This is an expensive box of candy , and is probably not something you would buy every day . Having said that , you get about two and a half pounds of great retro candy presented nicely in a box for your money . I highly recommend this to anyone who misses the strange and wonderful candies of the 1960s .	1
I like most of the candy . I remembered most of it , which much of the candy was still going strong in the early seventies when I was a kid . It brought soothing memories a long with eating the candy of my youth . However I found one item that could be harmful if a child got their hands on it . A very non candy toothpicks . This is why I gave it one less star .	1
Took me a bit , but I 'm a convert after running out and going back to normal tea . Was n't obvious at first but became apparent the day I had to switch `` cold-turkey . `` Great flavor , enough caffeine , and no need to add anything . Will be buying more.vs PGtips and Yorkshire Gold.________________ ( + ) Less astringent ( + ) Does *not* get bitter with long steeps . ( +/- ) Caffeine is same as Yorkshire/PG tips ( + ) Beats yorkshire Gold in flavor ( difficult to tell differences if you take sugar/milk/lemon/etc . )	1
If you 're a tea drinker these are some of the best tea bags I 've ever had . My grandmother a tea drinker for 60+ years turned me onto them and I really enjoy them . They are very strong brews and is not watered down after adding cream/sugar .	1
I actually first learned about Barry 's tea in a novel I was reading . It piqued my interest enough to try it , but it was n't available at our local supermarkets , so I ordered a box from Amazon . I 'm very pleased with the tea , it 's a very robust but smooth , full-bodied black tea that I love to drink straight or with a few drops of lemon juice . I brew a couple of cups a day in a Mr. Coffee machine that I use only for tea , and it makes a great hot drink .	1
My poor husband ca n't find a decent tea 'in the States ' . Our local grocery stopped importing from Ireland some time ago . My Mom bought Barry 's as part of a gift basket for him and he 's never looked back . I can only hope that there is enough in stock to keep him happy !	1
Since its founding in Cork , Ireland , in 1901 Barry & # 8217 ; s Tea has been known for its excellence . Indeed , Barry & # 8217 ; s Tea now accounts for 34 % of all tea sales in Ireland . This wonderful tea is a blend of mainly African teas with some Indian teas . It has a nice golden-brown color and a crisp aroma . But , the best thing about it is its taste ! This is an excellent black tea , one which I enjoy every chance I get . Also , it not only tastes great hot , but it makes an excellent iced tea . So , if you are looking for a tea that tastes great hot and cold , then get Barry & # 8217 ; s Tea & # 8217 ; s Gold Blend . I highly recommend it .	1
One of the little splurges in our house is good quality tea and of the ones we truly 'must have ' in our breakfast rotation of teas is Barry 's . It is good all the time but on a snowy cold morning nothing fits the bill like the rich dark liquor this makes steaming away in a mug . Great blend !	1
I have long been a fan of Yorkshire Gold & PG Tips & Typhoo et al . For some reason I never thought anything could be better than the aforementioned blends . I saw Barrys Gold Blend on the shelf of my supermarket and from the first cup it is now my absolute favorite . It is malty , hearty , slightly fruity , assertive , strong and very very tasty . With milk or cream , sweetener or not , you will become spoiled by this drink . Try it and enjoy your new favorite black/breakfast/Irish tea.PS : Barrys Breakfast Blend is slightly less bold ( aka : not as strong/smoother ) and marketed as `` Good for Any Time Of Day '' . Barrys Breakfast Blend is very good but Barrys Gold Blend is never too over the top for my palate .	1
Having never heard of Barry 's tea and learning it 's an Irish tea , I decided to check it out with a friend who has visited his wife 's aunts and uncles and cousins in Ireland very , very often . Had he ever had Barry 's tea ? Indeed , he had . Every day , in fact , that he 'd spent in Ireland . And was the tea good ? Indeed , it was . He always had some on hand back here in the states.And then he told me that he liked tea strong with nothing added . One of his wife 's aunts did n't approve . She gave him his cuppa and then offered him sugar and milk . When he declined , she exclaimed , `` No milk ! No sugar ! Never heard of such a thing . Why , it 's not Ash Wednesday , Lent , or Good Friday . `` I plan to buy Barry 's when I find some shelf space to store it . And , I will drink it with milk and sugar if it 's not Ash Wednesday , Lent , or Good Friday.Amazon , your reviewers are a hoot .	1
This truly is the best `` real tea '' -- just a golden cup of pure flavor -- and a pretty color it is ! You must try it to know -- -- I was introduced to it at an Irish festival in Pittsburgh , PA about 12 years ago ! !	1
I usually buy the Barry 's Breakfast Tea , which I think is spectacular . This time , I tried the Barry 's Gold tea ( the red box ) . It does n't disappoint . It 's the same flavored tea , just with `` something more '' in it 's richness . You do n't get the sense that you are drinking it to `` wake up '' , but to relax , anytime of day , with a great cup of tea.I do n't know what they blend this stuff with , but one of these teas that they blended in must be geared toward relaxation . It does n't `` take the edge off '' as Green Tea does , but it comes pretty darned close . Perfect for people who want to a comforting cup of tea , but do n't like herbal or green teas . It 's caffeinated , that 's the only difference.I 'd call it close to perfection . I like it better than the green box , actually .	1
I have ordered Barry 's Irish Tea bags in the green box before and loved them , so I decided to try the Barry 's Gold Blend tea bags in the red box . These are just as good ! I love good full bodied tea . My mother was from england and our family has always enjoyed a good cup of hot tea with milk . Not just any tea , mind you ! It has to be a very strong bodied , tea . Barry 's is excellent and I appreciate it that Amazon.com carries this tea and at an affordable price too ! : )	1
I thought these tasted very good ( but I am not a cheese puff expert ) , others thought these were just OK - definitely snackable and will be devoured , but they would prefer another brand .	1
These cheese balls are the best and the only ones you can get pretty much since Planters stopped making them . But they have this same container at WalMart for $ 5 .	1
Utz Cheese Balls with Real Cheese Snack , 35 Oz are a good buy , we bought 2 at the sale price . They were cheaper than even the big box store price . This is a good deal , better than buying the name brand cheese puff snack and taste good and were crunchy and not stale . A good buy especially with Prime free shipping . I would buy from here every time at this price and this snack is a hit around the house .	1
This has been used for decades and was affectionately called `` Hippy Sauce '' . Now it is a healthy staple for health food lovers by adding essential amino acids and protein to an already healthy diet of salads , veggies , soups , chinese food , meats , fish , etc . Gluten free . No preservatives whatsoever . This is a great alternative to soy sauce and other preservative filled sauces . Highly recommend this product for a healthy lifestyle . Delicious , kids will love it also .	1
Due to high blood pressure I try to avoid salt , but miss the flavoring enhancement . Bragg 's gives a low sodium substiture with wonderful taste . The spray bottle is very convenient and helps control amount used . I even use it on salad greens instead of traditional salad dressing .	1
Bought this because we have to watch the sodium . This tastes EXACTLY like soy sauce , but with a fraction of the sodium and it 's better for you . We actually use instead of salt on about anything ! I had this in a bottle with a & # 34 ; drip & # 34 ; top ... the spray top is REALLY awesome cause it mists all over . Would I recommend this ? TOTALLY .	1
This is a great substituent for soy sauce . I might not be a soy aficionado because I ca n't tell the difference . I do n't feel any guilt using as much as I want	1
I love this product ! The flavor is very similar to soy sauce , but I 'd venture to say it actually tastes better . Aminos are very healthy for you and do n't have all the sodium of soy sauce . This bottle is my preferred packaging since you can squirt your food and use even less . I use it on rice , vegetables , or any other dish that just needs a little kick .	1
This stuff is greAt , bought after getting a air popper popcorn machine . We spray it on every time and it 's so yummy , we then refill from a large bottle of Braggs .	1
I had never tried this product before nor heard of it until I came across a vegan recipe I wanted to make . A small amount adds a lot of flavor . The first time my husband and I tasted it , we were impressed . It is better than soy sauce . Has an all natural mild taste loaded with flavor , but not too salty . Would be excellent on vegetables , soup or brown rice . Liquid Aminos also contains 16 essential and non-essential amino acids . I had a hard time finding this product in a regular grocery store . I was delighted Amazon carried it . I will never go back to soy sauce .	1
I had n't sprouted in over 30 years ! It was fun to come back to it . The sprouts are so delicious - I do n't know if it 's because they are fresher than those in the store or maybe just taste better because of the experience of sprouting them myself ! I 'll definitely buy these again . But I wo n't need to very soon - it only takes a tiny bit to make a whole jar and the jar full of sprouts lasts a full week and still look and taste fresh !	1
I got some alfalfa seeds from other sources and they did n't sprout very well . It seemed like maybe 4 out of 10 seeds sprouted so I ended up with a bunch of seeds with a few stingey sprouts mixed in . This Handy Pantry seeds i was very happy with . Every seed sprouts into healthy crispy sprouts .	1
If you 've never grown your own sprouts , you 're missing something wonderful . Takes a few days , but the taste is incomparable and they 're always fresh . Note that you do n't need any fancy sprouting equipment ; you can do just as well with a jar , some cheesecloth , and a rubber band .	1
These are So delicious and I do n't have to worry about pesticides or `` cooties '' from store sprouts.I 've already grown 1 batch in a mason jar and 2 batches - in a Pasta Express macaroni cooker . I know it sounds weird but the Pasta Express is a great sprouter ! It 's the middle of a loooooong winter in Upstate New York . These are a fresh , easy , nutritious joy .	1
These seeds consistently sprout , and without any mold . Great ! I would continue to buy them . Also , nicely packaged in a resealable heavy-weight plastic .	1
Sprouted very well with few culls . Taste is what one expects from sprouts of this type . A good seed for those who are just getting into sprouting . My husband likes them & he 's a meat and potatoes guy ! Recommend them highly .	1
I 've been sprouting since I received them in the mail . They take about 4 days to sprout . They are great on salads and sandwiches .	1
If you love broccoli as much as I do , or just want to be healthy , buy this !	1
Excellent deal on clean seeds with a high germination rate . I use the & # 34 ; Easy Sprouter & # 34 ; with excellent results and minimum effort .	1
I 'm not a fanatic ( yet ) , but I buy organic whenever I can . These seeds sprout readily and take only a few days to grow to tasty green sprouts . Amazing how much more vitamins there are in sprouts than in the finished vegetable or grain . We eat those too , of course , but on sandwiches , these really taste good . Most of the time , price is a reflection of quality and I was concerned that these would not be as good as the others that cost a lot more . Well , I had no cause to worry , these are terrific ! There is no need to pay double for good organic sprouting seeds . I have tried every sprouting system on the market , and have found the Easy SprouterSproutamo - Easy Sprout Sprouterthe fastest and , yes , easiest to use .	1
I sprout my own seeds , you ca n't buy sprouts in Washington state any more . Todd 's seeds are high quality and they all sprout perfectly . A pound seems like a lot but when I am not paying $ 10 for a small package I have not had to skimp on serving size and even let my husband have some . This is my second pound this year . Fresh sprouts are a nutritional powerhouse and yummy too . I eat them for the anti cancer effect .	1
Yeah probably it 's organic and obviously very so healthy for anyone .	1
Glad to find this source for organic seeds . Shipping was so quick . I am impressed with the quality of seeds I 've purchased for sprouting , and am thinking that I will return to purchase seeds for my garden . Organic is very important to me . I bought tomato starts from a local nursery last year , and produced tomatoes that NEVER spoiled . So sure I got into some GMO plants , and I want to avoid that at all costs this year !	1
at first i had some issues getting them to sprout but they finally did and after 6-7 days i had abundant sprouts and they are great mixed with alfalfa but i dont like them straight they must be mixed for my taste these are so healthy and cheap compared to buying lettuce with pesticides and gmo crap sprouting is the wave of the future and i wish i knew about this 20 years ago	1
These work great for sprouting , but be warned , broccoli sprouts are a little smelly ! : - ) But what is a little sulphur smell when we are doing something so good for our health ?	1
I love the flavor . I had some trouble with germination and rot , so I contacted this seller . They recommended the Easy Sprout Sprouter and I have n't had a bit of trouble since . I can sprout a half cup of seeds at a time with virtually no waste .	1
Sprouts are the future . I predict as people start raising more of their own food their popularity will grow exponentially . DD	1
I am really happy with the sprouting seed mix I received from the sprout house . The seed is very fresh . I had near 100 % germination , and this blend ; brocoli , radish clover , is really nice . The radish gives it a little bit of tang , the broccoli a bit more body . The fresh sprouts are so much better than what you get in the market ! We have been eating them out of the jar . ( I have mine sprouting in a jar , with a sprouting lid : Sprouting Strainer Lid This is an economical way to try sprouting , if you do n't already have a sprouter . For those who do , I will just recommend this blend . The flavors , size , germination time compliment each other & work nicely together . It is also a very good value . Broccoli seed & sprouts are generally more expensive . I like that this seller is honest and not representing this as broccli sprout ( disguising the blend ) or overcharging for it . For those who generally buy sprouts and are considering growing them : I started with the recommended 2 tablespoons . This filled a quart jar in a few days , producing about what you get in a 4 oz bag at the supermarket . Here ( in Hawaii ) that bag costs around $ 3 . I do not know exactly how many tablespoons you get from a pound of seed , but judging by what I have used , I am guessing at least 40 . That means that buying this many sprouts at the market would have cost me at least $ 60 , and would not have been as fresh , nutricious , crisp or flavorful.So far none of ours has made it to the fridge , and I am going to try to keep it that way . ( they start losing sugars , nutrician and flavor as soon as you refrigerate ) . Given that this is the first batch we may well get through them without putting them away . I think for the next batch i will just sprout 1 tablespoon , and if I want mo9re , start another batch a couple of days later . I really want to have them fresh and not out of the refrigerator ( that is why I am sprouting to begin with ) .It is very humdid here , so to keep them fresh I am going to pack in a jar with some silica gel packs . keeping the seed in the refigerator might not be a bad idea ( though it is humid in there too and may reduce germinhation ) . the freezer ; not such a good idea . i suspect that would severely reduce germination , if not kill the seed ( depending on the temp of your freezer ) . Seed keeps well if it is dry & out of direct light.the instructions provided are good enough to get a novice going in no time ( and honestly , you can grow them with just a jar , cheesecloth and a rubber band ) . sprouting is really easy , and the sprout house makes it all the more so . I wrote this review when I came back to see who I had gotten the seed from , as I want to see what else they have ; a happy customer coming back for more.I am appending my review to note that I bought my seed from the sprout house , fulfilled by Amazon and can not attest to either the price or quality of seed sold by other marketplace seelers . That does n't mean it is not good seed or a good price , just not what I purchased or reviewed .	1
Hmm . I thought I already did a review on this , but I guess I didn't.I 'm very much the novice at sprouting so this is the first one I 've tried and I really like the combination.It has the right sweet/hot spicy kick to it and I find myself putting it on almost everything.I sprout using filtered , ionized water and have had great success , I think , so no complaints there as I think using tap water , which even plants and animals do n't want , surely would n't do well for sprouts . Just my opinion.Happy .	1
The seeds came in a plastic bag with a baggie tie . About 85 % of the seeds germinated . This mix is a bit spicy if eaten alone . However , it tastes great when eaten with other vegetables or in a sandwich . I top my salads with these sprouts.I used 2 - 3 tablespoons of this seed mixture to sprout in the Easy Sprouter . My house is coolish in the winter ( 55F - 65F ) so I put the Easy Sprouter in the oven which is a bit warmer than the rest of the house . If you need to make it even warmer , turn on the oven light to add a bit more heat ! NEVER turn on the oven itself as that would cook the seeds and melt your Easy Sprouter ! Here are my sprouting steps for my sprouter:1 . Since there are small alfalfa seeds in this mix , put in the small-slit insert to the inner slit cup to prevent these seeds from washing out . Put the inner cut into the outer cup . Soak 2 - 3 tablespoons of seed in the sprouter for 12 hours . Put on the slit dome cap to allow aeration . Put the sprouter in the oven for a warmer environment if needed . Otherwise , leave it on the kitchen counter . ( You do not need light for sprouting. ) 2 . Pull out the inner cup ( with the slits ) to drain out the water . Turn on the faucet to give the seeds a `` shower '' and allow the water to drain out completely . Shake the inner cup and tap it against the sides of the sink to drain out all water . Put the inner cup back into the outer cup ( solid cup without slits ) . Put back on the slit dome and put the sprouter back into the oven.3 . Repeat # 2 every 12 hours for about 4 days . It 's necessary to give your sprouts showers to wash off any potential mold and to maintain moisture around the seeds.4 . To store your sprouts , just take off the dome lid and put on the vented lid . It 'll keep for about a week or so.For videos and recipes , check out SproutPeople .	1
My first batch of these seeds is currently in the sprouter . It appears most , if not all , of the seeds have sprouted in about four days . This is my first attempt at growing sprouts . If all blends are this easy , this wo n't be the first batch ! Excellent seller communication . Would buy again . I do wish they came in a resealable bag like other brands . Not a huge deal . I just put them in a jar and stored them in the pantry .	1
These are good sprouts , and this bag will probably last me a year . I keep them in the freezer .	1
Not only are the seeds great , but the customer service is the best I 've experienced in my over 10 years of on line shopping.In my opinion 5 stars are not enough !	1
The seeds came in a plastic bag with a baggie tie . About 90 % of the seeds germinated . This mix is a bit spicy if eaten alone . However , it tastes great when eaten with other vegetables or in a sandwich . One of my new favorite ways to eat these sprouts is add a spoonful of hummus to the sprouts . It adds flavor and cuts the spiciness of the sprouts . Give it a try ! I top my salads with these sprouts as well.I used 3 tablespoons of this seed mixture to sprout in the Easy Sprout . My house is coolish in the winter ( 55F - 65F ) so I put the Easy Sprouter in the oven which is a bit warmer than the rest of the house . If you need to make it even warmer , turn on the oven light to add a bit more heat ! NEVER turn on the oven itself as that would cook the seeds and melt your Easy Sprouter ! Here are my sprouting steps for my sprouter:1 . Since there are small alfalfa seeds in this mix , put in the small-slit insert to the inner slit cup to prevent these seeds from washing out .

Put back on the slit dome and put the sprouter back into the oven.3 . Repeat # 2 every 12 hours for about 4-5 days . It 's necessary to give your sprouts showers to wash off any potential mold and to maintain moisture around the seeds.5 . On the last day , you can also put your sprouter near in indirect light to get some greening of the leaves . It 's not necessary but it sure is pretty to see the little green leaves on the sprouts.6 . To store your sprouts , just take off the dome lid and put on the vented lid . It 'll keep for about a week or so.For videos and recipes , check out SproutPeople .	1
Broccoli sprouts are expensive , but mix well with alfalfa , radish , and clover to lower the cost , and retain nutrition/health.. Organic , 100 % germination , reasonable cost , and ( best of all ) great tasting= a good value .	1
Tasty mix of sprouts . Easy to grow . I keep them in the freezer and expect this bag to last a very long time .	1
I bought these sprouting seeds a year ago . They are still making good sprouts despite being in storage for eight months . These sprouts taste great and are a great investment in you and your families health .	1
These seeds grow perfectly in my easy sprouter . 1/4 cup of seeds in 5 days . make 2 full cups without fluffing . They give me energy but I do n't like radishes and the radishes overwhelm the more suttle flavors . I would like it without the radish or with just a touch of radish . This is the perfect food for someone who loves radishes . I tried them in salads , stews , spaghetti sauce , great in eggs and on pimento cheese sandwiches even with the radish taste .	1
L & auml ; kerol licorice pastilles from Sweden are a firm but chewy little button with a strong traditional licorice flavor . The ones in the red box have a distinct menthol taste , which seems to go really well with the taste of licorice . Flavored with xylitol , they are almost calorie free at just 3 calories per pastille . Moreover , they are not just great for flavor . This itself would be enough of a reason to pop one in your mouth from time to time . But they are also good for the throat . Licorice is soothing to the respiratory system . ( Many traditional European cough syrups have a licorice base . ) And L & auml ; kerol , with its strong dose of licorice extract , is no exception . They also are good for the breath . A couple of these pastille last a long time in the mouth and provide the licorice lover with a long-lasting licorice taste .	1
This is my favorite Lakerol . A strong flavor of Licorice and Menthol , with very little sugar . Nice texture . A nice vice without the consequences ; - )	1
Update on 09-03-2010 : I recently learned ( by reading ) that the natural sweetener Xylitol is poisonous for dogs to ingest. -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -Too bad I ca n't rate this product with ten stars ! Manufactured in Sweden , these are appreciated around the world . Why do I appreciate them so much ? What are they like ? Well , here goes : Sugar free with only 3 calories per serving , they are sweetened with xylitol , which occurs naturally in the fiber of many fruits and vegetables . Xylitol has virtually no aftertaste , and does n't impact blood sugar , so diabetics can enjoy them . With these , I have n't noticed any tummy discomfort as I do with Sorbitol or Aspartame . I do n't really consider these as candy in the normal sense , but more as a refreshment . These pastilles are a wonderful treat that can help prevent cavities by keeping the saliva flowing . This is especially helpful for those of us who are stressed , have a medical condition or take medications that can cause dry mouth . These pastilles are firm but chewy , and also melt in one 's mouth . There are no sharp edges which can occur with some hard candies.The taste is distinctive , rich and pleasurable , with notes of licorice and menthol . A serving is two pieces , with a total of 12 servings per box ( which is small enough to discreetly carry in a pocket or purse . ) Lakerol Special Licorice pastilles come in handy , too . Ever need to change the subject in a hurry ? Offer one of these . Got the munchies at 2:00 a.m. but want to wake up free of guilt ? Forget the cake and have a couple of these instead ! Mouth going dry on your way to the principal 's office ? ( Or enrolled in a speech class ? ) No problem . These will help ! Bored stiff trying to do your taxes ? Lakerol and a stroll away from your desk will help refresh you ... and with luck you will think of a couple more deductions.If you suffer from arthritis or any other source of chronic pain as I do ( ankylosing spondylitis ) , these may help distract you from the pain and help you proactively focus on doing something kind and positive for yourself , such as gentle stretching or a hot bath.These do have menthol , but are not overwhelmingly strong , which is a nice plus . If you have a sensitive mouth , as I do , this can be very comforting . Also , I 'm a chocoholic , but more often than not these stop those cravings and reframe my feelings to something more positive.My husband and I both love these and would n't want to be without them . Whoever invented them must be a genius ! I 've ordered them multiple times through Amazon.com and am extremely satisfied . My order often arrives within four days or so . What more could I ask for ? I hope you try these if you have n't before ... . they really are special .	1
I was surfing Amazon for sugar free items and found these . I love licorice and I also love menthol so I decided to try these never having had any . I was very happy that I did . They freshen and waken your mouth delightfully . I hope other flavors are forthcoming !	1
I use this in my morning Mocha and it is very nice . It adds a richness of flavor . Very little is needed and it should last a long time . A nice change from liquid vanilla without the alcohol .	1
This vanilla powder is intense and extremely concentrated . It appears it will store very well as opposed to liquid vanilla . I am glad I purchased it and am well pleased .	1
I use this and stevia , and sometimes fruit , in plain yogurt , and it 's great . Sometimes I make cream sodas with it using seltzer water and stevia , a nice treat . I still use other gluten-free vanilla extract for some things , but this is perfect when I do n't want any alcohol taste .	1
If you 're looking for a powder substitute for pure vanilla extract , look no further ! The first ingredient is natural vanilla bean extractives , then evaporated cane juice , silica , and cellulose . It has a wonderfully rich smell and taste that will enhance your baked goods . Just substitute 1/4 tsp powder for each tsp of vanilla extract . Very glad to have found this !	1
Very tasty , worked perfectly in a cookie recipe and two different muffin batches . It didnt even occur to me at first that I needed a vanilla extract substitute , but when it did , I 'm glad I found this . Will definitely buy again .	1
Easy to use and very nice vanilla flavor . Love the aroma . The aroma and flavor do n't evaporate with the alcohol which is in the liquid vanillas .	1
This stuff tastes great and dissolves easily . it can be sprinkled on cereal or in tea . It has a nice subtle vanilla flavor and aroma . You can also use it for baking . I like it better than the liquid stuff , which is often mixed with alcohol , this is more pure .	1
Love this product . I can sprinkle it in any baking the requires vanilla . Smells delicious !	1
This is a great latte topping . Has a good vanilla flavor . I will also use it to sprinkle on cookies and French toast .	1
I ordered this because my husband is from Pennsylvania , which seems like to only place I can find Utz 's chips . The only reason this rate 4 stars for our family is because we only seemed to have gotten one bag of the nacho chips , few of the plain or kettle cooked chips , and a TON of the regular bbq or salt and vinegar chips . If it had an even number of bags per product , we could enjoy this more . But overall these are the chips my hubby and kids love .	1
An update for July 2012Have ordered this assortment 4 times since my original review which I deleted to edit and add a new review.The company is now listing what you get in the package ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... .Case of 60 Assorted Snack Size Bags . The snack size bags range from 3/4 oz to 1-1/4 oz . The assortment includes Regular , BBQ , Sour Cream & Onion , Salt & Vinegar , Crab and Kettle Classic potato chips , Thin pretzels , Cheese Curls , White Cheddar popcorn and Party MixI am very glad to see this.Its no longer a wait and see what you get purchase.However you do still get more of some types than others.A very good product but the dates usually range from 4 to 8 weeks.Could be longer but still a great price and the few that I have eaten after the past best by date I could tell no difference.I hope these stay on site for sale because they have become a regular purchase for me .	1
Most of the varieties are fine . But the white cheddar popcorn is a little chewy and tastes meh . The party mix is n't great , and the & # 34 ; crab chips & # 34 ; are salty like the tears of a thousand jilted lovers . Otherwise though , thumbs-up	1
Some of the best pretzels come in these little bags : sour dough nuggets plain or with a delicious honey mustard coating , sticks , thin usual twist , unsalted potato chips , my fav , salted potatoe chips , barbeque , sour cream n chive , vinegar n salt , kettle chips , party snacks , cheese twists , It 's a tiny portion but that 's all right . It 's doing a great job curbing my indulgent tendencies .	1
This the first time I 've tried Utz chips . Never heard of them before . Wow ! They are delicious . I have n't tried all the flavors yet -- still working my way through them . But , I really like the crab flavored ones . I was n't sure what they 'd be like , but they taste like Old Bay crab boil seasoning ( which I really like ) . I will definitely reorder these . Plus you ca n't beat the price per pack when you compare to what you get out of the office vending machine .	1
I use these to top sugar cookies and scones , and they do a terrific job . They hold their sparkle , shape and crunch after being baked and taste good !	1
I tried unsuccessfully to locate this product for months in my local area . Finally , I tried Amazon , and they shipped it free with other items . I use this sparingly for obvious reasons , but it works exactly as it should work . I will now try to keep this on hand all the time , ordering a new one via Amazon when my present shaker gets below half way . Highly recommend for all bakers who need a little something on the top of some of your pastries and treats !	1
This is the best sparkling crystal sugar to make all your baked goods look like they were made by a professional artisan baker-which , of course , is YOU ! The 8 ounce jar contains one very full cup of sugar . You do n't need much to decorate a cupcake , cake , or cookie , this is very chunky and very sparkly . Just a pinch will do . I purchased this to top my homemade graham crackers . ( I make chocolate and raspberry grahams with Bobs Red Mill Organic Graham Flour ) Bob 's Red Mill Organic Graham Flour , 24-Ounce ( Pack of 4 ) . With this sparkling sugar , they look like they came from a very expensive , upscale bakery . Who needs to pay those prices ? With this sugar , you never have to . Your home made baked goods will make terrific , and very impressive gifts too . There are other colors , but white seems to be the most professional looking to me , It does n't detract from the other colors of your baked goods , especially colored frostings . All you get is sparkle ! There are 15 calories per teaspoon , 4 grams of sugar , 4 grams of carbs , no salt , no protein . ( did you actually expect protein ? ) . Allergy alert : The label also states that this product is made in a facility that processes peanuts , tree nuts , wheat , milk and soy . Yes , it is a bit expensive , but this will last a long time if you use it conservatively . Happy baking !	1
This sugar stays in its little crystals during the baking process so your sprinkling on the top of muffins makes them look professional . The little burst of crunch and sweetness when you bite into a crystal makes the muffin all the more special . I just made a batch of pumpkin muffins and a loaf of pumpkin bread . Since I reduce the amount of sugar I use , the muffins and bread are not overly sweet by themselves which makes this sprinkling of sweet crystals on the top an extra treat.You sprinkle the crystals on top of the unbaked item and they stay in place and intact throughout the baking process so you still see them sparkling on the finished item . It would work well on cupcakes and cookies also . The 8 oz jar is bigger than a jar of spices but not as big as you 'd think because sugar is relatively heavy , I guess . Still it will last through many baking projects . There is no shaker under the cap which I would have preferred . I did n't have trouble adding the amount I wanted to my muffins , but had to be careful and a spill would be a big mess . Overall I 'm very pleased with this product and will keep a jar handy ongoing .	1
If you want the real large kernel sanding sugar , this will do the job . Perfect for cookies or decorating candies .	1
It also did pretty wonderful things to my molasses crackles , because the crunchier sugar added to the texture . Very pleased .	1
Did what it said it would do , looked lovely on cookies for Christmas . Will try to post a photo next time I bake !	1
This is Wilton 's Sparkling sugar and it makes a beautiful sparkly Christmas cookie or also looks great on a cake to give it a glistening snow effect . This is a fun product .	1
These little diamonds are great to decorate cookies at holidays or just to roll cookies in for everyday . Also , do n't forget muffins or tea bread . Works nicely .	1
Wilton White Sparkling Sugar is the perfect dusting for snowflakes sugar cookies ! It is a perfect pairing with the Wilton snowflake comfort grip cookie cutter .	1
These crystals of sugar add sparkle to cookies that regular sugar does n't without being too sweet . Especially nice for a Christmas cookie plate . Priced competitively . Arrived in good condition .	1
from the first pressing of salted anchovies , 1 Tbsp Sodium 1360mg / 0 Sugar.that being said this is my favorite sauce so far and making for many great dishes..I personally love Thai coconut soups . flavor is great . never without it .	1
I bought this particular brand because we have food allergies in the house and this brand is very clear on their web site what products were contaminated with or contained what allergens . Other brands not so much . The fish sauce tastes as it should and I will order again .	1
I have used this sauce for years for making pad thai and other Asian dishes . This sauce is a great reliable sauce that is consistently good quality . I have never opened a bad bottle.I would recommend this fish sauce .	1
If you 're cooking Chinese , you 'll need fish sauce . If you 're cooking pasta , do not use this product . I 've been cooking Chinese a lot , and I ca n't stand not having all the necessary ingredients . I tried going to a Chinese supermarket but the clerks hardly speak English . It 's so much simpler to buy on Amazon .	1
Love it on my noodles and any Asian inspired dish that I am making . It only requires a little , so make sure you are comfortable with the amount that you need to use .	1
I can purchase this locally from a number of sources , including the dominant supermarket chain in Central Florida . Therefore my review will focus on this fish sauce and not address price or shipping.Not all fish sauces are created equal . I spent a lot of my life in Asia and was first introduced to this in the Philippines where it 's called patis . This is identical to a high quality patis in all respects . Do be aware that this , like patis or other Thai brands , is extremely high in sodium . A single gram of this sauce contains 890mg . That means that a teaspoon contains a whopping 4450mg , so use it very sparingly if you have sodium restrictions.My main use is to chop fresh bird 's eye peppers and make a combination dipping sauce and condiment that is called phrik nam pla in Thai . It 's also delicious by itself on on grilled eggplant and zucchini , and especially pork ( which I have not eaten in decades but did enjoy with this sauce when I did consume it . ) Actually , this is perfect on mixed grilled or fried vegetables and will enhance many dishes if used in lieu of salt or soy sauce.Bottom line : this is a quality fish sauce that is identical to patis and the equal of any brand I have used .	1
This creamy lotion fragranced with apricot is designed for mature or very dry skin.It is enriched with Green Tea Extract , Apricot Oil and Almond Oil intended to moisturize , smoothe , and soften skin.Plus there 's a dash of Panthenol to aid in skin cell renewal .	1
I 've had nothing but wonderful experiences with this lotion over the years . At times it IS the only lotion that can handle super tough dry skin issues on faces ( and scalp for you men ) while being super gentle . Recently recommended it to someone who used it on his face after shaving and said it stung horribly . I could see the redness reaction . Within a couple of weeks this settled down , but I was surprised at the initial reaction . Speaks to the necessity of a regular moisturizing regime for anyone , I suppose .	1
I love the smell of this cream ; it makes my elbows and feet feel softer and not sticky . I 'll buy it again .	1
Jason has been delivering trusted lotions for a very long time . I 've been enjoying numerous scents of Jason Lotions for several decades . Being a major lover of Lavender , I 've always been on the lookout for good Lavender lotions over the years , and there are few that have come close to this one , so I 've kept coming back to it.Some say that Jason has changed the formula of some of their lotions lately , such as this one and the Rosewater . I do n't know about that yet . So far , so good , in my experience to date . I truly hope Jason does continue to keep their scents true and the ingredients pure and natural . I have enjoyed many Jason lotion ` flavors ' , such as the Lavender , Rosewater , Apricot , Cocoa Butter and Chamomile , and they have all been ` delicious ' and kind to my family 's skin.Lavender calms , they say . That fragrance apparently helps you relax at night for slumbers , or other times . Thus , a Lavender lotion should be a good thing to put on before retiring or just to slow the pace and breathe deeply . If you love Lavender like I do , you might appreciate the scent of this lotion frequently too , and all while you will be nourishing and moisturizing your body . We 've especially used Jason lotions for feet and hands .	1
My wife got me started using Jason Lotion . I think it 's great . Only a very small amount is needed and no greasy film after putting it on . I ususally pay $ 10 for this in the store . So , the price is right on AND it gets delivered to my door . What a deal ! I ca n't even find it where I live , now . Certainly , not for this kind of price !	1
Jason Vanilla Hand and Body Therapy is a great stand-by because it is a rich , moisturizing lotion that does n't leave skin greasy or slimy . It leaves skin soft and smooth - I use it to moisturize my hands each night before going to bed and wake up with soft , moisturized skin . The one thing that I do n't love about it is the scent that tends to linger for a few minutes after applying the lotion ( while the vanilla scent is delicate , there is a bit of a musky smell at first until the lotion dries - after that , there is no odor , and the vanilla aroma is faint and pleasant ) .	1
My Mom used Glycerine and Rose Water hand lotion back in the 50 's and I have always loved the smell . Plus , I find it works better then the fancy new ones . My hands are soft , smell great , and do n't feel greasy .	1
I personally prefer Neutrogena foot cream for desert dry feet but this is a rare find for the amount of Aloe and is what granny prefers ( no one that I can find still sells a 100 % cream ) for serious desert dry AND aged skin . Most creams are watered down today for casual use , but that stuff does nothing for where it 's often below 4 % humidity . And , I was able to buy it here for much less , Recommended .	1
The product description calls the Orangettes `` Belgian Vitamin C. '' Except for the luxury price , I 'm sure Belgians must be pretty healthy with these around . They 're amazing ! The combination of orange peel and chocolate has long been popular , but Leonidas does it very well . The dark chocolate is very rich , not bitter , and completely covers the orange peel ( which retains a good flavor and is n't overly sweet ) . Unlike other chocolatiers who often dip the peel only partially , Leonidas has made certain to put their chocolate center stage by using a generous portion . The result is an addictive treat because the flavors linger on the palate and the Orangettes are n't so sweet as to become cloying.I do n't know if these guys are really going to improve your health , but they will definitely improve your day . In my opinion , they 're worth the money as an occasional purchase and certainly worth a one-time try.The packaging is a gold box , wrapped in blue and white Leonidas paper with a gilt deep purple box . For shipping , the package was placed inside a sturdy styrofoam shell . Mine arrived within three days and looked like I 'd purchased them at the store to give as a gift .	1
This was my dad 's absolute favorite candy . He loved orange and bittersweet chocolate best of any flavors and this was , for him a match made in heaven . I adore it as well . After my dad passed away , I found a stash of them in his cupboard . They are n't easy to find , but they make a most welcome after-dinner sweet with coffee for guests .	1
Me who has dual nationalities - belgo-swiss - i can not resist ordering these specialities from Belgium.It is a treat to have with a cup of good coffee , that is how it is served in Belgium anyway ! the same forSwitzerland where any cup of coffee is presented with a square of dark or milk chocolate .	1
I purchased these chocolate covered orange peels from multple companies over the years and these are the best so far !	1
even it is abit expensive to buy sometimes , but I find that the quality is exceptional , great taste , great packaging , and still cheaper than some other brands with a better taste . The texture and taste are just right ! The shipping comes in 2 days , great wrap and bow like its for a present , comes in a foam box . I never had any shipping problems at all .	1
When and actually every time you reach into this box you do not know what your getting . You will not be disappointed though , because the surprise is worth the suspense ! ! ! These Chocolates are as good as any of the Best Chocolates out there . If your a Dark Chocolate lover buy these for yourself or give as a present to someone who will appreciate the thoughtfulness of you and Leonidas.I know what I will be buying for Mothers day and Valentines day and again for myself when I finish these . Good Luck.PS you may want to check if they deliver these in the Summer Time because of the Temps .	1
These made my Mom 's day . She LOVES dark chocolate and this was a treasure trove for her and she ca n't thank me enough for sending these . She says they 're smoother , less bitter and less sweet than Hershey 's .	1
I really did n't know much about this type of chocolate and took a chance and got a box . This was a Christmas present for my wife but after all the good stuff we read we had to break into it a month early . I thought to myself how much differently could this really taste than the American chocolate I am used to . It comes in a box that you get to unwrap and untie the bow . This chocolate is the best ever and after tasting and finishing off the entire box we could n't wait to get another . That will have to wait though for the price but it was worth what we paid . Do yourself a favor and pay the price just to try it out .	1
Unfortunately I never had a chance to try these chocolates . However , I sens them to my boss and my uncle just a few days back and both of them said , these are GREAT !	1
My wife loves dark chocolate . She formerly ate only Godiva , but when that company changed form vanilla to vanillin , she no longer liked it . She LOVES this stuff . She says that you can taste the fresh and she does n't want anything else .	1
If it is possible to fall madly in love with a box of chocolates , then the assortment is the perfect place to start such an adventure . These chocolate are named after Leonidas Kestekidis , who definitely knew how to create chocolates for the true chocolate connoisseur.When he moved back to Belgium he not only married his true love , he created chocolates the world now adores . When you taste these chocolates , your taste buds will also finally know true chocolate happiness . Whether you try one of these with a cup of coffee or tea or enjoy one as a daily indulgence , these will impress.If being `` in love '' gives you a zest for life , then the `` I Love You '' chocolate with dreamy lemon filling embodies this sentiment . Each chocolate has a unique design and the I Love You chocolate has two hearts , ribbons and a seal . After you sample the variety of chocolates , specific flavors will stand out as favorites.Here are my favorite creamy fillings ( ganache and butter cream ) which come in dark , white and milk chocolate depending on the selection ( dark if you order this box ) : Antoinette - A smooth Brandy flavored ganacheLingoit Lait - Absolutely delicious vanilla flavored fresh butter cream filling . Time definitely stopped while tasting this chocolate.Irr & eacute ; sistible - Dark chocolate and Strawberry sauce.For ever - If you love coffee this may be one of the most delicious milk or dark chocolate chocolates ever made as it is filled with a special coffee cream that has hints of caramel . I ordered an entire box of these and they come in a variety of flavors . The milk chocolate and cherry filling is like Claude Debussy 's Rverie . It is difficult to describe besides saying it is like a delicate cherry icing wrapped in milk chocolate.Merveilleux - Milk or dark chocolate filled with coffee ganache.Europe - Dark or milk chocolate filled with rum filling.Ganache - Milk or dark chocolate with pure ganache.Tosca - Milk chocolate with a special ganache.Po & eacute ; sie - Dark chocolate and a Cointreau filling.Antoinette - Delicate caramel hints in the milk chocolate coating mingle nicely with the vanilla filling.Eve - Milk or dark chocolate with a creamy dreamy banana filling.Alexandre le grand - A milk or dark chocolate with caramel cream.Also Recommended : If you wish to also try the Napolitains , I 'd suggest the 1 pound sampler Ballotin with six varieties . You may also want to look for the new Palet d'Or . A deeply delicious and strong bitter chocolate filled with ganache . The center is made with butter , cream and chocolate and the outer coating is a masterpiece with gold decorations.Leonidas now has over 1700 stores and sales locations worldwide and they offer over 80 varieties of fresh chocolates . The chocolates are air freighted weekly from Brussels so you will always find the quality to be superior.My chocolates arrived fast and were as fresh as if I had purchased them in Belgium . They were carefully packaged in the famous gold boxes with signature/seasonal wrapping and a ribbon . The boxes were then placed in protective Styrofoam containers to protect the chocolates during shipping . The expedited shipping is recommended from May to early September.~The Rebecca Review	1
Said they were among the best chocolates she 's ever had.So that is good enough for me . They arrived sooner than advertised so I was happy .	1
Leonidas is the best chocolate I have ever eaten ! I am not exaggerating in my description , I bought a few brands of chocolate described as the best in the world as a present , this without a doubt lives up to its a reputation . It is without a doubt worth the expensive price tag , the dark chocolates are the best of the best .	1
This was a very high quality flour - superfine and so great for making non-gritty gluten-free foods . If you can afford the cost , including shipping , you will want to spend the extra to get this product . However , with the amount of GF baking I do , the cost of this product was just too high for us . We now use our VitaMix dry-grains container to grind Lundberg organic brown rice into our own rice flour . We order that here on Amazon , and it 's grown in CA so it has no arsenic contamination like rice from other areas . After grinding , we sift it to make sure all the grit is gone . It 's not quite as fine as this product , but for the price difference , it 's what we are doing for now .	1
Awesome product , will buy again ! So happy to have found this flour.it 's the best superfine flour that I have found so far .	1
This is nice flour , finely ground and does n't leave a gritty after taste . All GF recipe books recommend this product .	1
I purchased this in order to mix up some of Gluten Free on a Shoestring 's & # 34 ; Better than Cup4Cup & # 34 ; flour blend . This superfine Brown Rice Flour ( along with the superfine white rice flour , tapioca starch and potato starch I also bought ) worked beautifully.I 'm really impressed with the quality of the grind .	1
I use this flour exclusively for my flour blends that call for brown rice flour . Superfine is a true adjective for this product . It makes all of my baked goods indistinguishable from their wheat counterparts .	1
Gritty rice flour makes for unpleasant baked goods , so I was happy to find this superfine rice flour from Authentic Foods . It has gotten the best reviews of all rice flours , and it has worked very well for me .	1
Just found a flour recipe using brown rice flour for gluten free cookies . Tops over the sorghum mixture I had been using .	1
I use brown rice flour in most of the gluten-free blends I make . It 's important that the flour I use is finely ground . Authentic Foods is the only brand that meets my standards for texture and mild taste . Whether it is crepes , cookies , bread or pot stickers , no one thinks it 's gluten-free . They just say how delicious the recipe is .	1
Tried it and lovvved it ! Good mixed with other flours .	1
Husband enjoys baking gluten free foods with Authentic Foods Brown Rice Flour . superfine . Buying on line helps because I do not have to get out and drive on busy roads . I buy from Amazon.com because I do n't pay for shipping .	1
This flour is amazing . I 've used brown rice flour in my gluten-free baking for years . This particular one is so finely ground , there 's no typical grit at all in the final product . I never even knew any rice flour could be this soft and smooth.If you bake with rice flours , this one gives a nice smooth final product , but still gives you the flavor and slight protein benefits of brown rice .	1
I love this brand of gluten-free flours . The quality is very consistent and I never have any problems with the items I bake using their flours . Other flours , it is always hard to tell what you are going to get , but I thoroughly trust Authentic Foods to give me a great product at a reasonable price .	1
This product is not even organic so I do not know where they come up with $ 17- $ 19 for a 3-lb bag ! That is what I have been paying for it through Amazon.com . Will be searching for less priced merchants . Very good product - makes baked goods so much better than regular ( grainy ) brown rice flour . This bag will not last very long if you do a reasonable amount of baking so make sure to have plenty on hand .	1
I love this flour for making cakes or baked goods . It is very finely ground which takes away from that gritty taste you get with most rice flours . Many company 's claim to have finely ground rice flour but this is the only one I have found that is truly ground to a fine level . I do n't use this flour for bread because the recipe that I have makes a good bread without this particular flour and this one is rather expensive so I only use it for finer baked goods .	1
I cook and bake gluten free and rice flour is a big part of it.I love that this comes in a 3lb bag and really does the job.Very happy , Carol	1
I purchased this in order to mix up some of Gluten Free on a Shoestring 's & # 34 ; Better than Cup4Cup & # 34 ; flour blend . This superfine White Rice Flour ( along with the brown rice flour , tapioca starch and potato starch I also bought ) worked beautifully.I 'm really impressed with the quality of the grind .	1
I usually grind my own flours , but I wanted a totally non-gritty white flour and this fits the bill . It is an important addition to most gluten free baked goods . Everything I 've cooked with it has turned out very well . I highly recommend Gluten-Free Baking Classics by Annalise G. Roberts for really tasty recipes that work . They are n't 'health food ' but they hit the spot when one feels deprived when eating gluten free .	1
I have several blends I make for specific qualities . This superfine white rice flour has a very bland flavor and binds well . It is not a substitute for white wheat flour . To mimic wheat several flours with different qualities are combined . I also add egg white powder , unflavored gelatin and/or egg replacer when needed . Cooking gluten-free brings out your inner chemist !	1
This is the rice flour for gluten-free cooking . Unlike other rice flours , the super-fine grind is not gritty so baked goods can have the same smooth finish as those made from wheat flours . If tightly wrapped , it keeps indefinitely in the freezer so one can afford to buy it in bulk . I also highly recommend Authentic Foods ' superfine brown rice flour and gluten-free flour blend . My wheat-eating husband says the cinnamon rolls I baked with it are the best he 's ever eaten , wheat or no wheat , gluten or no gluten . If you 've been disappointed with other brands , as we were , you really should try this .	1
My uses for this flour have been gluten-free pancakes , cakes , muffins , and cornbread . It 's true , this flour is more finely ground than most white rice flours that are commercially available -- even those that say they are very fine . If you bake gluten-free , you know sometimes the texture can be gritty despite your best efforts . Breads and cakes can turn out flavorful , but dense , overly heavy , and still crumbly . My recipes turn out much smoother , lighter , and fluffier with this flour . I cut it in conjunction with others depending on the recipe , and it 's turned out great results each time.It does n't cost much more than grocery store brands , but the final result is worth the slight increase in price . Definitely recommend this flour for gluten-free baking .	1
I accidentally ordered this , I was really looking for sweet white rice . But , I figured it 's a gluten-free flour I 'll find some uses for it . I certainly have , it works great for making pasta . I 've also put it in quite a few recipes and have found great success .	1
This flour is a great substitute for wheat in bread recipes . I uses it to make Brazilian bread . The recipe only calls for an egg , cup and a half tapioca flour , 1/2 of milk , garlic and onion powder and 1/2 cup of olive oil . It also tastes great as a pizza crust . This is a great brand for celiacs to use .	1
I purchased this in order to mix up some of Gluten Free on a Shoestring 's & # 34 ; Better than Cup4Cup & # 34 ; flour blend . This tapioca starch ( along with the white & brown rice flour , and potato starch I also bought ) worked beautifully.I 'm used to the tapioca flour/starch you can find in asian food markets , and this seemed the same , though GFOAS recommended avoiding those and buying this .	1
Good product , but the powder/flour gets in the way of the zipper and it wo n't close . No big deal ... I just put it in another bag . But , Authentic Foods could likely save money by using a 'regular ' bag instead .	1
great addition to the gluten free pantry . Makes gravies and sauces an pudding too . good to add to flour mixes .	1
Great quality , works well in all my recipes and could n't beat the price ! Very happy with the product . My only previous experience is with Bob 's Red Mill and since I really only use this in combination with other flours and starches , I ca n't really say that I notice any difference in taste , texture , etc , but the price per ounce was quite a bit less .	1
This is quite the buy on Tapioca frour since it is gluten free , dairy free , soy free , nut free and non-GMO which is a biggie in my world . It is made in the United States , assuming California is not in the ocean yet ! They make over 30 products so when I replenish my other alternative flours I will be looking for the Authentic Foods label . I have not baked with this yet but it looks , feels and tastes exactly like the more expensive stuff .	1
Authentic Foods has the best quality products I have used for gluten free baking . Tapioca is used in three of the gluten free baking blends I use . I use it in cookies , pastry , and breads .	1
Preferred brand . It works MUCH better in recipes like Brazilian cheese rolls , that need only tapioca starch instead of flour . I tried to make them using Bobs but ended up with a gooey mess .	1
makes gluten free and wheat bakery products both better . The gluten free products I add it to are not as crumbly as they are without it .	1
This product worked good for me . I am always searching for good gluten free products and I consider this one of them . I think that it improved my baked products . It is certainly worth the try if you are hoping to enhance and improve your gluten free baked items .	1
I would n't consider baking my whole-wheat bread without sing Dough Enhancer . They would turn to bricks overnight . That does n't happen for me when I use the Dough Enhancer.The Authentic Foods Dough Enhancer comes in a handy jar , which makes it easier to use than boxes or bags . I recommend it .	1
For GF breads I think apple cider vinegar works better . I very well may be great for wheat breads , though . I would hate to give it a poor rating just because it does n't work for me but I will just stick to the vinegar and save my money .	1
works as it is suppose to . Am using it as I experiment with making my own whole grain breads . Seems to be fresh .	1
It was perfect and I found the little baby adorable . The outside was a lot softer than I thought but it was great when I made sushi . XD	1
I never liked mayonnaise until I went to Japan , where I gained a new respect and appreciation for the condiment . The reason ? Japanese mayo is different . And it tastes better.Before that , I was only familiar with standard American supermarket varieties like Hellman 's and Kraft , and the idea of putting them on things like leaf salads and fries was n't particularly appealing.Kewpie , though the ingredients are similar , has a pronounced tanginess that balances the rich creamy texture , making it ideal as a mainline topping for a wide variety of foods . They go great on fries ( Belgian style ) , leaf salads , and grilled meats . Japanese people put mayo on a lot of things , including okonomiyaki , takoyaki , yakitori , even pizza.There is something decidedly fun about the squirt nozzle . It is much more convenient than American jar mayos that you have to scoop out and then plop onto the food in a big glob . The bottle itself is shaped like a pastry bag , with an opening about the diameter of a strand of cooked spaghetti . This allows you to squirt mayo with precision over your food , letting you control its distribution as well as design . Food I had in Japan often came with cross-hatched mayo patterns , like the pattern you see on the bag . If you remove the cap , the inner opening is star shaped , allowing for more decorating fun if you have kids.It is far superior toKraft Mayo Real Mayonnaise , 18-Ounce Easy Squeeze Bottles , which come in an overly-rigid bottle with a horizontal slot that easily introduces air into the bottle as it re-inflates for the next squeeze , causing frequent splatter . Mayo also clings to the bottle 's side and I have to give it a good hard jerk to get enough dislodged for another squeeze . Kewpie does n't have this problem . It is soft and pliable like a toothpaste tube . Splattering is never an issue and the free-flowing consistency of the mayo formulation makes getting it all out quite easy . The bottle is also transparent and devoid of any stickers and labels , making it easy to see how much is left , and its tapered design channels the mayo into the opening.Nutrition values are similar to American mayo . 100 calories per tablespoon ( 90 from fat ) , 20mg cholesterol , 100mg sodium . It does not contain any preservatives or artificial additives besides MSG . Kewpie is made in Japan , not in US subsidiary factories , so this is a true taste of a Japanese favorite . Give it a try and see why this is loved by so many people in Japan and Japanese food lovers the world over .	1
I purchase this mayonnaise regularly , usually more than one bottle at a time . I use it for making Japanese dynamite sauce , although it is very nice in sandwiches as well . This mayonnaise has a flat taste to it , and is not at all sweetened like American-style mayonnaise.The product is tops but the packaging is a little odd . The mayonnaise itself comes in a squeeze bottle , and the squeeze bottle is packaged in the red-printed cellophane bag you see in the picture . Well , when you remove the bottle from the cellophane bag , you are left with a plain bottle , with no markings on it whatsoever . You will know what is in the squeeze bottle , but others wo n't , so you just need to communicate that to anybody that has access to your refrigerator.A nice little bonus is that the cap on the squeeze bottle has a rosette tip , so you can make fancy little mayonnaise decorations straight out of the bottle if the occasion arises .	1
I 've wanted to try Kewpie & # 34 ; Japanese & # 34 ; mayonnaise for a while , having read about it on a lot of recipe sites . People speak so highly of it that I was really curious , but I could n't find it anywhere locally.The flavor is not what I expected , it is much eggier and tangier than regular Hellman 's mayonnaise . Th flavor is somehow also lighter , and does n't linger as much in your mouth . It is much less oily.I love the fine-tipe squirt bottle , especially for Japanese food . It makes it easier to & # 34 ; frost & # 34 ; food as a topping . I do n't know that I would call it a replacement for regular American mayonnaise , and I 'm not particularly fond of it with meat , like on a sandwich . But it gives a great tangy creaminess to veggies , sushi , omelets , and sauces .	1
I always used to hate mayonnaise , and could n't imagine using it as a regular condiment . Turns out I just hated American mayonnaise.Japanese mayonnaise is made with rice vinegar and a spice called ajinomoto , which gives it a hint of the flavor called umami . Umami is a special flavor , found mainly in Asian cooking , that can be detected by the human tounge outside the four basic tastes of sweetness , sourness , bitterness and saltiness . Japanese mayonnaise is much better for cooking , especially for making salad dressings . That hint of umami makes all the difference.Kewpie brand is the most popular brand of Japanese mayonnaise , and so it is a bit of a comfort food like Heinz ketchup is to Americans . Aside from tasting great , it is just nice to see the familiar bottle sitting in the fridge , knowing you can pull it out at any time and make your tacoyaki taste just that much better .	1
This is another great dressing from Walden Farms . It 's calorie-free but has great taste . As a warning , I should note that it 's vinegar-based ( not cream-based ) , so if you do n't like vinegar , you might not have the same liking for this dressing that I do , but I am definitely hooked on this and other Walden Farms dressings .	1
For a zero-cal dressing , this is good and gets the job done . I prefer the blue cheese myself . This one is a close second , and I love the taste , but it may not be right for everyone . The flavor is right on , but it has an odd aftertaste that sticks with you long after you 've consumed the product . I would recommend refrigerating it even before you open the packaging . It will make the consistency much thicker and the dressing more enjoyable .	1
I almost did n't try this because I bought the Walden Farms chocolate sauce and marshmallow sauce several years ago and they were awful . But thanks to Amazon reviews , I decided enough people liked the salad dressings that I should give them a chance.I found this at my local Fred Meyer ( Kroger family ) for a few pennies over $ 5 . The FM stores in Boise have a little diet food section , and that 's where I found it . I bought the Bacon Ranch , and I must say it 's pretty good . I had a full bowl of salad with plenty of dressing ( I like lots ! ) for just 20 calories . Very cool ! I wonder how this would taste on shiritaki ( yam ) noodles ? I think I 'll try that tomorrow .	1
Understanding that these are diet Salad Dressings , having no fat , no gluten , no carbs , no sugar , and no calories , will go a long way in forgiving a weaker taste than in their full calorie counter parts.The two flavors we bought ( Caesar and Honey Dijon ) are good tasting and enjoyable.Recommended !	1
very good , this is the best zero calories dressing I have ever tried , very good no after taste , will recomned to others	1
This is not bad , it 's good on a salad , and decent as a veggie dip as well . It 's very tangy , and nice in it 's own way but does not taste like a normal full fat ranch dressing . It 's on par with other low fat or light dressings I have tried , but with 0 calories . I like to add a little cracked black pepper to mine . I may buy this again , but I prefer their Caesar dressing .	1
Although I detest most reduced-calorie dressings , I like the Walden Farms Ranch dressing . I have no idea how this can have zero calories . Keep in mind , though , that if you 're used to the high-calorie dressings , you 'll spit this out with disdain . However , if you , like I , avoid such indulgences , then your palate is ready for Walden Farms Ranch .	1

I wo n't eat most light or fat free dressings because if you read the label , what they take out , they generally replace with sugar and sugar spikes my appetite big time and yet , a 1 TBS serving of my favorite regular Hidden Valley Ranch dressing does n't even begin to cover my salad the way I 'd like . I 'd need at least 3 TBS to make it how I want and that 's just too much fat for one meal . It 's almost the RDA for an entire day so that 's not really feasible for me.What to do ? ? I was THRILLED to find this dressing at my local supermarket . I think it tastes `` okay '' right out of the bottle but to my tastebuds , it does leave something to be desired . To make it into something I look forward to eating , I do the following : Hidden Valley Ranch has such a strong flavor so I can take 1 TBS of it , 2 TBS of Walden Farms Ranch dressing and approximately 2 TBS of water . Mix well and I have enough dressing for a good sized salad - about 1.5 to 2 cups of greens and it tastes GOOD to me . I do n't feel at all deprived and I 'm getting fewer calories ( there are 70 calories in 1 TBS of Hidden Valley Ranch dressing ) and it 's plenty thick for what I want it to do and that 's cover the salad . I do n't want it drenched exactly but I want that ranch flavor with every bite . I eat this dressing almost exclusively now on any kind of salad - turkey taco , chef , asian greens , etc.Sometimes I 'll add 1 TBS of flaxseed oil to the mix to get the benefit of the omega 3 's however , be aware that 1 TBS of flaxseed oil has approximately 120 calories in it so if you 're watching calories then take that into consideration.The above recipe is also not a bad dip for veggies though it is somewhat thin in consistency . I like it best on salads .	1
I like most of the Wlden Farms items i 've bought from Amazon . This was for my sister-in-law , and she loves it .	1
CALORIE FREE SUGAR FREE FAT FREE SLUTEN FREE CARB FREE CHOLESTEROL FREE ! ? ? ? ! ? ! ? MUST HAVE ! ! ! ! , lol ; ) Got this from Save Mart for around $ 8 ... ..dont try the Honey Dijon , it is DISGUSTING ... has a bad after taste : /	1
Surprisingly great flavor and now the family likes this best - even better than standard counter dressings ! We were pleasantly excited and will order more !	1
I love this dressing . I use it pretty much with everything . This year I decided to get serious about my weight ( and lost 23 lbs by the way ) and with some pokes from my friends I went to HCG diet ( along with those friends ) . In my doc office I was introduced to Walden Farms products , although I 've never heard of them before . Being an on and off dieter since I can remember , that would be shame on me . I am in love with their products now . Well , most of them . This Russian dressing is one of my favorites along with Chocolate dip . I use it with everything . Cucumbers , tomatoes , spinach . It goes well with everything . It tastes good , it 's light and calorie free . And I might get addicted to low calorie eating after all . Dieting becomes fun when it tastes good .	1
Received it today and smothered some baked pork chops . Sauces was tangy and tasty with no after taste . Will probably use this even after my low carb diet ends .	1
I do n't like BBQ sauce that much , but my husband loves it . Our diet does n't allow us to have the caloric stuff anymore so I thought I 'd try this one out . It does have a strong hickory smoked flavor and smell to me , but my husband said it was quite good and wants me to order it by the case . If he had written the review it would have gotten 5 stars .	1
very good bbq sauce	1
The barbeque Sauce Honey from Walden Farms has a great taste with no calories , no sugar . Great product , I would recommend to anyone .	1
The other reviews of the Walden Farms BBQ Sauce made it sound like something you would scrape off the bottom of your shoe , wipe on your meat and promptly barf . I , however was pleasantly surprised to find the Original Sauce to be very tasty . The spice level was well balanced with the acidity and sweetness . No chemical aftertaste of Splenda . I am a foodie , but my doctor has me on a ridiculously low calorie diet for the next few months . After the past three weeks , I was desperate for variety and this fit the bill perfectly ! Bare in mind , this is NOT regular barbeque sauce though . It is thinner , but what would you expect from a no calorie , no carb sauce ? If you are needing variety in your menu , give this a try . You might just find an unexpected delight !	1
This is an acquired taste - you might not even like it at first . It is not vinegary like some of the WF products . I 'd describe it as more robust , spicy enough for a guy who loves heat , and smoky . My wife is n't a fan , but she 's not on a diet or willing to give it a chance . She does n't like smoky food , either . I can say that after two or three meals it has grown on me and it is a staple as long as I 'm on Atkins .	1
I 've tried three flavors now and like the honey the best . The thick and spicy is just that - great , but a bit too smoky and hot for me . Keep these coming , Walden Farms ! Makes those bleak diet days a whole lot brighter !	1
I use this everyday on diet pancakes . Tastes like the real thing to me . It is not in my food store and am glad I can get it at amazon .	1
because every other Walden Farms product I 've tried - salad dressings , sauces , etc . - ranged from barely edible to downright nasty . I refused to purchase this pancake syrup for years because of the bad experiences with the other stuff . But , for some reason , I put a bottle of it in my shopping cart 2 weeks ago . Husband has been requesting my SF/LC waffles so I made some up for dinner and we tried this syrup . Well color me surprised ! It was actually BETTER than edible - it was GOOD ! SO , I am eating crow ( probably should add some syrup , huh ? ) at this time because I have often declared I 'd never buy another Walden Farms product.I may , in fact , buy a case of this pancake syrup . There is another one I love , Joseph 's , which is actually a bit thicker and richer than the WF , BUT it is made of maltitol , which means that more than about 2 tablespoons of it renders me unfit for human companionship . The WF syrup , being sweetened with sucralose ( Splenda ) has no such affect on me whatsoever , so for the minimal differences in flavor and thickness , this is what I 'll be using from now on . Thanks WF - I 'm glad I tried this one !	1
I buy this now and then at a local grocery store . It is pretty good stuff . It is not as good as real sugar type syrups , but for a no sugar and very low carb , low calorie product , I have not found anything that beats it . It is not quite as thick as regular syrup , but it is not far off.It uses sucralose as a sweetener.I emailed and asked . They told me it is 0.4 carbs and 4 calories per serving . But for this product the serving size is a generous 1/4 cup.So I give it 5 stars for what it is - a low carb , low calorie maple syrup substitute.Where I get it , it is almost $ 5 a bottle , and there are just 6 servings per bottle , so it is kind of pricey . I do n't use a lot of it , but I have been using it for several years now and while they changed the label at least once that I recall , the syrup is just as good as ever .	1
Have always been on the low car diet . I use this syrup on waffles and , yes , Johnsonville extra hot sausage . It is great tasting ... .will continue to buy as I run out .	1
This syrup is wonderful , I am a diabetic and would recommend this ! It is much thicker then the syrups in the store .	1
I followed someone else 's advice and added yellow mustard to this syrup to make a zero calorie honey-mustard salad dressing . That was pretty good , but then I used it over my 100 gm boiled chicken breast , and wow ! It was incredible . Ca n't wait until I 'm not dieting and try it on almond flour blueberry pancakes !	1
All is fine with this product and the manufacturer . I WISH they make it with Stevia or Splenda , but since it is used rarely , I expect not to develop cancer ... lolIt is overpriced here on Amzn , so I must recommend buying from manufacture ... tho , this Amzn thingy is quite convenient .	1
This syrup tasted great to me ! I had it over low carb pancakes and it was delicious . Now to stay away from them so I do n't overeat . I had bought another popular brand named sugar free syrup made with sugar alcohols , did not taste good at all . I hate sugar alcohols . but this product has sucralose instead and a pleasant maple flavor . Walden Farms never let me down on taste .	1
This one of the few WF products that does not smell/taste like paint stripper . It is even very good ! I will definitely continue using this product once I am off the diet .	1
Use coconut oil inside and out wonderful for heart and skin health , having it in capsule form helps make sure my husband takes it and ensure I get enough even on days when I want to cook with another healthy oil like olive , grapeseed or rice brand .	1
My primary reason for buying this product was to help my digestive system . I have iron deficiency anemia , but I could not tolerate any brand of iron supplement , and the shots were extremely painful . So I became extremely anemic and needed transfusions . Consequently , I could n't take a chance anymore on not using iron tablets and I had to find a way to take them without suffering.Because I use coconut oil and milk in my cooking and for skin/hair care , I 've done research on the benefits of this amazing seed , and I thought that these capsules might help me to tolerate iron tablets . Well they have , and I am now able to tolerate 3 daily doses of ferrous sulfate , so I 'm in compliance with my doctors orders and my hemoglobin level is rising .	1
I bought this for my father and he liked it , asked for more ! Ca n't say much more since I did not consume it myself .	1
I found this brand here on Amazon and I take this every day now after meals . I love that this product is extra virgin so has all the coconut nutrition included in the capsule-which are large but easy to swallow .	1
I have been taking these for a while now . I have them on reorder all the time . This really helps the body .	1
Purchased this and Flaxseed Oil to help punch up my HDL `` good '' cholesterol levels . Not sure how it is working yet but they seem to work fine and I feel better taking them . We also use Coconut oil in bulk form for cooking as the fat composition is supposed to be better for you than other vegetable oils . As for capsules , I have read other reviews that say these `` taste bad '' ... . but I have never had this problem . Because they are capsules I am unsure how anyone could taste them anyway , unless they were punctured or chewed . They are rather large capsules , but they go down fine . I would recommend them .	1
The price : content mix on this NOW Virgin Coconut Oil product , is hard to beat . I 'm trying it for the first time , and added it to my already varied/daily vitamin regime . I do n't see any 'super amazing ' results , however I DO BELIEVE in the qualities of coconut oil , and have moved from slathering it on my body to taking it inside the body too ! Look-up 'coconut oil benefits , ' and you too can select NOW with confidence .	1
U can not get the benefits anywhere else . I eat about 2 pills during my health regime in the morning , ad then later if I am eating lots of fat-soluble vitamins . DO NOT listen to what people say , avocado and coconut are NOT high in fat in the sense that nasty junk that hangs off and is yellow and surrounds tissue . its a fat u can not get enough of and helps absorb vitamin K , so good to pair up with kale and leafy greens .	1
These are easy to swallow , I take them with other supplements that should be taken with oils/fats . I trust NOW Foods for my suppplements .	1
I did n't know that taking coconut oil softgels would help me be more alert and feel full . I am overweight so the additional fat is a little much but I suppose the fact that I eat much less when I take them may be a trade off . I do feel better on the days I take them .	1
I love this oil ! I use it on my body , hair and to cook with and just love it.It 's just would of those great for all most everything oil's.Smells great and feels great on my skin .	1
I never used Coconut Oil of any kind , I like Coconut but not a Big Fan . I was surprised to see that `` Now Foods Virgin Coconut Oil '' is congealed into a Thick White Paste with the Aroma of Coconut . An Oil that is good for just about everything , 1 Tablespoon has 120 Calories . I have used it in Baking and Cooking instead of Butter with excellent results and the aroma of Coconut is not that noticeable . I have also applied it to my face , made it Nice and Soft ... Next I want to try it on my Scalp to see if it will Grow Thicker Hair ... Coconut Oil is Recommended as a Supplement , take 1 Tablespoon 1 to 4 Times daily , maybe use it as a Spread or added to Salad Dressings and SmoothiesFOR COOKING : Use it in Place of Butter , Margarine , Shortening or other Cooking Oils , for Baking or Frying in Temperatures up to 350F degreesFOR SKIN CARE : Use it as a Moisturizer Lotion , Place Jar in warm water to Liquefy , Massage small amounts onto the SkinFOR HAIR CARE : Use it as a Conditioner , Place Jar in warm water to Liquefy , then apply 2 teaspoons to the Hair 1 to 2 Hours before WashingCoconut Oil is a Natural Energy , it contains High levels of Healthy type of fat called MCTs `` Medium Chain Triglycerides '' Pure Form of Coconut Oil , MCTs are different from other Fats primarily because they are Digested much more easily and efficiently . This makes them an extremely efficient Energy Source much more than Sugar . Also MCTs do n't add to Fat Cells or form Artery Hardening Plaque as readily as other Fats . Coconut Oil is a good addition to my Physical Activity Exercise and Weight Loss Programs . I like the Pure Extra Virgin Coconut Oil to the point that has become a Staple in my Kitchen ! ... Thank You D.D .	1
Hello ! First time I buy this type of product . I decided to order a bottle after reading of the health benefits . The aroma is really very pleasing . Reminds me of a tropical place where coconuts grow . I find the capsules easy to swallow . The oil has a pleasing taste . I just had to bite a couple of capsules to find out how the coconut oil tastes . I will buy again . If you like to add natural healthy supplements to meal times I would recommend NOW Foods Virgin Coconut Oil .	1
Milka is one of the leading producers of chocolates in the world . Founded in Switzerland in 1901 , the brand quickly spread throughout Western Europe . In 1990 , the company was acquired by Kraft , and their wonderful chocolate is now available throughout the world ! I love Milka 's Alpine Milk chocolate . It is absolutely delicious - not as sweet as many American chocolates , and with a rich and creamy texture . Want to try a great chocolate ? Get Milka 's Alpine Milk chocolate ! ( Review of World 's Best Milka Chocolate - Alpine Milk )	1
Even REDUCED FOR QUICK SALE -- this Chocolate is DA BOMB ! ! ! Some of the most delicious ever !	1
Bought these for stocking stuffers , taste is fine , but not as smooth or creamy as Lindt milk Chocolate , first taste is a little waxy , and the after taste is sweet and slightly granular ... . price was reasonable , although I would n't send for them again as I can buy Lindt for the same price locally , hard to compare the ingredient list as these are made in Europe . My First impression is that when a European Chocolate maker thought of as the best was bought by an American Company , something in the ingredients may have been altered ... ... ... .. my opinion ... Overall , it is a fine , nice tasting milk chocolate ... .. would n't necessarily call it the Worlds Best ... but I am sure the friends I am giving these to will be pleased.. !	1
I never thought I would actually be reviewing milk chocolate here on 'Amazon ' , but in this case , I just had to since i 'm sitting here salivating like 'Pavlovs dog ' . For years , I have been ranting and raving about how phenomenally great and smooth 'Lacta ' milk chocolate ( from 'Kraft Foods ' division in Greece ) tastes , but I could not find it here in the states . As a milk chocoholic , I would actually have my cousins in Greece send me a box of 24 bars about once a year , until now . Just today , I randomly discovered this 'Milka ' brand on sale at my local 'Giant Eagle ' supermarket , and was 'blown away ' by the taste ! My immediate reaction was that it tastes just like 'Lacta ' ... EUREKA ! Upon reading the label , I noticed that it is made by a division of 'Kraft Foods ' in Germany . My guess is that this is the same as a 'Lacta ' bar , but it was renamed and repackaged for the German and export market . In any case , if you love superior tasting milk chocolate , you owe it to yourself to get your hands on 'Milka Alpenmilch ' . I would rank this as the world 's BEST TASTING and unique milk chocolate , or in the top 2 or 3 ever . It 's THAT GOOD !	1
I sent these to my cousin who said she needed chocolate to get through the stress of a serious health issue ( she thought she might lose her sight ) . She said these did the trick wonderfully . She carried a bar in her purse to every doctor 's appointment and fortified herself with creamy goodness before every painful procedure . She told me that the only way she could cope with the laser surgeries and having needles inserted into her eyes was knowing that she could eat a whole bar of this chocolate when it was over . That 's some powerful chocolate ! Thankfully , her last appointment showed no more problems with her retina and the doctor said she should recover fully with no permanent lose of vision . She said she 's going to use some of the remaining bars in baking cookies . She thinks the creamy almost caramel-like taste will be wonderful in chocolate chunk cookies . Hope she sends me some .	1
This truly lives up to its name as the worlds best milk chocolate I have ever tasted . And this is the best deal I have found on line .	1
A delicious milk chocolate , much smoother than the regular Hershey 's . Will definitely purchase again , even nicer when put in the freezer for awhile .	1
We give our dogs brewer 's yeast at each meal . We had switched them to an all natural flea and tick product because I was tired of dumping poison on them . I read that brewer 's yeast is also good for repelling fleas , so I added that to their meals as a supplement to the all natural product . We are on our second month and so far , so good . It 's less expensive than the old treatment !	1
The bottle arrived today and I immediately opened it . Naturally both dogs were sure what EVER it was , was for them . This time they were correct.My main goal today was to see if they would EAT one . My little female ( MiniPoodle mix ) is VERY fussy , sniffs and tastes everything before she agrees to chew it . She gobbled the tablet right down . That was the signal for the male ( MiniPoodle ) that it 's good stuff , so he too snarfed it down.We have passed the taste test and I will use these as `` treats '' ... ... .now if they work -- -I will be thrilled and delighted . I have high hopes as everyone I have talked with says they do ... and I REFUSE to use another flea chemical product of any kind on my `` kids '' ... as I truly believe the `` spot-on '' type drops were the single contributing factor to the beginning symptoms of seizures ! Here 's hoping ! UPDATE 3/20/2013We are flea free -- true it is n't the REAL flea season yet -- but we have had some MAJOR hot days - I have to admit I saw one DEAD flea on Leo-the white poodle -- that was it !	1
This is a good price . I have never had a problem with leas . This could be for some other reason or it could be in oart because of these brewers yeast pills . Since everything is working well , i will continue to use them	1
I purchased these for my King Charles Cavalier . He loves the taste and we use them as treats after he comes inside . No fleas yet ~ but we have only been using them a week . I was concerned about enticing him to consume these ... no worries there !	1
I have two Maltese dogs and was at my wits end when I found this product . The people behind me had brought in two puppies , covered with ticks , and promptly shared them with the entire neighborhood . Nocturnal visits by cats , plus several squirrels running around in my yard , brought in fleas , and I could NOT get rid of them . Maltese dogs have really long , thick hair and my poor little dogs were just miserable . I had to have all their hair cut off ( which I usually do in the summer ) in the early spring , while it was still very cold at night and in the morning . And I STILL could n't get rid of the fleas and ticks . My male dog is allergic to Advantix and Frontline did n't even slow the ticks down . So I was looking for some other kind of help when I found this product . I had heard some people say it worked and others said it did n't , but I decided it was worth a try and I 'm really glad I tried it . It does n't get rid of every flea or tick on my dogs , but , where I was finding a bunch of fleas and picking ticks off my dogs by the dozens , every day , I am now finding an occasional flea and maybe one or two ticks on my dogs every day . My little girl dog is a big eater and she loves to eat her pill . My finicky-eater boy has to have his crushed and dropped into his mouth . Once it 's there , he likes it pretty well and will go ahead and swallow it . Bottom line : it worked pretty well for my dogs and there is no garlic smell that I can detect . I think it was well worth the money .	1
does what is to do , hair is soft [ long hair ] no more dry skin , itching etc . so buy if you have a fuzzy person , they will say thanks if they could~	1
But a great value for the 1000-countFix item . 'Size ' atop page reads '100-count ' yet Product DescriptionSize : 100-CountBrewers Yeast Tablets w/Garlic-1000 ct	1
I 've no idea if this really repels ticks and fleas as I also started my cats onVet 's Best Natural Flea + Tick Home Spray , 32 ozat the same time so ca n't tell if these are effective by themselves.However , my cats LOVE them . I shake the bottle and they come running . So they 're a popular `` treat '' that I feel good giving them as they 're quite nutritious .	1
Brewers yeast with garlic is great for your dog or cat . It helps keep fleas from being as bad as they could be . You would still need to treat the pet for fleas using some other method . Also , garlic is a homeopathic cure for internal parasites , namely worms . My dog was having recurring problems catching worms until I started giving her the Brewers yeast with garlic . She loves them too . Most dogs and cats love brewers yeast . If the pet does n't want to take the first one you can put it in their mouth . That 's usually all it takes to get them to like them . I 've had that experience with about 4 of the cats I 've had in the past . After the initial force feeding of the pill , my cats would almost fight each other over them and saw them as treats . : )	1
My cats really like these . I give it to them as treats , one a day mixed with their other crunchy treats . However , I have bought this same brand many times and the tablets vary slightly in smell ( maybe taste ? ) , color and texture , batch to batch . But my cats eat it up nonetheless . To make it easier for my cats to eat , I usually break each tablet in two , just with my hands.Also , it really does help keep the fleas away ... .no problems here . And if you combine this with diatomaceous earth- this is the one I 've used before- http : //amzn.to/1kTS2VE then they should be flea resistant . The fleas wo n't stand a chance .	1
I bought this supplement for our three labradoodles to use as a natural flea and tick control . One of our pups was diagnosed with epilepsy and the topical ( and oral ) flea/tick meds we were giving were triggering seizures . I ca n't attest that the product controls fleas and ticks yet , but I will say that our picky doodles all LOVE these pills which is a good start . They do n't like most liver flavored pills . Hopefully , the intended purpose will also be true .	1
We have one dog and two cats , and they love these tablets . They gobble them up like treats . Just subjective , but I think they work well to repel fleas .	1
will use again when we run out ... .works wonders for fleas in dogs ! ! ! ! does not hurt their system at all ! ! ! ! love this ! !	1
Well.. 1 out of 3 of my cats will eat these . When they first arrived 2 of them would eat them . We'v only had them for a little more then a week . The scratching on the one that eats them has ceased however he is n't the one with the skin allergies so I have to look for another product to try.. I did try several tricks to get them to eat them but they we 're on to me and simply ate around the tabs.. O well..	1
My dogs love these pills ! One of my dogs continually had red patches on his hind legs and since I 've started him on these , those patches have almost completely disappeared . Furthermore , my dogs no longer pick up fleas from being outside . I will continue to buy them especially since they are much less expensive and safer than those other vet pills .	1
My rough collie loves them , and she is the pickiest eater I 've ever seen . Half the treats I buy she wo n't touch , so I was skeptical about giving her brewers yeast no matter how good for her it might be . Needless to say I was amazed that she likes these tablets more than any of her other treats . Collies can be prone to skin problems and allergies to fleas , in fact we had to put a big male collie when I was young who lost half his hair to hot spots.Since my collie can get infested with fleas because of the matting of her undercoat ( which happens on a daily basis ) , I 've been looking for something besides the flea drops that make her lethargic for a day after I apply them . She does n't have any fleas at the moment and now I 'm hoping to keep her that way with brewers yeast . So far , so good . Unfortunately , the cat does n't like them , so she 'll be getting the back-of-the neck drops.I feed my 55 lb . collie about 5-10 tablets almost every day . They make very convenient treats and they 're small enough for one bite . It 's been a few weeks now and her coat looks terrific , but then it alway does . I 'm going to keep feeding her brewer 's yeast for the rest of her life and hopefully , we 'll stay flea-free .	1
Both my dogs and my cats think these are treats . I do n't know if they help with fleas or not since I use other flea meds , but it 's good for them regardless . All of my animals seem to like them , and even if they did n't , the pills are soft enough to break up easily and mix into food .	1
Who knows ... My cat loves them as treats , and they 're good as a nutritional supplement . Do they help with fleas ? That 's hard to say . This year was the worst in recent memory & I do n't use only these . I 'll keep giving them to her as a supplement , regardless .	1
I bought this product to keep my dog free from parasites , fleas ticks etc.It seems to work quite well since he has not had any buggies on him all summer . Last month after a walk in the woods I came back and a tick fell on my lap , it did not stay on my boy , that is what I want . I live in the woods and bugs are a problem or should I say they were a problem.Giving this is not hard my dog loves them I do not have to crush them to give them I just have to shake the container and wherever he is he comes running.Because of this product I no longer need to use those awful drops you must put on their backs to repel bugs , this is a safer better way to keep your pets bug free.UPDATE : If your pet has any yeast infections going on stay away from this product . Some claim it helps with yeast but as I found out just recently yeast is yeast and all yeast may cause yeast infections in sensitive dogs . Like mine . I can no longer use this product , they claim on the label it hels with skin problems and since yeast causes skin problems I assumed this would hlep , It does not it makes it worse .	1
I started eating these as a kid and I still love them . I am not Asain , but I like foods from all over the world . These candies have a little rice paper edible wrapper . While the toys moved to stickers now the candy is still really good . It has a unique flavor and I just can not get enough of these . They are pretty wholesome for candy . They really are a special treat . I think they are healthier than other candies . I am not sure what American kids of today would think , but if they are not used to total junk I think they would like them . These are really special . The taste is really light . They are chewy and sticky so you would not want to give them to really little kids for risk of choaking . I do think they would be healthier than other things and might be nice for a holiday special gift or other special occasion for an older child . Someone who is age 5 and up would be perfect .	1
Ordered these to try and loved them . Could eat the wrapper that they came in . Me and my kids had a good time just eating them for the first time . I would recommend them if you want to try a new kind of candy that is sweet but not too sweet .	1
Fun	1
At first , the word 'rice candy ' did n't sound very appetizing . However , one bite and I was in love ! They are little chewy pieces of translucent pink candy wrapped in an inner edible rice paper . What I like best about them is that they are n't too sweet , which is typical of most Asian confections . It 's a little pricey for the 6 little pieces you get inside the box but who puts a price on favourite foods ?	1
i thought it was going to be bigger but it has 6 pieces they were so soft and chewy and melted in my mouth	1
These are by far thee best organic cookies out there ! ! ! And not too high calorie for 10 of them per serving ! !	1
This cookie is the same chocolate cookie that is in their Newman O 's . If you like chocolate cookies these are the best . I use them for a chocolate crust in my cheesecakes.Great cookie , profits go to charity and organic so they are as pesticide free as possible and grown by sustainable methods .	1
I have fallen in love with these cookies ! They taste almost the same as Newman 's sandwich cookies , just without the filling . Crunchy , chocolaty , and just the perfect size . And at 120 calories for a serving , they are n't too waist enhancing.The main reason I am in love with them is the fact that they do n't have any corn in them ( I 'm allergic to corn ) . This is something that not too many cookie makers consider when making their products.Yet another Newman 's Own product to add to our ever growing pantry of products.Pros : Chocolaty enough to satisfy chocoholics.Crunchy and have a good texture.Cons : Far too many Qs and not enough vowels , it 's like playing Scrabble ! : P	1
MY FAVORITE COOKIES ! I love Oreos without the cream and these are perfect . They taste just like the ice-box cake cookies sold in the larger flat cookies , too ... . BUT ... ..I need to know exactly what `` natural flavoring '' is because I react horribly to MSG and similar glutamate heavy `` altered 'natural ' foods '' that are allowed by the FDA . I am trying to eliminate even small amounts from my diet to prevent future effects that build up with the trace amounts you get in each item . The FDA allows many flavor enhancing trace chemicals that have the same effects as glutamates on people ... . but they do n't have to specifically list them and it leaves me in a tough spot for enjoying packaged foods : ( I ca n't wait to start chomping these again ! ! : )	1
These are a great lunch box snack . Just enough sweetness and no high fructose corn syrup or hydrogenated oils which is great if you care what you are eating as well . Too bad they have reduced the package size and increased the price like every other food company out there .	1
After googling these and seeing that some people are obsessed with the arrowroot variety , I thought I would give them a try . They taste basically like graham crackers or maybe animal crackers with strong taste of honey . It 's great that they have no trans fats , minimal chemical ingredients , are mostly organic , and `` non-profit '' ; but they 're nothing to get excited about . The hard texture is a pro/con in that it forces you to eat carefully , and limits your desire to gorge . These are good non-lethal commercial cookies , but like all commerical cookies are lacking in nutrition and taste .	1
I have purchased these cookies twice now ( I 'm backlogged , but I was afraid that Amazon would n't stock them again ) and I 'm slowly eating my way through them.Many people have attempted to describe the taste and I agree with most of the previous descriptions - they are not hyper sweet or milk chocolate-y , but rather almost like a darker chocolate taste . Do n't take me calling it dark chocolate to mean they 're bitter , because they 're not , but imagine the taste of a normal Hershey 's bar if you removed half the sugar . You 'd still get the nice taste of chocolate , but just in a more subdued fashion . If you have a chocolate craving , and not a sugar craving , you 'll love these cookies . If you have just a simple sweet tooth and a craving for sugar , well these may not be quite what you 're looking for.One thing to keep in mind is that these are what I would classify as `` very hard '' cookies . Most of the cookies you find on the grocery stores now days contain quite a few fatty ingredients that make the cookie yield in your mouth instead of crunching . These suckers crunch . A lot . I would even go far as to say that if you have dental issues , milk would be a requirement to eat these . The texture is very similar to eating Nature 's Valley granola bars ( not the chewy ones ) .	1
These Ginger-O 's are delicious ! Great ginger flavor , great texture and crunch , good filling . Arrived very fresh and undamaged . Absolutely yummy ! These are a new favorite of mine now and it 's very hard to only eat a couple . ; ) Definitely recommend these if you like ginger snaps or similar cookies.My son says `` Better than & lt ; those other O 's > '' and I agree .	1
I love these wheat free Newman O 's ! Not quite as good as Oreos or regular Newman O 's but they are really good . If you have kids on a wheat free diet these will make them very happy indeed ! Amazon has these at a very good price with Subscribe & Save . These are hard to find and Whole Foods charges a lot more .	1
These cookies are amazing . I bought them because of the small list of pure ingredients in these cookies . They are also amazing and go great with milk . The ginger is also not overwhelming , which I love .	1
I have a wheat allergy . These cookies are great . They do not taste just like oreos as they are wheat free and also not full of processed junk . Those looking for a healthier oreo but do not have to have a wheat allergy should look elsewhere . Those with an allergy will find that these cookies are pretty tasty . I have tried many wheat free oreos out there and these are the best that I have found	1
Contrary to other reviews Newman O 's are better than Oreo 's . Every person that I 've given them to has thought they are better ( I lie and say they are an improved Oreo ) . What 's more I think they are more like Oreo 's used to be when I was a kid , I do n't remember them having hydrogenated oil or being disgusted eating the filling as I am now.The bottom line is the cookie is exactly the same and the creme filling is the same minus the Crisco shortening.Why buy them ? They taste better , they have NO transfats or Fructose ( just good old sucrose ) , profits go to charity , and they are organic ( which means they have little or no pesticides and are grown by sustainable methods )	1
I originally purchased these for my daughter who is wheat free ( among other things ) . I noticed that I was having to purchase them more frequently so I put them on the Subscribe and Save . That was very convenient . Later I realized why they were going so quickly , when I saw my husband and little boy each had a handful . I asked my husband if he realized they where wheat free he said yes but that they were still good . My daughter gets mad when they eat `` her '' cookies but since they were coming regularly she has learned to share.The cookie part is very crunchy ( more so than Oreos ) and has a nice chocolaty taste . The creme filling tastes just like oreos to me.Unfortunately , Amazon just took them off subscribe and save . I 'm so not happy about that !	1
I know . . I 'm reviewing the product here - its terrific ! Costs nearly $ 5 in stores here and worth every penny from Amazon.My only gripe is that it took forever for these to arrive and when they did they were pretty battered and many of the cookies inside the box are broken up . I love having my kids eat these instead of Oreo 's etc but they do n't seem to go for broken cookies . Go figure.Anyway , the cookies are great , Love Paul Newman but if you are n't prepared for some broken ginger o 's you 're better off picking them up in a store	1
In this multi-level analysis of Newman-O 's vs. Oreos , we consider three areas : Taste , Values , and Nutrition ( as always , consult a physician or other professional about nutritional concerns ) .1 ) Taste . A Draw -- Newman-O 's for adults/Oreos for kids : Nutritional considerations aside , Kraft ( which owns Nabisco ) Oreos have the advantage of more sugar and a familiarity that does not bring contempt . Newman 's have a more `` mature '' taste , heavier on the cocoa side with hints of dark chocolate , and not as sweet as Oreos . Newman-O 's , however , are somewhat of an acquire d taste : At first I did n't like them , then began to appreciate the more subtle cocoa flavors . My hunch , though , is that kids will prefer Oreos.2 ) Values . Newman 1 , Kraft 0 ( maybe even -1 ) : Threatened by a lawsuit and federal truth-in-labeling regulations , Kraft finally removed the trans fat ( probably the worst kind of fat ) from Oreos in 2006 , even though a company spokesperson once said this would be `` difficult , '' and that trans fat availability should be left to nutritionists , not to legislators or the courts . ( Perhaps Oreos are `` red state '' cookies , and Newman 's are for `` blue staters ? '' ) Before legislation requiring labeling of any trans fat of half a gram or more , Kraft did not list it ; Newman ) 's never had it.Newman 's , as always , donates all after-tax profits to charity ; Kraft donates an unknown amount , because they do n't publicize it , and because you can bet the CEO 's stock options that they 're not donating all of it . While I do n't want to get too political here , Newman 's uses a number of organic ingredients , and organic food proponents cite the resulting health and environmental benefits.3 ) Nutrition . Advantage , Newman-O 's , but 2 cookies or 3 ? It turns out that nutritional information for Oreos is based on a 34 gram , three cookie serving size ; Newman-O 's uses a 28 gram , 2 cookie serving size . As shown below , the 2 cookie serving size outclasses Oreos on having more of the good and less of the bad . One could argue , however , that this is an unfair comparison , because a serving size of Newman-0 's is % smaller than that for Oreos . ( Although one could also argue that Newman 's supports `` portion control . '' However , if your portion control is n't controlled and you have 3 Newman-O 's , the nutritional edge decreases . Still , even 3 Newman 's ( compared to 3 Oreos ) gives you 3.57 % less total fat , and less sodium . However , you 'll consume 11 % more saturated fat , more carbohydrates ( 47.25 grams to 25 for 3 Oreos ) , more calories ( 195 to 160 ) . Some people may also prefer Newman-O 's wheat-free ingredients and use of sweeteners , rather than the often maligned high-fructose corn syrup found in Kraft Oreos.The Verdict . A great Paul Newman movie ! Oh , and if I have to choose , I 'd say at least try the Newman-O 's . You ( the adult , but perhaps not your kids ) may like the taste better than Oreos , and the 2 cookie serving size handily beats the 3 serving-size of Oreos on total and saturated fat , sugar , calories , and sodium ( as well as containng more organic ingredients ) . At three cookies each , the difference begin to disappear , though with Newman-O 's you satisfy not your appetite for cookies , but your hunger for helping people in need . I know , it sounds touchy-feely , but it 's true.Ingredients -- Kraft Regular Oreos : SUGAR , ENRICHED FLOUR ( WHEAT FLOUR , NIACIN , REDUCED IRON , THIAMINE MONONITRATE [ VITAMIN B1 ] , RIBOFLAVIN [ VITAMIN B2 ] , FOLIC ACID ) , HIGH OLEIC CANOLA OIL AND/OR PALM OIL AND/OR CANOLA OIL , COCOA ( PROCESSED WITH ALKALI ) , HIGH FRUCTOSE CORN SYRUP , BAKING SODA , CORNSTARCH , SALT , SOY LECITHIN ( EMULSIFIER ) , VANILLIN-AN ARTIFICIAL FLAVOR , CHOCOLATE.OREOS , Nutritional Information . 3 cookies ( 34 grams ) : Total fat ( 7 grams ) , Saturated fat ( 2 g ) .

It may be true that organic food , especially snacks , are more expensive than processed ones , but Newman-O 's taste pretty awesome . The flavor is practically indistinguishable from Mint Oreo 's and are very reminiscent of Girl Scout Thin Mint cookies , so if you 're willing to fork over the extra money for an organic Mint Oreo , then go for it ! The flavor really does n't disappoint !	1
These are the best `` oreo-type '' sandwich cookies in the world , of any brand or cost , including oreo . They have the best cookie and cream . These are even better than Trader Joe 's `` Joe 's O 's '' and I am a diehard Trader Joe 's shopper.These gluten people have gotten a bit out of hand . The rating of a product should be on its quality , either short-term utility or long-term durability . The product clearly states that it contains wheat and nowhere does it state it is gluten-free . The problem with Amazon searches is that it will include customer-created tags in its search results , which can cause problems in situations like this . If you are one of the 1 % of people who have Celiac 's disease , then you should probably investigate the product fully , especially if you are one of those people where even `` shared equipment '' can cause extreme reactions.Newman 's Organics is a great company - socially responsible , environmentally friendly , well-sourced ingredients , and gives profits back to the planet . They are certainly not deceitful or out to hurt the incredibly tiny percentage of people who have Celiac 's disease .	1
This is one of my favorite indulgences from one of my favorite companies . These are better than the name brand originator of the sandwich , and well worth the price . Convenience of Amazon subscription helps a bit , as does the discounted price and home delivery . This item light just be the best of its kind ... I ca n't think of any other that tastes as good ... I like to eat them slowly and savor all the flavor . But be careful ... watching an engrossing movie at the same time might cause you to eat the whole pack without realizing how many you 've consumed ... until you reach for another and they 're all gone . ; - )	1
When we discovered Newman-O 's a few weeks back , we were happy to find a healthier version of Oreos . Oreos contain high fructose corn syrup , which my husband simply can not tolerate , so many packaged cookies have been off of our list for awhile . But , Newman-O 's have saved the day ! PROS : - Taste great ! - Crunchy cookie that has a great chocolate flavor.- Sweet creamy center with exceptionally smooth cream.- Great dunked in milk.- No high fructose corn syrup.- Contains organic ingredients , and nothing artificial ( big plus , there ) .- Do n't crumble easily , cookies are mostly whole in the packaging tray.CONS : - Bag is n't resealable , so cookies must be placed into another bag or container to prevent staleness.- Taste too good , serving size is too small ! We love Newman-O 's . They taste great and are better for the body than Oreo 's or any other knock-off store brand .	1
But ... then I found chocolate peanut butter Newman-O 's and everything was right with the world again ... in terms of cookie satisfaction , that is.I prefer to pull two of them apart , eating the two naked cookie halves - then smash the two halves w/peanut butter together to make a `` double stuff '' Newman-O . In my humble opinion there is no finer store-bought cookie enjoyment experience available on Earth at the current time.This is what you wave under my nose to make sure I 'm REALLY dead .	1
Love this Teas . Relaxing to your senses , leaves a nice taste in your mouth and you can drink it in the evenings without worry .	1
Looking for a tea that is light but not fruity ? This is a great minty tea without being too well ... minty ... if you know what I mean . Perfect for after work or a busy day . Good hot or cold , I prefer hot tea all year but have used a tea bag in with the Typhoo black tea to make iced tea . No cream or sugar needed .	1
Ordered this bag tea as something to take to work . Normally use loose leaf tea , but this is very good .	1
A few weeks ago one of my friends made me a cup of tea . I really like it . I was sick and it help clear me out . Highly suggested .	1
Tazo 's `` Refresh '' tea definitely lives up to its name . The tea is caffeine-free , which is great for those of us who get jittery after just a little bit of caffeine . It contains peppermint , spearmint , and tarragon , which leave a pleasant , refreshing aftertaste in your mouth . I love this tea hot on a chilly winter day , but it 's also great iced . Definitely my favorite Tazo tea , and one of the most versatile.Overall , I highly recommend Tazo `` Refresh '' tea for anyone looking for a fresh , minty tea . This is sure to become a household favorite .	1
I make a wonderful hot breakfast cereal with amaranth , a chopped apple , milk , cinnamon and a little stevia . Just remember that if you want salt in your recipe , do n't add it until the amaranth is done cooking . Salt inhibits the grains from softening .	1
I love Amaranth and have ordered this more than once . Makes a good hot cereal on a cold morning . This seems to be a good brand .	1
At some point I would like to try TeffBob 's Red Mill Whole Grain Teff , 24-Ounce Packages ( Pack of 4 ) I eat lots of Brown Rice & Quinoa I putRoland Tahini Pure Ground Sesame Seed , 32-Ounce Container ( Pack of 2 ) on it withReese Artichoke Bottoms , 14-Ounce Cans ( Pack of 12 ) Carrots & Lettuce YUMMMMMAmaranth is more Woodys smell but I Like it now ! Have n't gotten to a point where I have it for breakfast ...	1
If you have used amaranth before , all you need to know is that this is good quality clean amaranth . Buy it if price suits you.If you have never used amaranth before , be aware these are very very tiny seeds . When you cook them they form a sort of crunchy paste . Sort of an amaranth polenta ... Very subtle flavor.Not my favorite grain but I kinda liked it when cooked for ten minutes at pressure in pressure cooker with equal amount millet and couple whole medium large unpeeled white potatoes . I cook my grains in stainless bowl that sets inside the pressure cooker on the rack . This keeps such things from scorching or sticking to bottom of cooker and makes clean up much easier since nothing sticks to cooker itself . You just remove the stainless bowl to wash it . The steam in the pressure cooker really fluffs up grains . By way , best method to cook rice ! You need like inch water in bottom of cooker , then in the bowl , cup and half of water per cup of grain ( or beans ) . So in this case three cups water to the one cup millet and one cup amaranth . Cook at 15psi for ten minutes . When cooking done and pressure naturally released , mash up potatoes with fork and stir everything together with a measure of olive oil and bit salt or your favorite spices , garlic , diced veggies etc . Serve hot . The potato and millet keeps the amaranth from being just lump of crunchy paste . IMHO potato flavor also goes very well with grains and/or beans .	1
I thought I was getting amaranth flour . It is still in grain form so you have to find a way to grind it . I do not know for sure if this is something I like . The flavor is a bit strong for me . So I am not sure if I am just cooking with it the wrong way .	1
For those into natural foods , it is okay . We use it sometimes as hot cereal , but moreso in salads . We think it has a nice somewhat nutty flavor . It is filling . It 's not particularly cheap , but a little goes a long way .	1
Trying to turn our diet into a healthier way of eating , so tried this ... have to learn more ways to use but so far so good	1
This seed required much dedication from me before I changed my rating from three stars to five stars , but I am so happy that I did . I always look for healthy foods and consume many unconventional food items that offer nutrients and micro-nutrients . Organic sesame seed was becoming hard to find . On my search for calcium , I came across amaranth . It was a flop with me at first but with many nutrients , price , gluten free , grown in US organically , available all the time , I tried till I got it the way I wanted to get the taste and the nutrients which has been a great addition to my diet.Quinoa is the beef for vegans and nothing matches the complete protein of quinoa , and I mean nothing . Amaranth is half the cost of quinoa but only in comparison to yellow one . Red quinoa is almost three times more than amaranth . Amaranth has high amounts of minerals , such as calcium , iron , magnesium and phosphorus where quinoa contains more vitamin E but does not match the overall vitamin and mineral profile of amaranth . In one cup of cooked , calories 251 vs. 222 , protein 19 % vs. 16 % , calcium 12 vs. 3 ( unbelievable since sesame seed has fat and Amaranth zero for the calcium ) , iron 29 % vs. 15 % ( unbelievable again ) ... Lima beans offers accordingly 229 , 29 % ( not a complete protein ) , 5 % and 24 % but none comes close to fiber of lima , a whopping 56 % ... Quinoa is a milder taste grain cooks in ten minutes , no more no less , ready for me on the spot , whenever I wish , with no hassle , with great taste but amaranth takes longer , and I mean really , really longer so it is completely a different process . Amaranth is like okra , slimy , darker color and harder to prepare so I have no idea how some of those reviewers claim they prepare and have it for breakfast since it will not be ready for breakfast . I never soak quinoa but with amaranth , I treat it just like a bean.I consume amaranth buy preparing differently depending to how much time I like to spend ; 1 . As raw food for the highest amount nutrients which means no applied heat , I ground it with flax and sesame seed in coffee grinder for my power drinks . Nine tbsp which is some 100gr of these beauties offer me 16 % calcium and 62 % magnesium with that needed 24mg of Phytosterols for lowering cholesterol.2 . I roast with RPO for less saturated fat and more EFAs , and sometimes with EVCO but never with my favorite EVOO since it does not complement the taste . I use the same process as I pop popcorn.3 . For meals , I soak in advance in a 16qt sauce pan for a day . I drain the water and rinse . Cook for thirty minutes which gets it slimy enough then add all other food ingredients to the mix . That process requires more water and oil . I cook the mix just like I would with okra with the difference that fresh okra is hard to find.Sesame seed is a priority to me but it lacks protein where quinoa makes up for it . Amaranth vs. sesame is 88 % - % 62 % = % 24 less magnesium in 100 gram and less of many other nutrients than sesame but the catch is 573-371=202 less calories , 35 % -7 % =28 % less saturated fat than sesame at half the cost of yellow and third cost of black sesame .	1
I ordered this grain because I am following the Ultra Metabolism 21 day detox phase ... ok , stop the eye rolling . It 's basically about removing potential allergens ( diary , etc . ) and cleansing yourself from processed foods -any sugar , hydrogenated oils , white flour ... and although I dont eat that stuff in general , it 's amazing how many `` all natural '' foods have high fructose corn syrup ( many Marie 's dressings , etc . ) Anywho- my amaranth arrived quickly but one bag had burst open - the packaging was a joke ! Amazon shrinkwraps books so they sre sealed air-tight , yet bags of grain soar freely in their big Amazon box , begging to explode.The other bags remained in tact - the stench from the grain takes getting used to . It smells swampy to me , but my sister says that 's just `` earthy . `` It 's a complete grain and it cooks up nicely as a hot cereal - and it pops like popcorn , too .	1
I purchased Amaranth because of the health benefits . Unlike the majority of people who use this in place of rice or in baking , I purchased it to make popcorn and it 's yummy . Make sure you do NOT use a non stick pan . Make sure it is very HOT before placing 1 TBS of Amaranth in the pan . If it does n't pop immediately your pan is n't hot enough . Immediately remove your pan from the stove and shake shake shake so it does n't burn . Very tasty treat . Keep in mind alot of the seeds wo n't pop but they are still very tasty .	1
I really have n't had it but once , but it is supposed to help with osteoporosis . Time will tell how this product is working .	1
I 've been eating a palmful in the morning , and again at night . I just love crunching them between my teeth ! It 's like it 's a treat or something ... lol . Anyway , they are fresh and they taste good . I 've noticed my skin has improved dramatically since I started eating them . My fine lines are barely there , no dry patches now , and I have a dewy glow . Since I hate any type of seafood and omega 3 capsules make me break out , this is my only way of getting that healthy fatty acid . I dare say my energy is better as well . I will definetly keep buying these .	1
This is great for baking or mixing with oatmeal/pancakes , and other ingredients such as flour . Hope this helps for suggestions .	1
I use these and use a coffee grinder to blend them up and use them in the yogurt along with my own fruit thatI blend up as they are recommended in Dr. Budwig . Thanks for having them available Amazon .	1
Like it !	1
Super product , love it . Packaged well , fresh , well priced , quickly shipped . Everyone knows the benefits of flax seed . Grind it and use it quickly though ; do n't grind up the entire package and let it sit . Grind only what you 'll use that meal . Good luck !	1
Flax seed has so many health benefits . This is a great price for them . Store them in the refrigerator to keep them fresh .	1
This was a good purchase for us , because we chew flax seeds as a snack . Usually the seeds are dried out . This product was soft , so the seeds were freshly harvested . Really nice flavor .	1
This is a great product , at a good price , with unbeatable convenience . I grind it and add it to my morning smoothy , and let the extra fiber do it 's thing .	1
Not sure what to say about seeds other than they work well and are good for you . I use these with morning breakfast drinks of fruits , vegetables , seeds etc .	1
This product is a great price for this organic version . It is much more expensive in most natural product stores .	1
I use flax seed in my smoothies , pancakes , and cake baking ( yes I lie to my self that this makes it healthy )	1
I get this all the time at the store and sprinkle them in my yogurt , protein shakes , on ice cream and in my omelets . They are a good source of fiber and other nutrients . I would suggest them for anyone .	1
packaging and delivery very good . I 've been using flax seed for years highly recommed to every one to try . I buy by price and quality . This one is very fresh .	1
I 've been drinking this for a few years now , its the only decaf tea I really enjoy . The vanilla flavor is not overpowering , its just enough to bring some sweetness without having to add sweetener.I drink it straight .	1
I decided to try rooibos after reading about what a good detoxifier it is . Since it is caffeine-free , I gave my kids a taste . I was n't expecting them to like it as they normally only like peppermint and fruit-flavored teas . However , they LOVED this Vanilla Rooibos tea . Highly recommended !	1
Despite a foray into peppermint and chamomile tea as a youth ( following my father 's lead ) , I 've never been an avid hot tea drinker . I read about this tea in Best Life magazine and decided to give it a try for the claimed health benefits of rooibos tea . Healthy or not , this tea is delicious . I drink at least two cups a day , plus a Thermos-ful at work . I prefer it with a shot ofMadhava Pure Organic Raw Agave Nectar . It would be nice if I could get a caffeinated version , but I guess I 'll have to stick toLipton Black Pearl Teafor that .	1
Red Rooibus is high in anti-oxidants and is a very smooth good tasting tea . I was looking for an alternative to green tea ( which I do not like ) the vanilla is a bonus . This is equal too The Republic of Tea 's version & # 34 ; Good Hope Vanilla & # 34 ; and is much cheaper . When I purchased this , I thought the grocery store had discontinued it ( it 's back ) If you have to get it on-line , It is worth it if you buy the 3-pk	1
I have loved tea ever since I was a little girl , and I can honestly say that Celestial Seasonings has been one of my favorite whimsical brands of teas supporting my habit of drinking this healthful and delicious brew . I do n't know anyone who can resist the cozy boxes with cheery , charming artwork pleasing to the eye , all printed on 100 % recycled cardboard , with the tea bags being large and very plain as their taste once dropped in the hot water is worth the bag looking the way it does while the cover art on the box really make this a better tea than some of the brand out there in their fancy boxes and shiny labels , that taste flat and bitter.Madagascar Vanilla Red is a caffeine free blend of Rooibos , Natural French Vanilla Flavor and Vanilla bean . When sugar or honey or even milk are added it tastes like the sweetest , almost chewy vanilla one can sink their teeth into whenever a sweet craving kicks in . I swear it reminds me of the Madagascar Vanilla I use in all my baking for the intense and heady sweet aroma and it tastes like a bakery treaty in a cup and since it 's healthy , easy to find and inexpensive it makes me a very satisfied customer . If I drink it plain , no sugar no nothing it tastes like a delicate exotic tea with a breath of sweetness , and this is one of the very few teas I can drink plain , quite a feat in my eyes.I heartily recommend it for any tea fan , even if they do n't think that Herbal/Caffeine type teas are their cup of tea , haha , this is better because its not decaf , its naturally caffeine free , omitting the artificial process and it simply makes me happy when I drink it .	1
Ah , it 's a definitely American story - in 1969 friends Mo Siegel and Wyck Hay of Colorado began selling the herbal teas that they had previously only made for themselves . From such small beginnings came that famous tea company - Celestial Seasonings.Among Celestial Seasonings ' many products is an absolutely wonderful , naturally decaffeinated herbal infusion - Madagascar Vanilla Red . This tea is based on South African red tea , made with rooibos ( pronounced `` roy-boss '' ) leaves , and includes delicious Madagascar vanilla . It tastes great either hot or iced - deliciously vanilla-filled , with a nutty subtaste that makes this tea a great way to end the evening.By the way , I have found that the best way to drink this tea is hot , with sugar and milk , accompanied by fresh-out-of-the-oven chocolate chip cookies . Mmm Mmm Good !	1
I was pleasantly surprised by this rich flavorful tea . Some vanilla teas are thin and sickly in flavor -- not this one ! Celestial Seasoning has managed to make a sweet -- not cloying -- rich tea mixture that brews up to a fragrant , comforting and enjoyable cup of tea -- I add cream to round out the flavor.Rooibos is the base for this tea . It is a healthy alternative to black teas because it is naturally caffeine-free and loaded with antioxidants -- as much as green tea . You can brew this tea for a long time and it will not get bitter because there are no tannins.Celestial Seasonings gets extra points for their packaging : they utilize 100 % natural recycled paperboard in their boxes and they do n't package each tea bag individually . Instead they use a system of a waxed paper bag inside the box that stays shut when you fold it . It keeps the bags fresh and utilizes less packaging than individually wrapping each bag . The art they use on each box is beautiful as are the quotes and information they put on every surface .	1
Celestial Seasonings Madagascar Vanilla Red is a nice mellow tea with smooth vanilla taste . I have n't seen this in my local market so I purchased here in Amazon . Was it worth the extra cost ? For me , vanilla is one of my favorite flavors so the answer is yes . I found that I do not need to add any honey because of the naturally sweet flavor and I do not have to add cream because it is not bitter . I 'm giving this tea four stars because it is a bit more mild then I would prefer , even if you steep it for a long time . Still a wonderful tea worth trying.What is Rooibos ? Rooibos ( Anglicized pronunciation : / & # 712 ; r & # 596 ; & # 618 ; b & # 594 ; s/ roy-bos ; Afrikaans pronunciation : [ r & # 596 ; & # 720 ; ib & # 596 ; s ] , meaning `` red bush '' ; scientific name Asrpalathus linearis ) is a broom-like member of the legume family of plants growing in South Africa 's fynbos.The generic name comes from the plant Calicotome villosa , aspalathos in Greek . This plant has very similar growth and flowers to the Rooibos plant . The specific name linearis comes from the plant 's linear growing structure and needle-like leaves.The leaves are used to make an herbal tea called Rooibos , bush tea ( esp . Southern Africa ) , or simply rooibos . The product has been popular in Southern Africa for generations and is now consumed in many countries . It is sometimes spelled rooibosch in accordance with the old Dutch etymology.elestial Seasonings Madagascar Vanilla Red ( from Wikipedia ) Whaf is rooibos ?	1
ARRIVED LATE BY THE TIME IT ARRIVED I WAS ALREADY OVER MY COLD . THE CANDIES THEMSELVES TRULY ARE NOT CANDIES BUT THEY ARE SWEET AND THEY ALLEVIATE SORE THROAT FOR A TIME . MY HUSBAND WOULD EVEN EAT THESE WHEN HE IS NOT SICK ... IF YOU DO N'T HAVE MINTS YOU CAN SUCK ON ONE OF THESE TO FRESHEN YOUR BREATH . THEY ARE FIRM AND CHEWY ENOUGH TO LAST A WHILE IN YOUR MOUTH .	1
I only buy these once in a while , but that 's because I ca n't stop eating them when I get them !	1
a great candy , altho it was a bit too spicy for my tastes . Some reviewers mentioned they were tough to get out of the wrapper , they 've started wrapping them with an edible rice paper wrapper first , then the usual wrapper . I did n't have trouble with them sticking at all .	1
I 've been enjoying the Ting Ting Jahe for years and nothing else satisfies me like the real thing . Others are to soft or too hard , too rich or too weak , too spicy or not enough , too expensive or questionable because they cost so little . I 'm fortunate to have these sold in a market within walking distance so I never have to be without . The rice paper melts in the mouth as I chew the perfect texture which contains the perfect ginger heat that satisfies alone or with a cup of tea . When we ran out this week , we walked to the new store instead and purchased a different brand and both were disappointed . They were more costly , more fattening , and came in prettier wrapping papers , but the Ting Ting Jahe is so far superior that I 'm going to purchase a few more bags today.UPDATE : Just bought the bags and they are now packaged differently . Each candy is in a sealed foil wrapper instead of the rice paper and paper wrapper with the ends twisted . Now the rice paper is not attached but you still get a similar taste and texture , and the ginger is even stronger . They are more chewy , too . They improved a great product !	1
These ginger candies are great on their own , and make a great cup of tea as well . Just drop one or two of them in a cup of hot water , and steep for about 5 minutes while mushing them around to help dissolve them . They will completely melt and make a delicious , sweet and gingery cup of tea . If you find them too spicy on their own , making them with the tea significantly cuts down on the spicyness but still gives you the sweet ginger flavor .	1
I started eating this candy when I was pregnant with my son about 3 years ago . It really helps with nausea and I always keep a pack with me . This also makes a great cup of ginger tea . Just put 2 to 3 of the candies in a cup and pour hot water on them . Start stirring and when they are mostly or completely dissolved , you have a great cup of ginger tea . No need to add sugar or anything else . I have morning sickness again and am constantly eating this candy and making tea with it . I introduced my mother-in-law to it and she loves it now as well . The cup of tea can also help when your stomach hurts and with indigestion.FYI : Do not try to peel off the second wrapping on the candy . You can eat it since it is made of clear thin rice paper . The rice paper also dissolves in the hot water when making your ginger tea .	1
Need I say more . I love this stuff . It is soft and chewy and oh soooooo good . I do n't offer it to children and many adults find it to spicy but if you love ginger , you will really love this candy . It starts out just sweet and then the spicy taste develops .	1
Like many ginger chews , can be difficult to get them out of the individual wraps . Once out , they are SO GOOD . Nice ginger bite , but not overpowering . Need to find them in bulk , or bigger bags .	1
One can never have enough MarketSpice tea on hand ! This tea is true to it 's heritage - a wonderful , full bodied tea . Will definitely be ordering again .	1
As a classic Seattle tea , this tea brings back memories of hiding away from the rainy weather sipping a delicious naturally sweet cinnamon citrus tea . When I drink this tea , I am home again . This tea has a unique personality that seems to embody the entire mood of Seattle in one cup.This is a delicious tea that should be brewed for at least 5 minutes to bring out all the flavors . You can sweeten this more if you like with Stevia or a natural sugar to enhance the natural sweetness . It is good with a touch of Muscovado Sugar from India Tree.~The Rebecca Review	1
Market Spice tea was introduced to me quite by accident . I attended a bridal shower and ended up with a tea & coffee prize basket . Tucked inside was a sample packet of Market Spice Cinnamon Orange tea . I was instantly addicted when I sipped my first cup . No sugar , no calories and sweet as can be . I usually drink the regular and today tried the decaf for the first time , it 's just as good as the regular . This stuff is amazing . I 've ordered several times this year and will continue to drink this as long as its available . One teabag is strong enough for a BIG mug , sweet from start to finish . It 's perfect .	1
My husband prefers orange spice teas , he has a favorite hot one , a favorite herbal orange spice blend and this is both of our favorite for iced tea . The flavor is very strong and it is so naturally sweet that we never add sugar or any other sweetener to it . I suggest it to friends who are dieting for it 's strong flavor and sweetness.It 's delicious . I find it a bit too strong hot , but over ice it 's amazing .	1
BRAVO Greek coffee is NOT FOR THE WEAK ! It 's quite potent , so read and follow the directions carefully . I 've put one teaspoon each of coffee powder & sugar ; into a cup after adding hot water ... and it 's incredibly kicky . I 've put Turkish-style coffee ( Cafe Najjar Classic Turkish-style Ground Coffee 450g ( 1 Lbs ) ( Lebanon ) ( Pack of 10 ) through the regular auto drip , treating it like other ground coffee ... and let 's just say it was a major wake up call ! It makes Starbucks taste like weak sauce in comparison.Greece is considered the cradle of Western civilization , from Plato ( Plato Complete Works ) to Aristotle ( The Basic Works of Aristotle ( Modern Library Classics ) ) , the works of Euripides , the first modern psychological playwright ( Electra and Other Plays : Euripides ( Penguin Classics ) ) , Sophocles who gave us the Oedipus complex ( The Three Theban Plays : Antigone ; Oedipus the King ; Oedipus at Colonus ) The ancient Greeks gave us their mythology , their philosophical insights , their politics . Opera diva Maria Callas , pundit George Stephanopoulos , shock singer Diamanda Galas , all have Greek heritage.This coffee is best served with some tranquil Greek music ( Putumayo Presents Greece : A Musical Odyssey , Gentle World : Santorini Splendor , MUSIC FROM THE WINE LANDS , A Mediterranean Odyssey : Athens To Andalucia ) In `` Music from the Wine Lands '' , the late Greek diva Vicky Moscholiou compares herself to strong coffee in the song `` O Cafes . '' Her song certainly fits BRAVO 's tough blend ! Drink deep !	1
It 's very different ! you get two different tates , like a chocolate combo , I mix it with lavazzo cremo e gusto very tastey combo !	1
For everyone who is wondering if you can put this coffee into an automatic drip machine : of course you can . But it 's not intended to be prepared that way and you can tell that as soon as you open the bag . This is a light roast Greek coffee , which means it 's blonder than even blonde coffee connoisseurs might be accustomed to . It 's also a very fine grind , so fine it forms moist little clumplets in the bag . It gives off an aroma that puts me more in mind of baking cocoa than of Starbucks . And it brews up with a fine head of crema more naturally than any espresso I 've ever had to tamp . The instructions on how to make Greek coffee are on the back of the bag , and the only thing you might be missing in your kitchen is a briki , but if you have a small pot with an interior that wo n't react badly with the coffee you will be fine , especially if the pot has some taper at the top . I had a fondue pot going unused that filled in nicely . The coffee really does have a strong cocoa-like flavor to it , it is not very bitter , and it tastes better with just sugar no cream . I imagine this would make for some really good camp coffee too . It 's probably not going to replace my everyday city blend , but for a treat it 's really good .	1
I have been making Turkish coffee for 15 years now . After having the best cup of coffee in my life at a Greek restaurant I asked the waiter what brand he used . I bought a bag immediately and have been converted . I had my coffee ground fresh at middle eastern markets for years both in the U.S. , Lebanon and Jordan.Only a few times was I able to get this amazing taste in the Mid East but never here.My husband who is Middle Eastern loves this so much he went from a cup a week to two cups a day . Its a very difficult thing to get a Middle Eastern person to say any kind of food or drink is better than what there own country produces.Because I make this in the Turkish method I use 1 heaping teaspoon for a smaller Turkish coffee cup . I noticed the Greek preparation uses a cup double that size with the same amount of coffee so its not quite as potent that way .	1
I & # 8217 ; ve grown up with Vegeta as one of the & # 8220 ; essential & # 8221 ; spices . Once I moved to the US it became almost impossible to come by , and only brought here occasionally after a trip to Croatia . It & # 8217 ; s a very flavorful spice that can serve as a salt substitute . It adds some complexity and richness to your savory dishes . I am glad that it & # 8217 ; s becoming increasingly available in stores , even in some small and out of the way places . However , I know that I can & # 8217 ; t count on it being available wherever I go , and therefore I am really excited to have it available through Amazon . It is reasonably priced , especially considering that it & # 8217 ; s a heavy-ish product . Thanks to Amazon Prime I was able to get it in just a couple of days . One tin usually lasts me several months so I will not need another one for a while . Overall , extremely satisfied with both the product and the service .	1
I was introduced to this seasoning just recently at a friends house . I had a chicken soup lunch there that was delicious and I remember remarking on the seasoned salt that I thought they added . Turns out it was this Vegeta seasoning . This stuff really is different than any other seasoning I have ever come across . The list of ingredients on it will tell you it 's one of a kind . In many ways it sorta reminds me of spicy V8 juice in a powdered form with salt added . And make no mistake about it , this stuff is heavy on the salt . If you are someone on a salt restricted diet , or just should n't be eating it you should either use this stuff very sparingly or not at all . On the other hand if you you are a salt lover , or just love a salty seasoning that has a taste all its own , this is your huckleberry for sure . I especially love it in sauces and soups , stews , and stir fries , and trust me , a little goes a long way . So this big can of it will be around for quite a while . All I got from my friend was a little tin of it to take home , so when that runs out I will be ordering it here on Amazon , ( like my friend does . And like just about everyone else does since it 's near impossible to find in stores ) . This is a great spice to take the place of seasoned salt , ( or regular salt as well ) in any recipe that will greatly enhance what ever it is your cooking in my opinion . Really delicious stuff that I highly recommend ... : )	1
I have used this stuff for years and love it in soups and veggies . A purist wood never use it but sometimes a little slumming is good for the soul .	1
I am a seasoning nut and like to try new things that are not found in our local supermarket . I have used Vegeta in a number of recipes and have learned that a little goes a long way . It is very salty , but a nice addition to soups , stews and vegetable dishes !	1
I use a lot of spices and other seasonings and will add this to my collection as a good middle of the road seasoning . Great for soup and omlettes based on my first two uses since I got it . I like the choice of vegetables that it contains as they make a nice flavorful stock in pretty much any dish that contains liquids . It definitely is not peppery or highly spiced . And the chicken flavoring complements the other ingredients . It will be good with winter vegetables and stews .	1
Years ago , there was a Japanese restaurant where I could get ice cold barley tea , occasionally . They did n't always have it on the menu because of the brewing process taking so much time . I loved that tea . When they had it on hand , I ordered two very large containers of it.Recently , I read about Barley tea bags , the House-Mugicha Barley Tea , in particular . So , I found it and ordered it from Amazon , some for me and some for a friend of mine.The order was filled before the estimated time of delivery for both of us . Well , she loves it and so do I . Tastes just like that tea I liked in the Japanese restaurant only , I brew it anytime I like.It 's so easy . I just put one bag in a nearly two gallon jug , fill it with cold filtered water and place it in the fridge overnight.I plan to order more from Amazon too and so does my friend . She is supposed to drink more water and the Barley tea helps her to do just that.Note : This kind of tea has many health benefits besides just tasting good . The Japanese have been drinking it for centuries for good health . And ... it will cool down the body nicely during a hot Summer day .	1
After having a great experience with barley tea , I figured that I needed to find some bags to brew up my own tea . ( It 'd be cheaper , that 's for sure . ) What initially drew me to this brand was that the instructions are in English , which is something that is not guaranteed with each brand out there on Amazon . If you are new to brewing , this is will be easy for you to understand.The teabags are sealed up in foil packets , with many bags in one packet , so depending on how long you 'll go between usages you might want to put the remaining bags in the foil packet in a ziplock . ( I know that some are especially sensitive to the difference in taste that comes from teabag containers being left open . ) Each bag can be used to make 1 quart of tea.This tastes pretty good and I loved how easy it was to make . You can either brew it with hot water or leave it in the refridgerator to brew in cold water . It 's rather fast when it comes to steeping , so I was able to enjoy the tea after a few hours in the fridge.I 'm absolutely going to purchase this again when I head back to my local Asian food market .	1
I lived in Japan for 4 years so perhaps I was predisposed to like this sort of thing , but after trying it once at a Japanese restaurant , I was hook . I recently found this product and recommend it highly.One teabag makes a large pitch of this pleasant , mild tea . It 's taste reminds me a bit of Sugar Smacks without the sugar , or even Cheerios . Does n't sound like a good taste for tea you say ? Well , you 'd be suprised . A co-worker who tasted it said it reminds her of coffee , which I can see too.Recent studies have shown it has many health benefits , including the ability to improve the fludity of the blood . I 'm not sure how that translates into overall well being , but I know that drinking it makes me feel healthy , and I enjoy the flavor . It may not be everyone 's cup of tea ( sorry , had to ) , but it is worth trying at least once I 'd say . I have a container at work and I sip iced Barley tea throughout the day .	1
This is just how I remember drinking barley tea for the first time in Shinjuku , Japan . This tea tastes just as great and brings back memories for me . It has a toasty nuttiness flavor , similar to dandelion tea but more light and refreshing . Says you can steep in cold water , but I enjoy it by putting one tea bag in my coffee maker and brewing it that way . Makes a wonderful morning coffee replacement . Individual tea bags are larger than normal , each making 1 qt of tea ( equivalent to 4 cups or 2 water bottles ) . I drink lots of healthy tea ( moringa , dandelion , green tea , white tea , oolong ) , and this one of my favorites ! I find placing one tea bag into my coffemaker is so convenient for me as it is enough to fill a 10 cup carafe with strong flavor within minutes ( not watered down and faster than cold steeping ) . For any left over hot tea , I let it cool down to room temperature and place it in the fridge for a refreshing drink anytime . My highest recommendation for this tea is using clean , great tasting water as it really makes a difference.I only see one ingredient listed on the box : Barley . Manufactured by House Foods Corp in Tokyo , Japan . Hope this helps .	1
I was trying to find a kind of rice tea that I 've had at Korean restaurants in the past . I thought this might be it , but it 's not . What I did discover was that barley tea tastes exactly , yes exactly ! , like twig tea , which is one of my favorite teas . Kind of a coffee bean flavor . Note that I 'm not a fan of coffee , so I do n't say it tastes like coffee . Rather , it tastes like how coffee beans smell . And like twig tea , it 's caffeine free.So depending on the price , you might want to research which is the better deal since twig and barley are virtually identical . Of course , this barley tea comes packaged in a HUGE bag . I only make 1 cup at a time so I prefer the regular , smaller tea bags , but it 's no big deal just reusing this big bag for cup after cup .	1
This is a very flavorful salt alternative ( it still has salt in it , but it has less ) . I like to use it for about anything , but especially for making veggie burgers .	1
I do n't add any purchased salad dressings . Being Greek I follow the greek style salad dressing : olive oil , lemon , salt and herbs in all my salads , not only in the greek salad . I was using fresh and/or dry herbs . And when I found this Herbamare salt I loved it . It has all of the herbs I was adding to my salad , but additional ones that taste great in salads.You can also add it to your rice , to your vegetables , to your meats , etc , etc . It gives a great , light , pleasant flavor to everything you add it on . It does n't have an overwhelming taste.Everybody that tastes my salads loves them and asks me how I make them . I tell them the secret is the salad dressing . The simpler and most natural the better . I tell them about my Herbamare and now they are all buying it for their salads . And of course , I keep buying.The best part I like about this product : it is organic ! ! ! !	1
The best seasoning ! I am so glad that I gave this product a chance . I use it in the place of regular salt on almost everything . YUM !	1
I love herbamare ! It 's my favorite go to spice . It 's vegan and natural and delicious . No msg or flour or sugar or anything other than spice .	1
I 've been using Herbamare for years ; I first discovered it in a health food store and have buying it ever since . I love the fact that this fine sea salt ( originating from Switzerland and now manufactured in France ) , is infused with 13 different organic herbs and veggies . The flavor of the blend is so satisfying , I use less salt ; I put Herbamare on everything , from fish to veggies ... I even got my mother hooked on the taste ! The 500 gram ( 1.1 lb . ) price on Amazon is better than my local health food stores , so I have been buying it here . So many glowing reviews ... there 's a reason for it ! Try this salt ; it will become a staple in your kitchen too.Just an FYI ; the container I just received has a June 2016 expiration date , which provides me with over 2 years time to consume , but I doubt very highly if the container will be around that long ... : )	1
We have used this product for years and recommend it during our workshops we teach on healthy eating . It has a good taste without adding too much of a salty taste to the food .	1
We love this product ! Arrived on time and as promised .	1
I love Herbamare . A friend introduced me to this years ago when every soup she made tasted so wonderful and I had to know her secret . This is a great seasoning and the salt in it is Sea salt . Healthier than most others on the market .	1
This is my favorite coffee ordered online , and I have ordered quite a few . Bold but not bitter , and good for a crowd . This is also a very nice price for good coffee , from what I have found .	1
My experiences had been drip coffee - a lot of it , over the years . I recently bought an espresso machine , and started experimenting with different coffees.Some stuff I did n't like all that much - Illy dark and medium roast was kind of flat for me , sort of bland . Peet 's Italian stuff was chocolately , but muddy/muddled in flavors.This , though , Crema e Aroma , absolutely lives up to it 's name . Lots of flavor starting with the aroma when you open the bag and grind : mouth-filling , round , with that coffee taste I adore . It 's got a fair amount of persistence , that taste , which may not be great for some folks , but I really like it.I get nice crema from this , pressure PF or plain PF ( it 's a small retail DeLonghi BAR-32 , but I have a non-pressure filter for it ) . The shot starts dark , blonding only a little , and the crema is a beautiful camel tan/brown that fills the room with the smell of great coffee.It 's got some caffeine , for sure , I get a pretty strong buzz after a double.I love this coffee !	1
this was the first time i purchased this product , it has performed very well with my La Pavoni machine , it has good depth and body , it produces a nice crema when done the right way , i will buy it again .	1
Do you love the charred flavor of Starbucks at $ 4 a pop for a thimbleful of overpriced swill ? Then you 'll feel like a Mensa genius after trying Lavazza Crema e Aroma Beans . This price is genuinely a bargain if you shop around the internet . Even if you 're using a $ 20 grinder with a whirly bird blade and a Sam 's Club espresso machine , your toes will curl with a brew of these beans . No I do n't work for these guys . But if you really love your morning espresso or cappuccino smooth and hearty you 'll love Lavazza . Just be prepared for friends start dropping by and mooching a fix once word gets out .	1
This works very well for espresso . I use it in a Solis Crema espresso machine to make shots and lattes . Great flavor for espressos .	1
Lavazza produces wonderful coffee and this is my favorite . It works well for espresso or a French press . The flavor is not at all bitter . It has a wonderful aroma and a very mellow flavor . It has never disappointed me or those I make coffee for .	1
As promised , this is an oily medium-roasted bean that produces ample crema . The flavor is excellent . Caveat emptor : I 'm not an aficionado , and I 'm brewing with a pretty well used Isomac Venus ( wish I had my Silvia back ... ) . No modifications . So I wait until the boiler is done heating and the element turns off , and brew immediately . I do n't have a thermometer . I do n't have a digital thermostat . I 'm just someone who knows what they like , likes a good espresso , especially a latte or cappuccino with strong coffee and unadulterated , no crap in it ( no syrup , sugar , powder , etc. ) . Just good espresso and hot milk . I 've been making at least one daily double-shot with a 21g basket in a single-spout portafilter for over a decade . As such , I can say , this is good coffee . I like a lot of the Lavazza roasts though , and LOVE Illy whole-bean medium roast ... . as well as one especially terrific local cafe 's roast ... and I DESPISE Starbucks coffee . Their espresso is barely recognizable as coffee , as opposed to charred anything . That 's just to help place my taste buds on the spectrum . I offer a strong recommendation for this one . Great coffee , good price .	1
As earlier posted , Lavazza products are some of the foremost Italian coffees . It 's delicious to those of us who appreciate quality coffee .	1
This is the only sea salt I 'll use now . This has the right texture , size , and taste for all my cooking needs . Just a small amount sprinkled on food gives an abundance of flavor . The package is comes in is an added bonus . Try it -- you 'll love it !	1
This is excellent salt . I really enjoy the flavor and enjoy my food with this product . It 's a bit pricey , but a nice treat once in a while . It was n't as finely ground as I thought it would be , but the flavor makes up for that minor detail .	1
I love this salt , and use it constantly . It really tastes great , and adds to any dish . Shipped promptly . I will definitely order again .	1
This salt is very fine -more powdery compared to other rough sea salts . This makes it so that when you cook , you might not have to sprinkle ( or grind ) it in as early , and you can throw some uncooked without grittiness . And it is so good . How can you describe salt ? Salty ? You 'll have to try for yourself , but it is very fresh tasting , and sprinkle it on the worst cooked food , and it will still be edible because this fleur de sel is of such high quality . After eating any dish with this salt , it makes me seriously crave more of food in general with this salt , like what MSG does , but without the thirsty , dizzying effects of an MSG laden meal.The top sticker is even signed by the salt harvester , making it more personalized if you 're looking to send a gift for someone . And , for those who are curious , it is not stored in very thick packaging . Just some light cardboard feeling material as the base and a lightweight lid similar to that of a wine cork.Note : this Carmague fleur de sel is essentially the uppermost layer of the bed of sea salts laid out to dry under the French sun , and is the most clear . If you 're just looking to go buying French salts in general , this is n't going to look like some Britanny sea salts which can be wet , dark grey , or light grey , but instead will be dry , fine , and whitest of white .	1
This is a product I seen on the food network . Works great on steak . I mix it with crushed pepper to season my meat .	1
We 've tried many other brands over the years , but we always return to this one . The taste is mild and does n't have the & # 34 ; crunch & # 34 ; some lesser brands tend to have.This is a SEA salt , so will naturally have some moisture . This does n't mean it 's gone bad . . .it means it was properly packed .	1
This is used in addition to my other salts of choice , sea and Kosher . I delivers a type of vanilla flavor , especially when used in things like pancakes , waffles , and some deserts that call for a touch of salt .	1
I purchased a & # 34 ; salts of the world collection & # 34 ; here on amazon awhile back . It was in a beautiful glass front cabinet/box and ran about $ 149 . That was my first experience with salt other than kosher salt . Of course it had Fleur De Sel . 7 different to be exact . I liked the & # 34 ; Velvet & # 34 ; gray salt 's texture But this has been by far my best salt . It feels almost damp and the crystal sizes vary . I grilled two steaks the other day and decided not to salt before or while cooking . I used my other favorite seasonings but waited until the steak was plated to add this salt . I watched it melt on the surface of those still sizzling steaks , It was so excellent . Morton 's girl still has her spot in history and this is n't for everything ( like using this to pickle would make me miss a mortgage payment ) , do n't miss a payment ! but try something different every now and then . It helps my worldview . I also enjoyed the pink Himalayan unprocessed coarse grain salt I just got here on amazon as well . It 's a big crunchy bite of pink salt .	1
Yamamotoyama teas are delicious . This is a brand you can trust to provide a high quality product at a very reasonable price . If you have n't tried Roasted Green Tea and you drink more than Orange Pekoe , live large and give this a try .	1
I really like the roasted flavor and fragrance to this tea . It 's great with meals or even as a snack.They come in aluminum sealed tea bags , which maintains freshness.I 've tried a few of the Yamamotoyama teas and I would definitely recommend trying this brand . It does n't cost much and you can add it on when you buy $ 25 or more .	1
This tea has a unique roasted flavour , and can be brewed several times . The second and third brews feel smoother and sweeter . Give it a try . It 's good .	1
I got hooked on the roasted tea when I visited Tokyo , I just recently discovered it on Amazon and hoped it was similar to what I found in Japan . This is good stuff , I am ordering a bunch !	1
I have been buying YamaMotoYama for quite a few years , but had never tried this particular tea . I really like it and actually prefer it over their regular green tea or the GenMai Cha that I 've been drinking lately . I would still keep the other types of tea on hand , but this Hoji Cha is good for a substitute for coffee in the morning - it has a deeper taste than regular green tea.I just wish it was sold in those large 90 count packages - 16 tea bags does n't last very long and those large packages are usually a better value . : o }	1
I used to think of jasmine tea , as probably tasting like liquid perfume or those potpourri satchels you buy for your lingerie drawer.I was wrong.Jasmine tea tastes like a sweet flowery delicate elixer . Its comforting , not too strong , and perfect as a before meal or after meal palate cleanser . Yamamotoyama tea is found in most asian markets , and its top quality for a low price . I have had several of their teas and have been impressed by every one of them .	1
One of my favorites from this company as well the roasted rice tea . A pleasant aroma , and very tasty teas .	1
It has a light , sweet , flowery taste and fragrance to match . The taste and scent is calming and relaxing.They come in aluminum sealed tea bags , which maintains freshness.I 've never had Jasmine tea before until I ordered this off Amazon . I was n't really sure what to expect from a flower flavored tea . But since it does n't cost that much and I can add it on to any order of $ 25 , I gave it a try . It 's really good . I 've become a fan of most Yamamotoyama teas .	1
I 've tried a few Jasmine teas and a few Jasmine green teas ... .And this one really does reach the top two ! You do n't lose the Jasmine flavor as you do in some other teas around here , and I like to suck on the tea bag because its not too strong and it has wonderful flavor . If you 're looking for something a bit more naturally sweet I would suggest Bigelow Jasmine Green tea .	1
This is a very delicate candy that taste like strawberries and cream . It melts in your mouth and has a very good taste . I got it for my daughter who is into all things Japanese .	1
The taste of these little chocolates is slightly strange , but somehow addicting . Obviously not as good as real chocolate covered strawberries , slight perfumey strawberry taste , but could n't stop eating them . Cute unique shape and packaging - great for Asian candy lovers .	1
I did n't think I 'd like these Apollo strawberry-chocolate candies because I 'd heard they were kind of waxy . Still , I wanted to try them at least once , just to see for myself.And how were they , you ask ? Delicious ! It 's true that the consitency is a little waxy , but it 's hardly noticable . In fact , it 's more creamy than anything . It 's sweet , but not too sweet . The strawberry and chocolate flavors blend perfectly together . You get plenty in a box , too.I was pleased with the lack of saturated and trans-fat , too . It 's 28g sugar for one box , which is n't too bad.The box design is very appealing , too . The colors and design are eye-catching . If you look closely , you can see that the strawberry seeds are actually done in gold foil . The mascot rabbit is also adorable . There are little riddles on the top flaps with answers on the bottom flap . They 're in Japanese , but it 's good practice for those learning the language.So there you have it- a tasty , attractive snack without all the fat . It 's like eating guilt-free strawberry cream bon-bons ! I 'll definitely be eating this again .	1
I got these out of curiosity- I like Meiji brand chocolates but had only really had the mushroom- and bamboo-shaped ones . The box is pretty small ( and rather banged up , but it did n't affect the contents . ) Its quite difficult not to eat the whole thing in one sitting . The chocolate has a sweet dark chocolate flavor , but not overly sweet . The strawberry flavor is more of a hint , but strong enough to still know its there . Overall it was a nice balanced flavor . I would get them again ! I wish they were easier to come by locally .	1
I will never run out of sunflower seeds now . This bag is huge . Using it for my own protein bars and sunflower butter .	1
Anyone reading any of my reviews knows I have hamsters . Hamsters love seeds . I love them myself , so we share . I do n't like having to open them though , so these are perfect . A pound lasts a nice long while . I also use them when I make cookies and nut bread .	1
I choose this to try in smoothies but some things taste too good to grind in a smoothie . I would recommend this for flavor and freshness .	1
These sunflower seeds are the freshest and nice size , no pieces of hulls . I can eat them right from the package and in baking not having to be concerned about biting into a hull . I highly reccomend them..	1
Love the packaging and the quality of these seeds . They last a long time . I 've cooked with them and use them in my smoothies .	1
I purchased the & # 34 ; super foods book & # 34 ; and all it talked about was adding more greens & seeds . I 've never been a seeds kind of eater , but I want to start a healthier diet so I decided I would try them out . They really are n't too bad . I just throw them in with all the other stuff in & mix it up in the nutribullet .	1
These Raw Sunflower Kernels seem to be okay , though they did smell a tad stale . ( I immediately removed them from the BPA plastic bag and vacuum sealed them in a Mason Jar . They taste okay and will most likely be fine to incorporate in some recipes I have .	1
These seeds are what I expected when I ordered them . They are fresh , I did n't find any hulls . They taste good . The package arrived intact and on schedule . I 'll order them again .	1
I wanted a product that had no salt added . I was able to toast these up and they were very good .	1
These are so yummy . I like to make my own trail mixes and I always use sunflower seeds . I always use roasted and unsalted sunflower seeds . I wanted to try something new and I found these raw sunflower seeds , and they are great in my trail mixes .	1
The seeds are just wonderful ! Very fresh and crisp . They are the perfect addition to the trail mix I am making . They are a great snack too .	1
Nice big fat tasty sunflower seeds that are great on salads , baking , snack ! Buy these and you wo n't be disappointed !	1
I had been very hesitant to try this product because of the `` no calorie '' claim , and some bad reviews that I 've read but , I decided to give it a chance . I tried it with strawberries and lo and behold it is pretty darn good . I definitely would n't advise eating it on it 's own , it 's not like chocolate in the sense that it can hold it 's own but it gives a nice illusion of chocolate when paired with other things . I look forward to seeing what else it is good with , but for anyone on a diet I would highly recommend it . This has become one of my diet food staples .	1
The Walden Farms Chocolate Dip was a good find for me , but perhaps calling this `` Chocolate '' was a mistake since it only slightly resembles chocolate by looks and taste . It should be treated as a dessert dip/topping for dieters or diabetics . Being a Type 2 diabetic , I am always looking for low carb sweets that will not impact my blood sugar levels and this Dip/Topping has no impact at all.I like the flavor and use it to augment fruits and other sugar free foods to round out the dish . This works well with strawberries and with peanut butter.Recommended , if you set your expectations to match the reality that this is not really chocolate .

I 'm not a huge fan of fruit . I am a huge fan of chocolate . I am always dieting and having this stuff to dip berries , especially strawberries , is just what the doctor ordered . It does impart just the right amount of chocolatey-ness to make you think you 're eating chocolate-covered fruit . I 've tried it with very favorable results with strawberries and even orange segments.Many of Walden Farms ' products are not to my liking , but this one is well worth the money . I think Ms Bad Review , below , probably tried to eat the sauce like either straight ( which would n't be awful , just underwhelming ) or I do n't know what . I ca n't imagine anyone finding this stuff to be BAD . At worst , it 's just , `` eh . ''	1
I 'm a terrible chocolate craving fiend , and this stuff really helps me out . But this is like a lot of Walden Farms products . You are going to see reviews that say OH GOD IT 'S SO TERRIBLE BOO HOO . But you inevitably find that these people stuck the stuff straight from a spoon into their face.Listen.IT IS A DIP . IT IS A DIP , A DIP A DIP A DIP . It is not designed to be eaten alone . It is made with cellulose gel , cocoa , and artificial sweetener ... of course it has a `` weird '' taste if you just shove it plain into your mouth . It 's just like if you shoved your mouth full of splenda ! ! ( That is essentially what you 're doing after all . ) It 's amazing on strawberries , apples , anything with a bit of tartness to it . It is not , however , good on bananas because yeah ... it does have a slight acidity , and when you put it on a banana it 's just like ... what the hell . But seriously . Any kind of berries , just do it .	1
if you need a pick me up for work or any other activity but do n't have time to brew a cup of coffee this is the way to go .	1
A wonderful mellow coffee and milk flavor , sweet , with little aftertaste . And the texture ... These candies are almost crisp , like hard toffee . Wonderful	1
These are excellent . My cousin from New Zealand introduced me to these as he loves them . I wish they would sell them in stores in my neighborhood .	1
These are like the butter candies but with coffee . They are pretty addictive , though not severely unhealthy , and great to give out to co-workers . I even substituted coffee with these candies at one point . They also go very well with coffee .	1
I 've tried many brands , and as a former coffee shop owner , I am 100 % in favor or these over all the others I have had . No corn syrup like the others either . Good balance of sweet to coffee taste in a rectangular candy . THe 4.2 oz size seems to be over priced since I see these at Lotte and other markets around $ 2.50 for that size and saw an 8+ oz size for the same price from another seller ... that 's a better deal . These , unlike many , do n't break up in your mouth either ... smooth all they way ... no sharp edges as they dissolve away . Yum ... try the cappuccino version too ... absolutely wonderful candies .	1
Yes , we 're very pleased with the flavor and size of these mushrooms , but even more amazing is the cost ! 16 oz . of Shitake mushroom caps costs 7 times this at our favorite grocery ... .yes , seven times ! True the mushroom caps in our local grocery had all the stems removed and there are some stems in this package , but gracious ! For the difference in price I 'll gladly remove stems if we do n't want them there . ( And hum happily while doing it ) Further the order arrived in only 3 days without expedited shipping , and it was extremely well packaged so there was absolutely no crushing of the product.You can bet we 'll be buying our Shitakes here from now on ! - Gail Cooke	1
First , let 's get to the product . These are a good , basic product made up of `` caps '' ( there are in fact stem pieces in most of the caps , but limited to about 1/2 inch maximum ) . They average about 2-3 inches in diameter , and are well-dried and packed in plastic bags ( not re-sealable.. but does n't matter for mushrooms ) Dried mushrooms are not ( and never will be ) `` like fresh '' anymore than say , dried basil , will become `` fresh '' basil . But they are an ingredient in their own right . They provide spectacular flavor ( and these are excellent ) . It is worth noting that , because most people who cook by soaking dried mushroom chop them before adding to the end-product . This is because their texture is rather `` rubbery '' as noted by another reviewer . For that reason these are `` overkill '' . If you can find shiitake bits and pieces at better prices , by all means use that instead . Personally I find this meaty chewiness to be pleasant , but some may be put off by it.. you could even put them through a processor after soaking and recovering the liquid.. I certainly would n't toss them ! I think at $ 11-12 per pound they are reasonably priced , but not bargains.. still much cheaper than fresh . A pound dried is probably 20 pounds fresh or better.Shipping is an added hit . I try to group purchases of several items in order to `` even out '' the shipping costs . JR Mushrooms has quite an array of products if you go to their Amazon page . I have had excellent luck with J R Mushrooms in the past and they are a `` go-to '' for me often.My co-op has dried mushrooms ( more expensive and not as high a quality.. but they are expensive anyways ) If you have a sizable Asian community , you may be able to find them at better prices locally.I did n't discover dried mushrooms in my food experience until recently.. I have integrated them into my cuisine ... a staple part . I find now that in other countries , dried are everyday items in their cooking . Mushrooms are something I did n't like ( and had little exposure to ) as a child , but in later life I 've discovered their wonders ! Fresh mushrooms are fine , but are not cheap and keep very poorly.. what to do ? DRIED ! I rarely make a stock-based dish that I do n't add dried mushrooms to in some form . I also use fresh for salads and the like , but dried ROCKS.Aside : On `` The Mind of a Chef '' ( PBS ) identical dried shiitakes are used in a highly-rated Japanese noodle broth , THEN they take the caps out and pickle them in a soy sauce as a separate product.. typical `` country boy '' resourceful !	1
... money wise , in any case . They 're much cheaper than in any stores in our area . The only drawback is cleaning them off and breaking off the stems . It might take a while . Otherwise , no complaints . They 're delicious after soaking them for about 20 minutes in cold water . I love them in gravies and over potatoes and pasta .	1
I grew up up in a family that loved mushrooms , so I love using them in my cooking . Dried mushrooms are convenient because they keep so well ! Porcini 's are one of my favorite mushrooms , and JR Mushrooms brand have an excellent quality . AB rating means they have caps and stems , and AA rating will give you get more caps . Stems are slightly more chewer , but I like the flavor of both caps and stems.To reconstitute them I put them in water and then put them into the microwave for 4 minutes to get the water boiling . Then let them cool . If some of them are still hard I repeat the process on the ones that are still not soft . Then I cook with them like I would with fresh mushrooms.They are easy to use in many different ways . They taste great sauteed in butter . I like adding them to stews or as ingredient for any sauce I make for cooking chicken . I also found they go great with any Indian sauce , like Pataks : Pataks Vindaloo Curry Paste 10 OzMushrooms , what do they taste like : * PORCINI - sweet , nutty flavor reminds me of hazelnut* OYSTER - mild , slightly nutty* CHANTERELLES - sweet mushrooms with flavors that make me think of corn* BLACK TRYMPETS - smokey flavor* CREMENI - more flavorful than button mushrooms , but not as strong as shiitake or portobellos* ENOKI - very delicate flavor , slightly crunchy if fried* PORTOBELLOS - meaty flavor* SHIITAKES - rich , almost beefy flavorJR Mushrooms offer great quality at reasonable price . I recommend them ! Ali Julia review	1
Need to rinse off and I also add boiling water for 1-2 mins , drain , then add more to reconstitute . With almost every commercially dried food some sort of preservatives are added . The initial rinse & quick soak removes all traces ( I think ) .Flavor is great . Color , large pieces , not much crumbled . Price for the quality is very cheap IMO . Fabulous staple , great for cream of mushroom soup . ( btw , using Greek yogurt with low/no fat milk is a fabulous & tasty substitute for cream ) Will be ordering these as I need .	1
I first tried these last year and absolutely fell in love . The only fresh mushrooms we can get here are the very basics so to add these is heavenly.Soups , stews , egg dishes , gravies , meatloaf , these mushrooms make just about everything taste better ! And it 's so easy . I rinse them quickly before letting them soak as I 'm a bit lazy and did n't want to filter the liquid as they recommend on their website . I 've never had any problem . I use the liquid as well , and if I do n't use it in that recipe , I save it for another ! It 's that good ! I cheat and use my Keurig to soak them in a 4 cup vessel with 2 of the large size cups . Perfect every time . I usually grab two very large handfuls of the porcinis to reconstitute.Beware : I accidentally ordered from the wrong vendor a few days ago and got a huge bag of ... literally - garbage . It smelled so odd , was discolored ( dyed ? ) and just gross . I can only think it was the victim of some warehouse flood or something . Amazon refunded my money and I ordered from here again and just got the most fragrant , delicious mushrooms . I 'll never make that mistake again ! Please enjoy these - they are wonderful and I 'm so glad I can get them from Amazon !	1
i agree with all the other reviewers . these are great value and excellent quality . nice big slices and a huge quantity of mushrooms . wonderful for holidays or every day .	1
These are wonderful Porcini . Usually , I do not require uniformity of size in the applications to which I put them so no sense paying more for uniform size . The porcini I had been using I learned were imported from China . These are imported from Italy . Admittedly , since all my genes came from Italy at the beginning of the 20th century , I may be biased . After rinsing these mushroom , I use the soaking water as stock in whatever I am making . The flavor is wonderful and it is easy . I store them in glass canning jars in my pantry and they seem to be holding up nicely . It I got in a fussier mood , I 'd pop the jars in the freezer .	1
We use this primarily for risotto and it 's fantastic . I 've tried more expensive grade porcini mushrooms and notice little difference . This has a nice flavor and since it 's dried , they can last a while in your pantry . Good value .	1
The mushrooms as received were large pieces , being of excellent quality and aroma . Stem pieces predominated , but also made for easier slicing to augment presentations . I 've made some exceptionally flavourful sauces from these mushrooms , including a Marsala rendering that has been well received . There is nothing available in local specialty or general retail markets that comes close to the quality of this product . And I finally add that this is one of the food items I would recommend ordering via the internet .	1
deffinately has a strong truffel tatse if you love the taste of truffles youll love this ! i use it with so many things ! need to get a bigger bottle ! think ill go order one now !	1
Truffle Oil is a flavoring agent . And this inexpensive flavoring product is pretty decent when added to cooking requiring a fungal aromatic.I suppose there could be a real truffle or two or ten added per 100 gallons of olive oil , along with a generous supply of 2,4-DTP for flavor enhancement . Who knows , and really who cares given its price and use ? People certainly buy vanillin instead of vanilla for baking , and that totally artificial ingredient works pretty well in cakes . And people also use other artificial flavorings from pineapple to cherry to almond in their cooking . For those dumping on the product on the chance that its been enhanced , were you expecting 24K gold for the price of Grade 2 straw ?	1
I use this for nice fresh salads & # 62 ; it has a very nice flavor and smell compared to olives . Its a nice change of pace for salad prep	1
This peppercorn mix is absolutely amazing . It adds such a unique flavor to your food , you wo n't want to use anything else . I normally did n't use pepper , I never had a taste for it . But I put this on everything . It 's so aromatic , and gives each dish a certain depth of flavor you wo n't find with other blends . Give it a try , you 'll love it !	1
THe smaell the taste and the almost lighteing fast order time was certinly a great wonder . I keep these in entirly differnt peper mill then regular tellicherry ones and these are a lot hoter real pepper taste .. all those of you who still buy ground pepper and think we fresh grind are silly .. you dont know what your missing ..	1
This is a LOT of peppercorns . They 're so pretty , I was tempted to put them in a clear glass bowl for display . Flavor just fine . Great product .	1
but I probably would not have purchased it if I had read the ingredients list better . This Five Peppercorn Mix also has coriander in it which has a distinct odor . I am not saying it is a bad thing but the pepper smells like coriander and a little different taste than a peppercorn mix without coriander .	1
The peppercorns are great for my fancy grinder . They tend to have almost a nutmeg aroma to them but are very peppery and strong tasting .	1
The blend is beautiful , flavorful and gives of an incredibly fresh and strong pepper scent when ground . The difference between these corns and those bought in a typical supermarket was evident . I was pleased there were almost no broken corns or husk flakes in the bag . The packaging needs to be rethought , though . The peppercorns come in a sealed cellophane bag that is n't really user friendly . Something self sealing would be preferable . If you try and tear off a corner on this bag , the cellophane does n't want to stop tearing when you do . Scissors are the best way to open and you 'll need to find an airtight container to store the rest after filling the grinder . I 'll certainly be purchasing these again .	1
Thumbs up for both high quality and excellent flavor enhancement.My family and friends enjoy this immensely.If you.ve only tried black corns , this mix should upgrade your peppercorn taste sensations .	1
This is some of the best gum I have ever had and I am in my thirties . It is packed with flavor and it just burst in your mouth , and no its not filled with liquid LOL . I would recommend this as something to chew , the boxes only hold about 4 little ball . But , it was worth it , I bought more .	1
Tried this on a whim , a friend sent to me , the melon is amazing ! It just tastes really good.The flavor does n't last very long but I bought a huge case of the watermelonand it 's so yummy it does n't really matter .	1
This gum does contain `` d-sorbitol '' , even though the ingredients on the amazon page does not list it . I wish it didnt , but oh well . The gum has really great flavor and is great to blow bubbles with . However , the flavor is quite short lived . My favorite is the melon , which tastes just like honeydew.The actual ingredient list says : Sugar , Gum Base , Glucose , Corn Syrup , Acids [ CITRIC , MALIC , L-TARTARIC ) , GUM ARABIC , ARTIFICIAL FLAVOR [ STRAWBERRY , ORANGE , GRAPE , MELON , GREEN APPLE , PEACH ) , D-SORBITOL , FRUITS JUICE ( ORANGE , STRAWBERRY , GRAPE , MELON , APPLE , PEACH , ) COLOR ADDED ( GRAPE SKIN EXTRACT , ANNATTO EXTRACT , FC & C ; YELLOW NO. # 6 ) , CORN STARCH , CARNAUBA WAXCALORIES : 15 ( 17 CALORIES FOR ORANGE , GRAPE , MELON , STRAWBERRY ) , CARBS : 4G , SUGAR 3G , FIBER : > 1G	1
This is one of my favorite candy items , and one I think is well purchased by anyone with a sweet tooth , any gum lover , or any one looking for a taste of the orient . Three of the flavors in the package : Peach , Mixed Fruit , and Green Apple are in a ` brick ' form . They are about 1 in X in and are very soft and easy to chew . The remaining four flavors : Orange , Strawberry , Grape , and Melon all come in small boxes that contain four gumballs each.Each flavor is powerful without being overpowering . They have a smooth , almost creamy texture when chewed , and blow nice big bubbles . Also , they 're not overly sweet , or grainy with sugar . My teeth are often sensitive if gum is too sugary , yet these offer no obstacles , only mouth appeal.I highly recommend this gum !	1
This is virtually the best cinnamon oil you can find . Use it sparingly when a recipe calls for it because this is not `` watered '' down as so many others are . Like other items from this vendor , the quality is superior as is the service .	1
I did n't believe the reviews . I have used many cinnamon oils and could not get the hot taste I like without adding cayenne pepper to the recipe . This oil full of the hot flavor I love in my erythritol candy .	1
The pure oil aroma will make you feel great inside . A true value . Use it in baking , blending with other oils . Good to have in you inventory !	1
Great seller ! I needed extracts with natural ingredients , no artificial colors or flavors , and this is the place ! I am making my own hard candy with these flavors as an alternative , and a cheaper way then buying the expensive variety . I ordered some lollipop molds and sticks , and am planning on sending some to school so that the teachers will have something that I approve of my kids eating . Lot 's of teachers give out candy as an award these days , and none of them are free from artificial colors which btw are made from petroleum ! The customer service is excellent too . I asked a question about some ingredients and got a response quickly.As a side note , we have changed our diet in order to get my child off his ADD medication . It 's working ! He has been medication free now for 3 weeks . His teacher has n't said anything negative about his behavior , whereas before , when we would forget to give it to him , she would complain about him . This is working and I could n't be happier .	1
A little goes a long way . I use it to fill the house with Cinnamon smell . Have not try to cook with it yet .	1
I purchased this to use in my coffee instead of the powder ( which just does n't emulsify well ) . Even with just a couple of drops it 's just too strong for me . Cinnamon is touted for its great health benefits but I 'll have to stick to the powder . Great flavor if you can take the heat : )	1
This stuff is great . It might be more expensive than the `` cinnamon flavor '' or `` cinnamon extract '' you get in the grocery store , but it is so much more concentrated that it works out to be cheaper in the long run . I made cinnamon hard candy . To 2 cups sugar and 1/2 cup corn syrup I used 1 teaspoon ( see update below ) cinnamon oil . That made a strong cinnamon flavor without being really hot . Yum.Update : The first time I made this I added the cinnamon oil when the candy was still 290F . I got a cloud of cinnamon steam in my face and perfectly flavored candy . I just tried it again but I let the candy cool slightly before adding the cinnamon . I got less steam ( but still a lot ) and candy that was WAY too spicy . I assume that the first time a bunch of the cinnamon oil evaporated , so the amount you need depends on the temperature of the candy when you add it . Next time I am going to add 1/4 or 1/2 teaspoon to the slightly cooled candy .	1
for making my cinnamon rolls . I liked this product both with its potent strength and its quick shipping . Im glad I found this .	1
It 's getting harder to find pure cinnamon oil but thats exactly what I received . No artificial ingredients . Thanks ! ! !	1
I bought these and the greatest thing besides the awesome price and the fabulous beans is that the VP or CEO or some such lovely gentleman actually emailed me and thanked me for my purchase and when I responded , followed up again with a nice response ! How nice is that in this day and age ! I used these beans in my home made eggnog this year and it was out of this world . I first scraped the bean and then threw the pod in and left it there till the nog was gone . ( not long ) I also use one when I make my hot chocolate `` syrup '' ( Lots of bittersweet chips , melted in milk and a little haff and half and the bean scraped and the pod - once again left in - I mske hot chocolate out of it by adding more milk to taste and a little bitty bit of brandy ... decadent ... oh my yes ! ) This is a great buy , great beans , great company ! Buy with assurance !	1
These were better than any other vanilla bean I have tried . I will order again . The price was also great .	1
I loved the beans I received.They were plump and moist and made my pastry cream infinitely better than when I use vanilla extract.Shipping was quick as was communication .	1
These vanilla beans are a good value for your money . They were even better than expected ; plump and well packaged . Try making vanilla sugar ... .your morning coffee , cakes , cookies , muffins or whatever will never be the same .	1
Item was packaged well , and seems to be of good quality , based on my limited knowledge of vanilla beans . Though I love pure vanilla extract , I 'm new to using the whole bean . I withheld one star just because the flavor , when using the entire bean ( skin included ) , had a subtle `` grassy '' taste . This may be normal , or due to my inexperience and/or improper preparation of the bean , but I thought I correctly followed the directions I had read elsewhere . Regardless , I 'm happy with this product . They certainly smell incredible , and will make your storage area smell delightful .	1
They came vacuum packed for freshness and they arrived earlier than stated . They have the wonderful fresh vanilla aroma that they are supposed to have . I ca n't wait to use them this weekend ! ! !	1
MyCuisinart ICE-21ice cream maker had a recipe for fresh whole vanilla bean ice cream that I wanted to try -- until I encountered the $ 15 price tag on a single bottled bean at the grocery store ! So I ordered 7 fresh beans from Amazon ( specifically from JR Mushrooms , shipped by OliveNation ) for less than half that price.Seven plump , flexible , aromatic vanilla beans soon arrived . It was a treat just to open the package , because the beans smelled so good . They came in a sealed but resealable plastic bag , which I put into a glass jar in my spice cupboard for long-term storage.The French Vanilla Bean ice cream turned out to be wonderful ! And I have enough reasonably priced beans left for six more batches !	1
I 've been buying vanilla beans at my local natural food store forever but decided that I need to find a cheaper source since I am using a full bean every week . Two beans cost $ 10 at the natural food store.These Bourbon-Madagascar vanilla beans are fantastic . They are plump and moist and very fragrant . My only complaint is that they ship in a plastic bag -- shipping is incredibly fast so the time in the plastic bag is minimal and I put them into a glass jar as soon as they arrive . ( My concern with the plastic bag is that the beans can lose their moisture much quicker if not stored correctly . ) I will be buying more of these beans very soon .	1
The vanilla beans are whole , soft , large and plump . These beans are superior to what I can find locally without spending a fortune . What a great value ! They came well ( vacuum ) packaged too . There is nothing like using a vanilla bean in a recipe.Will buy again .	1
Superior vanilla beans come from the Madagascar `` Bourbon Islands , '' Mexico and Indonesia . It took me years to get up the courage to buy a vanilla bean.When I did , I found the flavor was truly superior to vanilla extract . While you do n't want to use vanilla beans in everything ( too expensive ! ) , you will definitely want to consider using them in custards and when you make ice cream.Vanilla enhances everything from creamy porridges to custards and cakes . The list goes on and on . There are so many uses for vanilla . Vanilla is derived from the seductively aromatic vanilla bean.Vanilla beans are actually the cigar-shaped seed pod from a fragrant climbing orchid native to tropical America.Yes , vanilla extract is much more economical , but using vanilla beans is rather gourmet . The extract is created from chopped vanilla beans that are soaked in an alcohol/water solution . It takes about 100 beans to make 1 gallon of extract.I 've been using pieces of vanilla beans , but on Food TVthey always split these down the middle and also scrapeout the vanilla for superior vanilla flavor.~The Rebecca Review	1
had seen these for a while ; took the plunge after reading multiple reviews and checking what was available locally for what price ; this surpasses all I could find locally ; great price ; great product !	1
This was perfect for my sushi rolls , it made the spicy tuna roll perfect ! ! It was easy to open , comes out easily and was n't damaged at all . Thank you ! ! XD	1
To be honest I ordered this HUY FONG brand of SRIRACHA HOT CHILI SAUCE in the 17-oz . plastic bottle because , although an add-on , it pushed an order above the new $ 35 threshold to qualify for SuperSaver shipping . It is good and hot , with a primarily chili-pepper taste , a good clean burn with the requisite side notes of garlic and vinegar , not overly complicated . It works well in a VERY thin line down the middle of my favorite frozen burrito . In fact , I prefer it to our previous brand , Crying Tiger , which is fairly powerful but a little on the sweet side . If this is your first outing with sriracha in a squeeze bottle , keep in mind that it sure ai n't ketchup , and a little dab will almost always do ya . Although the plastic bottle is covered with languages in addition to English , the product is actually made in the good ol ' USA . Strong recommendation .	1
First world problem dilemma . To use sriracha hot chili sauce or frank 's red hot ... This is the dilemma I face everyday . So far the sriracha sauce has been winning though . I 've been adding it to just about everything except for beverages . For now ...	1
I 've been buying all brands of chili and hot sauce products at the local supermarket and thought I would try this brand . It is definitely the best tasting chili sauce available . I use it on meat , vegetables , and anything else that I 'm eating . It 's good to know that it is good for heart health .	1
Hot but not too hot , very flavorful . You may see Sriracha on the table at most of your favorite asian restaurants and it has earned a place on my kitchen table , too .	1
Holy crap guys.What did I get myself into ? This stuff is delicious , and I am NOT a hot sauce lover . I can not tolerate a lot of heat AT ALL . I 'm a huge wuss.I only bought it from Walmart a couple days ago after giving in and wanting to know what the praise was all about . Now I ca n't stop putting it on things.It started with adding it to ramen , then scrambled eggs , then squirting it all over my dinner . It 's like an addiction now.I ca n't describe the taste , it 's just so good . I love how you can control how much heat you want . When I first tried it I could only tolerate a couple drops in ramen and now I squirt it all over food . I built a tolerance that fast . It 's like a drug .	1
I do n't normally go for spicy things , but I got this for my husband to put on my cooking ... I now use it for many different things ( like on top of eggs ... toast..vegges.. ) I like it !	1
I met Huy Fong Spiracha in Thailand where he works as a short order cook at the Thaksin Shinawatra restaurant . He introduced me to his Hot Chili Sauce . It 's Hotter than Hot Hot Hot Hot but adds a nice taste to most rotten boiled eggs , cow brain , dead fish , or raw yak meat.Gives plenty of fire to dead squid too ! Yum !	1
I first ran across Sriracha ( and am still uncertain how to pronounce it ) while eating at a Vietnamese restaurant in California . It was given to me with a seafood entr & eacute ; e and I found that I kept squeezing the bottle and tasting the sauce separately with my fork . Its flavor is absolutely amazing . Yes , the other reviewers are quite correct , it is not a conveyer of great heat , but its texture and flavor are incomparable . I brought it back with me to Illinois and have about 6 of them in a cabinet -- just in case I ever run short . I 've turned at least 5 people onto it and now use it with chicken , pizza , and even eggs on a daily basis . It is exquisite and I 've very glad to have made its acquaintance .	1
I was afraid to try this stuff for a long time because Im not a lover of spicy food . Big mistake . This is a wonderful table condiment on a lot of things . I first tried it in Ramen now Im addicted , I ca n't eat Ramen without it now . Its not all that spicy when added as a table condiment , but is very flavorful . It has garlic , vinigar , salt and of course , Chili . Great on stir fries , rice and just about everything probably . Though Ive noticed if you cook with it , it gets spicier , almost too much , so be careful when cooking with it and go easy with it . Its much better as just a hot sauce you put on food at the table . I would recomend this to anyone who likes spicy food or hot sauce . Even if you 're not a lover of spicy food a little isnt that spicy and it makes things taste really good .	1
The first time I had this was at the local Chinese resturant.I saw it in the grocery store and now on Amazon.WOW ! ! ! HOT , HOT , HOT.Will make you eyes water and your nose run.Delicious with a little bit of tangyness to it.Recommended for chicken , burgers or as a dipping sauce.Also great on anything Chinese like General Tso 's chicken.Awesome sauce.Recommended .	1
Sit down boys and girls and let me tell you a story . Once upon a time , actually it was a Wednesday ; anyway , I decided to go on my lunch hour from work to the nearest Chinese buffet restaurant . I usually do not frequent the buffet lifestyle because I am afraid of what goes on behind closed doors , and the sneeze guard is just gross . I was happy to see that they had healthier fare to choose from , and sushi , so I filled my plate with steamed veggies , sushi and a dumpling or two . I sat down alone at my table , facing away from everyone because I just have this thing about people watching me eat , and something really brightly red caught my eye . It was in a Giant squeezy bottle , with a rooster on the front ; I picked it up and read the label `` Huy Fong Sriracha Hot Chili Sauce '' . Hmmm , a condiment that I have n't heard of , ME the so called Condiment Queen of Gainesville Florida . I squirted a bit on my plate , dipped my chopsticks in it and tasted it , GOOD LORD UP ABOVE , it was Huy Fong good , spicy garlicky vinegary so tasty , I then doused my entire meal with the HazMat red concoction and reveled in its goodness . I rushed out after work to the nearest Asian market , of which I frequent a lot , and there it was so many squeezy bottles how did I ever miss them before ? I grabbed three , plus two of my regular Hoi sin bottles , a jar of pickled ginger and proceeded to grin like a Cheshire cat to the register . On the bottle it also says its good on pizza , hamburgers , hot dogs , pasta and I have to admit the stuff is good on almost everything . I have used it on all of those things plus baked potatoes , in salad dressings , spaghetti sauce , barbecue , along side dips , its as if it mind melds with whatever it goes on to make a perfect accompaniment for your taste buds . Okay I am dorking out so that means this review is finished . BUY SOME NOW > you wo n't regret it .	1
Our family is made up of hot sauce fanatics . One entire shelf in the door of our fridge is lined almost entirely with various hot sauces . My husband is the worst culprit . While on vacation , he usually manages to find some new locally-made variety that makes the trip home with us.Out of ALL of this assortment , though , our hands-down favorite is Huy Fong Sriracha Hot Chili Sauce.Because we do like a `` hot '' hot sauce , we always dismiss the milder forms of this condiment . Some hot sauces are more of a watery , hot-vinegar taste . Others have SO much heat to them that flavor ca n't actually be determined ... all you can tell is that your mouth is on fire . That 's what we love about this sriracha sauce -- while hot , it also has a more interesting , full-flavor to it.The Huy Fong sriracha is made of a pur & eacute ; e of fresh red jalape & ntilde ; os , garlic powder , sugar , salt and vinegar . The first ingredient of many hot sauces is vinegar , or in some cases , even just water . The red jalapenos in this sriracha sauce are definitely hot , but with a bit of a fruity taste that is sweetened with the small amount of sugar it contains.It 's great as just a condiment on whatever food you like hot sauce on ( which , in our family , is most foods ) . It 's also a wonderful addition to many recipes . In a stir-fry , I 'll use this sriracha as part of my heat base in the sauce . A small amount added to a cream sauce or mayonnaise dressing adds a lot of zing.This Huy Fong Sriracha Hot Chili Sauce is generally found in the Top Ten in most published rankings of the best hot sauces ... and many times it is in first place . I 'd have to agree . This green-capped scorcher is # 1 in our home .	1
I tried this product after my daughter came back from camp and said everyone ate more of it than ketchup . They put it on everything.We were not disapointed and the price was better than the grocery store . Not so hot but tangy sweet / pepper blend that youcan easily control how much heat you want . Perfect for those who make wings at home but dont want Hot but a mild sweetasian flavor .	1
Whats not to like ? Hot spicy chili pepper sauce . This goes on pretty much anything you would put hot sauce on . I like it for pho soup but use it in almost everything to give things a little kick . Great stuff and cheap too .	1
Huy Fong `` Sriracha Hot Chili Sauce '' is offered in just about every Chinese and Vietnamese restaurant in my area , and with good reason ! Unlike at lot of hot sauces , this has a great chili pepper and garlic flavor that compliments most of the dishes I like ( particularly good on Pork Lo-Mein ) and also provides a good amount of spicy heat . This is not the hottest of the hot sauces but it is on the boarder line for several of my friend.This is really good stuff and we almost always keep a bottle of it on hand to liven up or cooking or when take-out does n't have enough `` zing '' . It is also great to spread on chicken when grilling but watch the smoke when opening the grill lid , it is like OC spray if it gets into your eyes.Highly Recommended ! CFH	1
Wonderful flavor , but a few drops is adequate . Nice Chiles used . My husband uses it where he would normally use hot sauce . I would recommend this as an alternative to any other hot chili sauce . I bought it because Cook 's Country recommended it on one of their taste testing segments on T.V . as the best chili taste . I agree .	1
Sriracha 's a great early morning pick-me-up on the ol omlet . It 's also great on pizza , stirfry , soups , panini sandwiches ( spritz a little atop the cheese the next time you make one , and see for yourself ) , etc . Great for livening up roasted red pepper hummus , tomato sauces , mayonnaise , you name it . The uses are innumerable.I 'm a self-avowed chili-head , and I 've tried more chili sauces than I can easily count . Everyone has their favorite styles and brands , and I 'm no different , because this happens to be one of mine.The thing I like about Sriracha is how the flavor and texture of freshly ground sun-ripened red chilies shine through cleanly ... there are no gritty/bitter seeds , no oxidized flavors from using reconstituted dried chilies , no caramelized/overcooked flavors , no competing heavy mismatched flavors/spices , no mouth pucking wretched excesses from being pickled in cider vinegar and salt , no fatiguing smoke flavors , no fruit juices , no excessive heat , no thermonuclear oil essence extracts , etc . Most of those things have their time , place and uses , and good examples of each abound ... but not here.No . Sriracha is just plain , beautiful , de-seeded , unobstructed , sun-ripened fresh red chili flesh , with just barely enough garlic , salt , vinegar and sugar to round it out , plus a little gaur gum to thicken it slightly , and a little sorbate for extend it 's freshness . That 's it . It 's pleasantly piquant , but not overly so.Highly recommended.p.s . A convenient fallback for me , whenever Sriracha is unavailable , is Franks RedHot Original .	1
I love hot and spicy , and I love hot sauce . I 'm the guy in the crowd who orders his food too hot for anyone else to share ... not to be antisocial , but because I like hot.I have a love/hate relationship with this Huy Fong Sriacha sauce.On the plus side : 1 ) Decent heat ; 2 ) Not vinegary ; 3 ) Pleasant flavor , not just hot ; 4 ) Super cheapOn the down side : 1 ) Not super heat ; 2 ) Second ingredient is sugar. # 2 on the down side is why I have the love/hate relationship . I wish this had less sugar in it . It 's not super sweet -- do n't get me wrong . But it 's sweeter than I would generally like , and for that reason , while it works great in some dishes , in others it adds some sweetness that 's unwelcome.The high sugar content is why I consider this to be , basically , Asian ketchup . Ketchup is tomatoes , sugar and vinegar . This is hot peppers , sugar , and vinegar ( with a bit of garlic ) . You would n't put ketchup on everything , even if you love ketchup on some things , and it 's the same with this stuff . And I think the places they do n't belong are pretty similar : Foods where the added sweet is not a plus.Anyway , I keep a bottle of this around for all the foods it DOES work well with . But I also keep my Mexican and American hot sauces around for the numerous foods where this is NOT the right choice .	1
I know , I was a loyal Frank 's , Cholula , Tabasco , habenaro sauce for years too . Then I read this article on this older Chinese gentleman who made it out of Vietnam in 1975 aboard a cargo ship named Huy Fung . When he arrived in Boston , he migrated to LA and joined the asain community there . he started making his signature sriracha sauce ( some folks call it Rooster sauce ) and walked around to the various restaurants and families and sold his sauce . Well , over the years , it took off like wild fire in LA . Next thing you know Wal-Mart wants it ! So you can get it at either Wally World or from Amazon for less if you are a Prime member . ( the Prime membership is worth it if you order more than 15x or so a year from Amazon- knowing your package will be on your doorstep in 48 hours is quite impressive ! ! ) So the Chinese gentleman , named his company after the cargo ship that brought him to the USA . He is up there in years and his son-in-law and him recently contracted for a new 650,000 sq.ft . facility to meet demand ! The label has a Rooster on the front ... ..The founder 's Chinese zodiac Rooster symbol and surrounded by the other Chinese zodiac symbols . The distinctive lime green top and the incredibly low price at Wally world or on Amazon -average $ 2.50 for 17 oz. ! ! of sauce ! ! The price crushes everything out there as does the flavor ... .a little bit goes a long way . With my cottage cheese I put a handful of walnuts over the cottage cheese and about 6 little drops of sriracha sauce , mix it in well , and it is delicious ! Enjoy !	1
Found in the grocery store for half the price . Great product , but not happy that i could have bought two for the pricethat was paid for one .	1
This is the best hot sauce I have found except for one thing . There is sugar in it , and I have to be on a sugar free diet , so I use Cholula ( especially Chili Garlic or Chili Lime ) a lot more.Still this is the best . If they came out with a sugar free version ( Splenda ? ) , I 'd be all over it .	1
Have learned to luuuuve this , especially on egg rolls ! Just hot enough to flavor any dish very nicely and very long lasting !	1
I found a recipe that called for this hot chili sauce . It is n't that hot but gives a nice zing to yourdish . My son loves & # 34 ; hot & # 34 ; and spicy foods and every time he comes to see me from AL anddinner is ready , he heads for the fridge and gets this chili sauce . It 's a rather big bottle , andwe will enjoy it for a very long time . It 's worth the try .	1
This one is a common sauce that most people are acquainted with . For the price is a nice addition to the kitchen , for it can raise the level heat from 0 to 60 in seconds flat . The more I cook , the larger the quantity of sauces that I need to transform conventional dishes into more interesting renditions . This one must be used sparingly for those who shy away from hot sauces , but for the crowd that likes it hot it will surely deliver a punch . Been around for a long time , and deserves a 4 Stars for longevity and performance .	1
My work colleague has definitely gotten my number . He knows I like things hot . ( He also likes to watch me sweat , but that 's another story ) . This was one of the Christmas presents he gave me.I have put this on just about everything , a ham and cheese melt , sausage , scrambled eggs , chicken , roasted peppers , mussels , clams , calamari , and most importantly in a Bloody Mary.It is also low maintenance . It comes in a plastic bottle and does n't need refrigeration . The lid opens by rotation similar to a plastic ketchup bottle.It is not terribly hot at 1,500 to 2,000 Scoville Units , but it enough to wet my scalp . I 'm definitely going to buy more of this . Why ? Because it 's hotsy totsy !	1
Very versatile , good in recipes , salads , or just slathered on fish , shrimp , or pork . And particularly good to juice up a Green Papaya Salad , on collard greens , or even in Hot n ' Sour soup . 5 Shrimp	1
Siracha is good as both a table condiment or use in cooking . It 's spicy , but flavorful , and a nice addition to a lot of dishes .	1
who does n't love it ? everyone loves the sauce , so i 'll talk about what i love : the bottle.red and green are eye-catching , and when paired with a rooster ( and hot sauce ) , do not make me think about xmas . and what a proud looking rooster ! and why would n't a sriracha rooster be proud ?	1
Nothing can compare to the rooster of hot sauce , very good in soups , salads , plain , chips , anything you can think of and you can even ask subway too !	1
My daughter loves anything hot , so I searched for something she could use here when she 's visiting . She certainly found out how hot Sriracha Hot Chili Sauce is . Right after I ordered this I read on aol mail that very soon you may not be able to buy Sriracha .	1
Wonderful , tasty chili sauce ! hard to find in stores , I was thrilled to find this on amazon . I first used this when I lived in California and have moved all over the country . Thank you Amazon for making this available at a great & # 34 ; add on price & # 34 ; .	1
I love the flavor of this chili sauce . It is not only hot and spicy , but it 's flavorful . I use it on just about everything ... .it makes my eggs taste great !	1
Once only found on Thai or Vietnamese restaurant tables , a bottle of Sriracha ( sree-RAH-cha ) Hot Chili Sauce is now a telltale sign of a great eatery , whether it be a sidewalk hot dog stand , a family hamburger joint or my favorite Asian restaurant.New York Journal News reporter Kara Newman provided some background about the condiment nicknamed `` Thai ketchup . '' Here 's an excerpt : [ [ The two most commonly-found brands are Huy Fong , which sports a white rooster on the label , and Shark . ( Supposedly , the shark is in homage to the shark-infested waters off the coast of Sriracha ) . Shark brand is made in Thailand and is used widely there as well as imported to U.S. stores and restaurants . Huy Fong is made in California by a Vietnamese immigrant , David Tran , and is the U.S . favorite . ] ] Sriracha is made of sun ripened chilies that are ground into a smooth paste with garlic . The sauce is nearly as thick as ketchup , which makes the squeeze bottle a handy way to deliver a spicy kick to your favorite foods . Speaking of ketchup , a little sriracha can add a nice kick to ketchup or your favorite dipping sauce without overpowering the other ingredients.Newman 's story featured recipes were adapted from Greg Gilbert , Jackson & Wheeler.Sriracha Remoulade1 cup mayonnaise1/4 cup sriracha2 tablespoons red wine vinegarWhisk together until smooth . Serve as a dipping sauce with fried calamari rings.Fried Calamari1/2 cup calamari1 cup milk1 cup flour1/2 cup semolinaVegetable oil for fryingSalt and pepperSoak calamari rings in milk for about 20 minutes ; drain.In a bowl , combine the flour and semolina . Dredge the calamari in the flour mixture , and shake off the excess . Heat the oil to 350 degrees , and fry the calamari until golden brown . Season with salt and pepper and serve with Sriracha Remoulade.Sriracha Spicy Buffalo Wings6 chicken wingsOil for frying3 tablespoons Frank 's Red Hot Sauce1 tablespoons sriracha1 tablespoons butter , softenedBaby mache or other lettuce to garnishFry the chicken wings until crispy . In a bowl , combine the red-hot sauce , sriracha , and butter . Toss the wings in the sauce and serve . Garnish with baby mache or other lettuceSriracha is also an excellent value . Amazon offers six 17-ounce bottles for about $ 20 , or less than 20 cents an ounce . That 's a lot of flavor for your dollar.In summary , I grew up with pepper , salt andTabasco pepper sauceon the table for breakfast , lunch and dinner . Did sriracha replace my bottle of Tabasco ? Yes . Sriracha is hotter but with a light , sweet finish that sets it apart from the vinegar tang of other pepper sauces.Rating : Five stars .	1
Huy Fong Sriracha Hot Chili Sauce is so often just the perfect zing to add to certain foods & that 's why it 's loved by many.One of my favorite uses for it is on shredded veggie tostados ~ for a great complement to things like that , try adding some Litehouse Freeze Dried Garlic sprinkles also ~ such a quick & easy burst of flavor while keeping it all simple & healthy .	1
I 'm a bit of spice hound and have flirted with other hot sauces before , but nothing has ever seized hold of me like Sriracha . An old Greenwich Village burger joint near where I worked at NYU used to serve it on the tables with popcorn and the combo was killer . The memory haunted me for years before I finally picked up a bottle . I should n't have waited . This stuff is amazingly addictive with a garlicky sweet hot yumminess that 's hard to describe . It sits on my table in front of the salt and pepper and I 've drained a bottle in a 3 month period . Incredible on eggs , superb on burritos , utterly transforms dull dietetic chicken vegitable dishes from the Chinese restaurant . I put a squirt in the health low-sodium soups instead of more salt and all of a sudden all the flavors perk up . Utterly highest recommendation .	1
This hot sauce has become a staple in my kitchen and replaced my bottle of Tabasco . Like Tabasco - it is primarily a hot ( cayenne ? ) pepper delivery device . A few drops add a considerable amount of heat to any dish . This is NOT a watered down hot sauce like Franks , etc.While Tabasco seems to impart mostly heat along with a heavy dose of vinegar - this sauce has far more subtle tastes going on beyond the heat , yet the heat is considerable and dominates . It also lingers , on your taste buds , longer than Tabasco . There is a subtle amount of sweetness to this sauce along with faint garlic notes . While Tabasco can taste quite harsh if you add too much to a dish -- -- this sauce , no matter how much you add , tastes fresh and just a bit sweet but of course can become far too hot if you add too much.I wanted to say in my review that this sauce had a hint of tomato yet there are no tomatoes listed on the ingredients . I suspect what I thought was tomato was simply the `` sun ripened chilies '' and the added sugar listed on the ingredients . But to be clear - heat - lingering heat - is the primary tasteWhile I really like this product and certainly recommend its purchase -- -- -- -- - I 'm not sure it rates 5 stars because the overall flavor does not seem TRULY exceptional - only VERY GOOD . There really is just one major taste evident and that is heat - and after that only a vague hint of something else which seems to be chiles , sugar and garlic . But chiles , sugar and garlic certainly beats ( by a very wide margin ) -- - the heavy vinegar aftertaste as evidenced in Tabasco and many other hot sauces.For the $ 5.99 I paid locally for a 28 Oz bottle -- - I 'm glad to always have it on hand and it is a true staple.Amazon prices the 17oz at $ 5.19 and the 27oz at $ 5.89 . It is a true no-brainer to purchase the 28oz size.As another reviewer recommended - given the potency of this stuff - you probably ONLY want to have a single bottle on hand . Larger quantities will deteriorate over time . I 'd recommend you purchase this locally and not in the 2/3/6 packs offered on Amazon . I doubt many households will go through a bottle in a year . As I said : this is potent stuff.Update ( July 2010 ) - a formal taste testI put 4 ounces of tomato juice into two glasses and progressively added 1/8 teaspoon of Tabasco or Huy Fong Sriracha into one of the two glasses until they both became too `` hot '' to tasteResults : With Tabasco - with each added dose the juice became not only hotter but harsher . With the Huy Fong - it became hotter yet retained a very fresh and sweeter noteUpdate ( August 2013 ) : While my review was written some time ago - just recently ( August , 2013 ) America 's Test Kitchen , a show on PBS tested a wide number of hot sauces . What sauce came in last ? Tabasco ! First was the Huy Fong Sriracha.Another Update : Bon Appetit magazine recently rated this sauce as `` ingredient of the year ''	1
This is n't the traditional Thai sriracha that 's more runny . But as far as bottled stuff this is what I grew up with . On Pho , stir fries , dipping sauces and so much more.It 's spicy but not overly spicy but I love things Thai hot . It is flavorful . My husband does n't like vinegar and while this has vinegar it 's not over powering.we always have an extra bottle in the pantry and one in the fridge we 're using	1
thats saying a lot coming from someone with an ulcer lol ... I cant eat any of my faves & actually a friend tipped me off about this wonder sauce , it does not leave me with a oily burpy heartburn after eating it . for those that LOVE HOT ! this is NOT fire hot stuff in my honest opinion ... its the flavor & that itty bitty touch of heat in the vapors as you breath depending how much you use of it ... I love it on noodles , pizza , eggs ... ect ... great great stuff ... my shopping cart has 6 more bottles in it to have on hand when hubby comes home off the road from his long haul driving job ... im sure he will steal a couple bottles to store on his 18 wheeler ! !	1
This is a great companion to my emergency `` tuna can '' lunches ! Spicy , hot , and a little sweet ! very tasty .	1
My hubby loves this hot chili sauce , it is hot and accents most flavors . It 's not too hot , just accents it nicely .	1
Southern born and never had any asian food until I joined the Army . Got married and my in-laws grew up on Japanese food . Needless to say within a short amount of time I was introduced to Siracha which I immediatley fell in love with . I was no means a virgin to hot sauce but this stuff rates up there with some of the best . It is now a staple in our house . We use it with egg rolls , gyozas , ramen mixed with soy sauce . Trust be you wont regret buying this stuff no matter where you are from .	1
What do n't I put this on . Marinades , salad dressings , eggs , steak , dunk my French fries in it . It is my go-to sauce .	1
This is hit with the family . Some have to have it on everything that they eat , It is really good with fish .	1
The best wish they made it with 0 Carbs thou but still very good .	1
I normally love extremely hot and spicy dishes , but sometimes I just want a mild kick with a lot of flavor . This sauce delivers . My primary use is on eggs or in some soups , but I also use this as a base for other sauces - some very spicy and some not.It 's difficult to communicate levels of spiciness in words , but I would put this at about half the heat of a jalapeno . Another comparison would be to Tabasco sauce - this one does not have the sour , overpowering taste of vinegar like Tabasco , nor the bite . It does , however , have a pleasant warmth that augments the flavor.One way I use this as a base is to saute some chopped shallots and garlic in olive oil , add crushed cashews , then four tablespoons of this sauce . I addHarissato increase the spiciness . Sometimes I will add chopped cilantro to the mixture , but the key to the flavor is this Sriracha sauce.This is also a perfect condiment to set out for guests who are adverse to overly spicy foods . Personally , I always have a bottle on hand and it usually does not last long . It 's one of the best condiments in my pantry .	1
Ok , sriracha being delicious is n't exactly a secret anymore . But if you 're here and looking at reviews I 'm guessing that you have n't had an opportunity to try it out yet . Sriracha , also known as `` rooster sauce '' because of the rooster on the green topped bottle , is a delicious hot chili sauce that works in many different ways . It is excellent for spicing up a dish in the kitchen . I use it in several different recipes to add a nice kick . In fact , my understanding is that Sriracha got its fame as restaurants discovered the product and starting using it in their recipes . It also works great as a condiment , and is slowly showing up on restaurant tables as the years go by . I 've come to the point where I 'll even dip my pizza in this stuff , it 's that good ! It might take you a few tries to learn what the right amount of sauce is for you to get that lip tingling boost to your favorite foods , but find it you will , and you wo n't regret the purchase . The bottom line is that your kitchen probably should n't be considered complete without a bottle of Sriracha present . It 's definitely something you need to try , and I would n't be surprised if it rises to the level of ketchup , mustard and mayo as something every American household has in the kitchen a few years down the road .	1
Got this for some recipes I am using and got a pleasant surprise . Flavor is off the charts . I now use a touch of this in my dressings , gravies and spreads . Just for the zing and a change up of flavors . Hubby is a hot sauce lover and he is thrilled with his morning steak and eggs , pizza and fries .	1
Hard to review such a subjective thing as hot sauce , but I do love this stuff . It has a really nice flavor and not killer spicy . It 's easy to try this stuff out since just about every Vietnamese restaurant in the country has it on all their tables .	1
I am not a fan of food that is hot just for hot 's sake : if it 's spicy it also has to be delicious , to have a purpose for the heat.I found this sauce adds a nice touch that even Tabasco does n't offer , it has a nice sweetness to it as well as a punch of heat . The heat is n't overwhelming or unbearable , it 's just a pleasant spicy addition to food .	1
This is a great sasuce for almost everything , thanks to its distinctive garlicky taste and just-right hotness , but as noted in prev . reviews , the larger ~30 ounce bottle of these are sold less than 5 $ in many NY delis , hoping that we 'll see similar , adjusted pricing on Amazon soon . Until then , I 'll keep buying it offline .	1
This has become a fave in my house . I usually despise hot sauce and opt for cooking with hot chiles and spices . This is different . It has none of that strange flavor of Tabasco and it really is hot unlike Frank 's Red Hot . You can truly taste the peppers . My hubby puts it on almost everything from tacos to eggs to empanadas and on and on . I just recently purchased the Sriracha cookbook and love it even more when used in cooking . Deviled eggs , spicy shrimp , and the best .wings ever made are thanks to this sauce . Delicious . And definitely cheaper in your local market . My supermarket does n't carry it but I can find it at my fruit store and at the Asian grocery for less than half of what it is priced here for . If you cant find it elsewhere it is definitely worth the extra cost because it is that good and because one bottle will last a long time .	1
This is habit forming . I do n't know what it is but I want to put it on everything . This morning I put it on scrambled eggs before I placed them in a tortilla . It is not `` just spicy . '' It has a great flavor and I can see me using it on so many things -- especially eggs that I used to put teriyaki sauce on . Unlike the garlic/chili sauce in the jar ( which is also wonderful ) this does n't burn your tongue off .	1
Not hot but close ! What it is is spicy . You can actually taste the flavor . Enhances any food you use it on . Buy it !	1
Sriracha , while hard to spell , makes everything taste better . It is spicy in a much better way than Tabasco and also better than most other western/Mexican style hot sauces . Tabasco is overrated by the way . Fact . Deal with it . If I may be allowed use an analogy in SAT form , it would probably look something like- Sriracha : Tabasco : : Philyodaddy : People who stand on the left side of an escalator . See what I did there ? Here is a list of things that are NOT made better by this Thai ( apparently its from Thailand , now I know ) delicacy : CerealFruitFruit-based desertsThat is all I got . Will update if I can think of anything else . Not likely.In addition to being great on cooked foods , it represents the single easiest way to prepare food . Pork , Chicken , Fish , just rub that red stuff all over it and put it in the pan/oven/Waring Pro DF280 Professional Deep Fryer , Brushed Stainless . Dinner for days . You 're welcome.All that being said , I would n't pay more than $ 3.99 for this bottle , making this current price a pretty bad deal . Certainly not deducting any stars though from this tremendous product . Go on with your bad self , Huy Fong .	1
I 'm not a fan of really spicy food so I use this sparingly . What I do use really adds a nice flavor to dishes . A bottle will last a long time but I will keep it on hand and consider it a staple .	1
I always keep this on hand to perk up everything from plain ramen noodles to tacos . It has just the right amount of heat . And unlike so many hot sauces that are all heat , you can actually taste the flavor of the peppers and other ingredients in it .	1
I love sriracha . I remember getting hooked on it in the Teriyaki houses in Kirkland , WA many years ago . I had n't had it for some time but recently purchased a bottle for nostalgia 's sake . I find myself putting it on everything -- scrambled eggs , pizza , spaghetti , Chinese food -- even in my morning grits on days when I need an extra urgency in my stride . : - ) It 's very good at imparting heat without that overpowering vinegar taste that other sauces impose . I ca n't imagine I 'll be without my bottle of Sriracha again anytime soon .	1
Had n't tried this until recently , but I 'm hooked now . Add it to anything to add some heat and more flavor . . . chili , stir-fry , soups , chicken dishes , etc . Try it .	1
Good price for the product . I received it very fast . Tasted great in the recipie I purchased it for . Would buy again .	1
Perfecto , reasonable price for one bottle ( and prime ! ) and saved me a bundle of time : it is spicy so try it in a small amount before squirting more . Has a direct 'hot ' flavor with little weird after taste . We add it to spice up a stir fry , in noodles , in ramen , hot dogs , dipping sauce ... Anything ! It is pretty good hotness .	1
Everyone who uses Sriracha Hot Chili Sauce knows why it gets five stars . I ca n't talk you into , just do it !	1
What 's there not to like ? This goes on everything and a pantry staple . Good price too for hot sauces which can be expensive ( for some reasons ) .	1
Okay , I know it 's not MADE for sinus troubles , but I swear . Every time my sinuses get stuffy , I fix myself some soup and add a healthy squirt of Sriracha sauce to it . My eyes start running , my nose starts running . Pretty soon , I can breathe again !	1
This is always a go-to for me when I 'm in the grocery store looking for something that 's a little spicy , but not TOO spicy . It boasts a fantastic flavor , a great consistency , and a very pleasant , mild burn.A lot of people comment that this is too hot for them , but I honestly do n't find it to be too hot . ( And I 'm usually not good with really spicy stuff ) I 'd consider it to be a more `` mild '' sauce , though for others , it 's probably in the medium range of heat . And unlike many sauces , where the burn stays with you for minutes on end after swallowing , this stuff pretty much stops burning within seconds of swallowing.The flavor is fantastic . A smooth , pleasant mix of sweetness and peppery tones . It gives a good kick of spice to any food . I particularly enjoy it on chicken and pizza . And neither the flavor or heat is overpowering . It compliments most foods very well , and can bring many dishes to a whole new level.I would very much highly recommend this sauce . Great flavor . Good , mild-to-medium burn . Good consistency . Cool bottle . ( Most people I know call it the `` Rooster Sauce . '' )	1
About the only thing I do n't put it on is icecream ! ! I will never go back to Tabasco sauce again ...	1
For years I 'd seen what I jokingly called the `` screaming chicken '' hot sauce out at various restaurants , but I was always too intimidated to try it , even though I love hot sauce . The mostly non-English labeling and contents made me think it was probably wicked hot . As with so many things I was put off by , I 'm kicking myself now that I 've tried it , as Sriracha sauce is n't that hot and in fact has a nice touch of sweetness to it that makes it a great addition to Thai and Chinese dishes . Truthfully it 's nowhere near as hot as Tabasco sauce and on the Scoville Scale of hotness it ranks only at the 1,000-2,5000 range making it medium ( Tabasco is the next level up ) . As a self-confessed hot-head hot sauce lover I have to admit Sriracha has a really unique consistency that is thicker than Tabasco , yet blends well in many Asian dishes . I typically love northern Thai food and Sriracha works well with it and with Szechwan as well . Sriracha gives a nice pop of hot without being overpowering like some hot sauces or the truly hot Thai chilies that rate up at 50,000-100,000 on the Scoville scale . If something is a bit too bland for my taste usually a bit of Sriracha gets my mouth watering . As I 've learned , if you like to spice things up ask your server about the sauces and chilies and try a small little sample , but do n't live in fear of hot sauces . Perhaps the best thing about Sriracha is it 's a known quality and consistent , unlike the bowls of sauces and chilies in some Asian restaurants ( believe me ... I 've had some that really took my breath away and I like it HOT ) . And certainly do n't be intimidated by the `` screaming chicken '' ; it might well become your new friend !	1
I have n't been able to find Red Rooster Siriracha in our little corner of the Ozarks . Once i recieved my bottle I understood why people like so much . Hot ( jalape & ntilde ; os ) , without being overpowering . It 's a keeper .	1
This is going to be a great hot sauce for recipes . A chef on the Dr. Oz show recommended this in a certain recipe . It has a pretty good kick to it .	1
We love this stuff and have been buying it regularly since 1988 way before the rest of the country discovered it . It gives a kick to any recipe and we love to mix it with ketchup for a kick to eating fries and burgers . Want a bit of spice in your life , this will do it for you and you do n't need much . It has heat and adds flavor while keeping it palatable.Overall , this is a great sauce to keep on hand in the kitchen .	1
This stuff is so good I think that mine had a hole in it ... I bought it and a week later it was gone . Darn evaporation .	1
perfect hot chilli sauce use for so many foods sandwichesgood repllacement for uses of ketchupshould it be refrigerated after opening ?	1
Absolutely delicious . On my eggs tasted like fresh truffles I 've had in Italy . I am ordering an ounce next time . I have to keep these in my pantry .	1
True story : I surfed online looking for difficult and expensive to find gourmet ingredients when I came across this listing . Every review raved about the excellent service provided by JR Mushrooms . I phoned them to ask a question about refrigeration vs shelf storage and got a voice-mail . I left a message and five minutes later the man himself personally called and gave me friendly and professional answers to my questions . I ordered these truffles and several other items . The next morning there was a little personal e-mail from JR thanking me for the order and by noon the order had arrived , although I chose the cheapest shipping . THIS is the best customer service I have ever experienced with on-line shopping . Thanks !	1
For that mushroomy goodness . I slice thinly and put in my lobster truffle mac n cheese . Also on flatbread along with truffle oil .	1
Not only are the truffles excellent , but the package arrived in record speed with standard shipping chosen . We are very pleased with our truffles and with our experience with this company . We will be ordering from them again !	1
This is a great price for the quality and quantity of vanilla in this bottle . I will continue to order it .	1
This product arrived in good condition and it is exactly what I was looking for , vanilla that is pure . No synthetic stuff .	1
Anything organic is good for me . This vanilla works well with all of my recipes and this is a good price . I also appreciate this company as they are trying to make this a better world by selling organic and giving some of their profits to good causes .	1
This stuff is great ! And so versatile ! You can put it in just about everything but be careful because too much and it is very overpowering . We use this all the time !	1
Great taste , i actually cute amount in half because this is a strong vanilla taste ! Great product ! Would buy again !	1
I love the quality and the price of this vanilla ! I was looking for an organic vanilla , as my family is phasing out chemical laden foods from out diets . I used this in baked goods , and the flavor is just perfect !	1
The organic vanilla is priced competitively , and a product I use frequently , Buying a larger amount at one time works for me .	1
This is a very mello vanilla . It helps in making some very tasty bake goods . Although , I have to make sure I keep the cap wiped off -- so the residue does n't build up and make it a challenge to remove the cap .	1
Delicious vanilla flavor that smells like pure gourmet vanilla . Highly recommend . I love that it is organic and no artificial ingredients .	1
What 's not to love ? Pure vanilla , grown without chemical pesticides and such . Yum ! I use it in all of my baking !	1
I 'll be honest , I do n't look for the `` organic '' label when I buy food . ( I 've got massive student loan bills to pay back so I try to cut costs wherever I can . ) But this vanilla extract was on sale at my local grocery store one day at a per-ounce price that made it competitive with the non-organic stuff . I 'm all about finding good unit prices ( and will stand there and do the math in my head to figure them out ) , so since I needed vanilla , I bought this . ( I do have limits -- I wo n't buy fake vanilla extract ! ) For real , organic vanilla extract , what you 'll pay on Amazon is competitive with what I 've seen on store shelves ( as of the date of writing of this review ) .I use this in all kinds of ways . I bake a lot , so it 's gone into cookies , cakes , frosting , muffins , quickbreads , and more . Sometimes I put just a bit in homemade yogurt ( after fermenting , as I do n't want any of the culture bacteria to get killed by the alcohol ) . I 've used it in pancakes and granola , as well . It provides a really nice flavor without being overpowering . The strength of the vanilla flavor is appropriate ( that is , you can use the amount your recipe specifies -- no need to double up or anything ) .If you are the type of shopper who is concerned about the environment , you should know that Simply Organic donates a percentage of sales to promoting organic agriculture -- this means fewer pesticides and less fertilizer runoff getting into the environment . Further , note that the bottle is glass instead of plastic ( the lid is metal with a lining ) , so you do n't have to worry about chemicals leaching from plastic and getting into your food . ( I do n't work for Simply Organic ; I just visited their website to see what kind of company they were . ) Also note that while some vanilla extracts contain a bit of sugar or sweetener , Simply Organic does not .	1
Ghirardelli Unsweetened Cocoa , 10 oz great product I always use Ghirardella chocolate product/Taste and quality you can always count on . My friends and family always compliment my chocolate baked goods	1
Who can argue with Ghiradelli ? As to be expected , this product lives up to the great producer 's name and reputation . If you 're looking for a fantastic product with bulk enough to always be available , this is an excellent choice .	1
Amazon ? Really ? $ 12.99 ? Is that a joke ? I just bought this same exact item at Whole Foods for $ 4.99 .	1
Chocolate sauce , cool & easy : Thoroughly whisk 1 1/2 cups nonfat plain yogurt , 1/4 cup half & half , 1/3 cup Ghirardelli Natural Unsweetened Cocoa and 1 tbsp sugar . Cover and refrigerate at least 20 min. , then whisk again before serving . Also try with 1/2 tsp organic orange oil.Serve with fresh apple slices , red grapes and walnuts to further enhance the nutritional benefits of the plain yogurt ( protein , probiotics ) and natural cocoa ( antioxidants ) ; include a slice of Teff 'n Stuff bread ( recipe posted online ) for gourmet presentation.After several years of recipe testing , this natural unsweetened cocoa powder remains my first choice of widely-available cocoa powders for chocolate-flavored recipes . The flavor is so rich and satisfying that selection was `` no contest '' for the Teff 'n Stuff Bread.Caution : Freeze this sauce overnight and you may be inspired to make your own frozen chocolate yogurt all the time ! Add a teaspoon of coffee crystals to the mixture for mocha flavor .	1
I bought these for my husband and was not crazy about them , I found they had a lot of additives , i rather go to whole foods and buy them in bulk .	1
If you love spicy food , you will not be disappointed . You will enjoy these peas . I know that I did . The package is pretty large so there is plenty to share .	1
great taste/price	1
Very good flavor and texture . These come in a bulk bag that I use to refill smaller containers . I love this as a snack food .	1
Handfulls of Wasabi Peas are great mid-day snacks for myself . My husband thinks they MAJOR open-up your sinus so he nearly sees stars . Personally I like that taste explosion .	1
While I must say that the quality and spiciness of the peas are amazing ( it has a nice horseradish-like spice , expected in eating wasabi ) , the packaging leaves little to be desired . Five pounds is a lot of weight to transport , and during shipment , it seems like my package went through a bit of a beating . While I was able to hash it out with Amazon 's CS team , I wanted to inform Hoosier Hill Farm to tighten up the packaging , or the peas will burst out of the bag ! The little tape-tie will not sustain 5 lbs of peas during transport.Even though this is the case , I wanted to note that the peas themselves are great . Please beef up the tie , or seal it better . It would change it from a 4-star product to a 5-star product .	1
There are only two of us in my household these days , so I was a little worried about ordering 5 lbs of Wasabi Peas . However , I worried needlessly ! These wasabi peas are so fresh and delicious that they 're nearly gone . I 'll be ordering again soon ! Very yummy !	1
I bought these for my husband after a friend introduced these to him . He loves & # 34 ; hot & # 34 ; foods and these are addictive for him . The fact that they are high in protein is a plus as his doctor wanted him to eat more protein . I will probably order another 5 # bag soon as he eats on this first bag several times a day !	1
Yes these are very hot . Snack on them and clear your sinuses quickly ! ! Not sure how you should use these in cooking . Going to experiment .	1
These are the best tasting wasabi peas I 've ever had . They are more hot than sweet , so if you like the sweeter tasting peas that typically come in cans , these are not for you . On the other hand , if like me you enjoy a hotter wasabi coating , you can not go wrong with these .	1
The product is as previously ordered . The intensity of the wasabi in the batches does vary . This batch was good but not the endorphine rush of the previous batch . The product was OK but I have been spoiled , in the past , and this was not the case here . I recommend these for the faint of heart .	1
This is the best value Wasabi peas out there . A 5lb bag represents a lot of peas - but leave 'em out at work and they 'll soon disappear ! Tasty .	1
I like them as a before dinner snack . Nice and crunchy and has a snappy flavor wan they definitely open up your sinuses . lol	1
These muffins have always been outstanding , but I have to say , this is the way to order them . Not just because they are sold in bulk , but because we found every package better than those from the stores . They were fresher , more perfectly round , and the muffins came apart by hand ( without having to be & # 34 ; fork-split. & # 34 ; ) Maybe it is because they come to the consumer directly from the manufacturer , but I also think that they are shipped very shortly after being baked . Think about it - they are n't transported by truck for who-knows-how-long ; they do n't sit in a store cooler for who-knows-how-long before being stocked in the store ; and so they do n't dry out . The plastic packaging is pretty thin , so over time , they will dry out . Worth the shipping cost . This time of year and up here in far north Michigan , I store the box in the garage , but would gladly store in my freezer in warm weather , ( extra protection by packing in 2-gal zip bags . ) Works great . If you like muffins as we do , try a box and let me know what you think . Makes great eggs benedict , or scrambled & # 34 ; egg muffins & # 34 ; with either bacon , ham or sausage patties and a slice of cheese . Are you hungry yet ? Quick , easy and exceptionally good on fresh muffins . Better than Mickey Dee 's .	1
Every once in a while my wife will pick up a box of English muffins and they are a good start to the day . She happened to pick up some Bays English muffins and she included them in our morning breakfast . She fried up a little bacon and an egg and grilled the muffins in a little butter on the hot plate . She made a bacon-egg-muffin sandwich that was the best we have ever had . The muffins were toasty and fresh and just wonderful.The muffins are also excellent when toasted and served with butter and honey or apple butter or jelly . They are a great way to start the day and I love them . They taste great and I recommend them to you .	1
I grew up in Kansas City , MO , so Wolferman 's English muffins were for a long time a staple in my home . I 've tried a lot of different muffin brands , from cheap store brands ( not worth the money ) to higher-end commercial brands . NOTHING beats these Bays muffins ! They 're not fork split -- they 're actually sliced , but that 's not necessarily a bad thing . They still have plenty of `` nooks and crannies '' for the melted butter due to the high-quality yeast they use . Pop 'em in the toaster , and you 'll get a nice crispy exterior and a chewy and flavorful interior . The flavor is wonderful -- just the right amount of yeastiness , but no `` sour '' taste . Great for breakfast with butter and a little marmalade or jam , but they also hold up well under heartier accompaniments or in sandwiches . The flavor still comes through.I made room in my refrigerator 's freezer for these , even giving up some ice cream room ! The sacrifice was worth it .	1
Bay 's English Muffins taste great and are so much easier to split thanThomas ' Original Nooks & Crannies 6 ct English Muffins 12 oz ( they come right apart ) . The secret to bringing out the flavor in a Bay 's English Muffin is to toast it until it 's really dark ... not burnt , just really dark .	1
Enjoy this alternative to English muffins if you 're on a wheat-free and gluten-free diet . They 're tasty and crispy when toasted .	1
It would be very difficult to cook most of the Japanese signature dishes without Mirin . Teriyaki without Mirin is flat and 'missing something & # 34 ; ; A stir fry without it is just not right . You really ca n't substitute it for anything else . This brand Kikkoman is very good . A must have kitchen staple for the serious cook .	1
I got this to make Eel sauce and have already used it . There is enough to last me for awhile .	1
I purchased this online and was quite happy with that purchase and the product . I have now discovered that while I might still consider purchasing it online , I will try my local grocer first because they now carry it ( same brand , w/out shipping and handling prices ) on their shelves . I ca n't say enough about the product itself , however . Makes an absolutely great cabbage slaw .	1
Mirin andSoy Sauce . That is all you really need for authentic Japanese cooking . And you need it everywhere . Those two liquids are the foundation for almost all recipes , and are used in some quantity in every dish . I do a considerable amount of Japanese cooking , and running out of mirin sends me into panic mode and heading out to the store.Do n't be fooled into thinking that `` teriyaki sauce '' has anything with Japanese cuisine . Purely an American invention , true teriyaki cooking is a combination of mirin and soy sauce , based on the meat or vegetables which are then slowly cooked , rotating sides until they become a delicious brown sticky mess . It is sooo much better than the fast food restaurants try to pass off as `` Japanese teriyaki '' .When it comes to brands , it is hard to go wrong with Kikkoman . For both mirin and soy sauce , they put out a consistently good product that you can count on to enhance your cooking . There are probably more refined and expensive brands out there , but Kikkoman does me just fine , as it does for the millions of Japanese households where it sees daily use.As a sweetened wine , mirin adds flavor as well as nutrients to a dish , and can even be used as a sugar substitute in some recipes for those trying to escape from refined white sugar . Check outJapanese Foods That Healfor an in-depth discussion on mirin 's health benefits and uses .	1
it is amazing the difference in a quality product , when cooking you can really taste the difference . Will never buy any other sweet cooking rice wine .	1
At first I did n't understand why it costs so much when I first started cooking Japanese food , but when I started making the meals I saw how often it was used and how great it was . I really love Mirin ! ! XD	1
This makes my brown rice taste good , which means I eat more of it . This is great stuff ; just add this and a dash of soy sauce to short grain brown rice : )	1
If you love oriental food and want to cook it a home , this will be your friend . Really good stuff .	1
This mirin is satisfactory for use in Asian dishes and the real mirin is hard to locate in my area . I would suggest using real mirin if you can find it at a local Asian market .	1
Son who is a culinary student at the art inst . is loving all the things that I buy to cook with . We are now cooking things fron asia .	1
Sesame oil is a mainstay in my diet . I use it whenever I saute something with meat or chicken , on burgers , in stir fries , on brown rice , etc , usually in concert with Tamari . It just adds delicious nuttiness to anything.This is a good product competitively priced compared to retail , and I love the convenience of getting it on amazon .	1
This is a good grocery for us.If you cook something , you can use it.It is smells so good.You should buy it .	1
Without a doubt this is the best sesame seed oil on the market . I 've had to go to the 56oz cans because my family uses it to cook with , put on salads & anything else they can think of . If you just try it in your stir fry or fried rice , you 'll never buy the other brands again .	1
Kadoya Sesame Oil is delicious , with a deep , dark , full sesame taste . Unlike many sesame oils which are watered down , this one is the real thing . Great for all Asian-style cooking .	1
This oil is fantastic for many great tasting recipes and for Asian cooking in general . Also this oil seems to withstand high heat without burning . In my house we use it all the time for many different dishes . Sesame oil contains vitamin E which is an anti-oxidant . This means it helps lower your cholesterol.I like to cut up broccoli , peppers ( green and red ) , brussel sprouts and a chicken breast . Then I add soy sauce , hot sauce , ginger & garlic paste , water and of course sesame oil . You only need a little sesame oil . Less is better here because if you put too much the sesame oil will overpower the other flavors . A teaspoon or a little less is just right . This makes a quick tasty meal when mixed and stirred in a hot pan on high heat . It only takes about 10 minutes and serves at least 2 people . Very simple and quick meal that tastes great with sesame oil.I 'm sure there are loads of tasty sesame oil recipes . All you have to do is search the internet and you 'll be busy for hours if you like to cook . The main thing is to use it sparingly . This oil is dark , rich and very tasty .	1
This is extremely potent . You only need a couple drops in a big pan of stir fry and you 'll taste it in there . I 'd buy it again .	1
Ajinomoto - Hon Dashi ( Soup Stock ) 5.28 Oz.You HAVE to use this for all your oriental style cooking . This is the real stuff .	1
I love green tea , I love Kit Kats , but the two do not belong together . I hate the after taste of them .	-1
This product is no where near natural / organic-I only wish I had seen the other reviews before purchasing ! It contains all the things I did not want-which is why I was looking for a natural alternative . They need to have an ingredient list on here to avoid this ... I am & # 34 ; returning & # 34 ; item . I am trying to avoid my children 's exposure to yellow 5 , red 40 and so on ... I do not understand how they can still make these things knowing what they can cause . This may be fine for someone that does n't read labels or care what their kids eat-but not for my family .	-1
Licorice is my favorite candy , and it promotes good digestion . Since I have some digestive issues , I eat licorice on a regular basis . I 've tried basically every brand . I bought this because it 's advertised as soft licorice . However , it is the same consistency as the cheapest stuff on the grocery store shelf ; the difference is that this has a stronger flavor . The flavor is nice . The consistency and texture is terrible . I bought another package hoping the first was just old/stale , but the next package was the same . I threw away both packages .	-1
This is an awesome product , natural , not a lot of ingredients , good flavor , not too sweet.But I no longer love our scaredy-cat friends at Amazon ! : PNow they wo n't let you write honest reviews of the product , so lame.What 's insane is the price ! I can easily get this same thing at the grocery store for 1/3 to 1/2 the price ( not even on sale ) .But here it 's at a greatly inflated rate AND they 've made it an `` add-on '' item - shameful.Add-on is the worst new `` feature '' I 've seen in the many , many years that I 've been shopping at this site.I am a Prime member & signed up for that so I could get FREE shipping on ANY item at ANY time - not so I would STILL have to group items into $ 25 & higher orders . Pathetic . Way to go Amazon . : PBUT - this is ABSOLUTELY the best licorice out there ! Just be careful if you have high blood pressure : it uses real licorice as the main flavoring & licorice root can increase a person 's blood pressure.OK , Amazon , will you chicken out & block my review again ? ?	-1
As soon as I had a couple of sips , my eczema started uncontrollably itching . That 's one of the signs when something I eat is NOT gluten-free . Will return the item for a refund .	-1
No way would I put the vast majority of the ingredients in these 'spice ' packs in my body.. As you know the list of the amount of anything in a product starts with the item it contains the most of and then the next most etc . Try this for heart healthy , : Dextrose , sugar , salt , spices ( does n't say which ones ) hickory smoke flavor , MSG , hyrolyzed soy protein , dehydrated onion , dehydrated garlic , less than 2 % of caramel color ( what the heck for ? ? ) , silicon dioxide and calcium silicate ( anti-caking ) . Then they list Cure ingredients : - salt ( like they need more ) and sodium nitrite ( 0.62^ ) .As far as I 'm concerned , this product should either come with a warning that it 's not heart healthy or be taken off the market entirely . I 'm sure I can come up with practically the same taste without adding the junk . Do n't know if it 's worth bothering to send back but I sure wo n't be using it .	-1
this stuff is a poor example of an authentic 5-spice powder which I paid $ 1.5 for 4oz locally , despite the fact that other Dynasty products are useful such as their Satay sauce . I live walking distance to Flushing Queens , and have a good idea what it 's supposed to taste like from authentic Asian cooking sold nearby . If you want to go cheap off Amazon , you are better off withFrontier Five Spice Powder , 1.92-Ounce Bottle . BTW `` star anise '' or `` aniseed '' is already a licorice flavor , so to add even more licorice to this bottle was foolish .	-1
I was aboslutely shocked to see how much 1 oz really was . At $ 7.60 , I mistakenly assumed it would be a decent sized can . As locally I am able to buy a medium sized tube of wasabi paste for around $ 3 , but never used it fast enough so it would get old . I figured a powder would be better , so I can mix it as I needed it . When I opened the box and dug thru the packing and saw this little little can , I started looking for the hidden cameras ... thought this HAD to be a joke . Nope .. and it 's NOT returnable either . SO I HAVE LEARNED MY LESSON . Please just be aware if you should decide you want this EXPENSIVE wasabi powder .	-1
unsure if I just got a bad batch or what ... the flavor has been bland and never builds to the expected pop of wasabi ... followed the directions exactly , but just did n't get the results I was hoping for	-1
Mother and I started drinking this back in the 1980 's . I stopped because it was causing me too much pain , slightly worse than menstrual cramps . The herbs in this tea are strong . I think I read somewhere where the Senna in this stimulates the bowels to contract . This is n't really a weight loss product but more a laxative .	-1
With its new-look packaging , Tazo also reformulated the Awake tea blend . The old blend was strong , robust , and biting . It was by far my favorite bagged black tea . The new blend is weaker and maltier ; it is sadly reminiscent of standard Lipton tea . If I want Lipton tea , I 'll buy Lipton tea ; it 's a lot cheaper than Tazo.I know that many people found the old blend to be too bitter . Tazo apparently decided that they 'd gain more customers than they 'd lose if they toned down the flavor . I do n't know if they 're right , but they 've definitely lost me .	-1
This brand of tea felt stronger in the past . Now it feels more ordinary.Relative to other teas I have consumed , this one has no flavor whatsoever . It is not even Organic , but that 's okay as it was never advertised as such.I will not be buying it again .	-1
The product description says that this tea is 'slightly sweet ' as well as a bunch of other descriptors , but I did n't get any sweetness at all . I was very optimistic because I normally love everything Tazo offers , but this time I had my hopes dashed.I brewed up a mug of this tea and was immediately alarmed at the bouquet . The teabag smelled different , but once the hot water hit it the smell seemed to really magnify . But I scooped in a few teaspoons of sugar and hoped for the best . I managed to choke down about a third of the cup before I called it a day . Life is too short to drink something you do n't like.However , I had read a review that mentioned how good and palatable this tea was when combined with the Tazo Lotus . I figured it was worth a shot , otherwise I 'd have to throw out this tea altogether.The Lotus smelled great , so I was excited . I blended the two bags ( one Lotus and one Wild Sweet Orange ) in a large mug , then removed the Wild Sweet Orange after a minute . I left the Lotus in for another minute or two ( yeah , definitely two ) .The result was a very unusual , but not unappealing , beverage . Would I drink this more than once a day ? No . Was it very interesting and something that I 'll try again ? Yes.Live and learn , I guess .	-1
I got two bags of this tea in a Tazo tea sampler box.Brewing it , it smells pretty intense . Drinking it , it tastes pretty intense . A very strong sour citrus flavor , coupled with an inexplicable slightly gelatinous texture . After a few sips I decided that I did not care for it as it was , and added some powdered non-dairy creamer to the mix , to see if that improved anything.The creamer did not dissolve well in the tea , but rather , it coagulated into little clumps , making the already-odd texture of the tea even more odd , and not improving the flavor in any significant way.Perhaps the moral of the story is that I do not like orange-flavored tea , but I found this particular orange tea to be unpleasant beyond my expectations .	-1
Misleading . The reason this is cheaper than the other flavors is that this is a 12 pack , whereas the others are all 24 packs for around $ 21 . Beware of misleading listings.Also , the cinnamint is probably the weakest flavor . Even fresh packs ( I can tell because of the dates of promotions on the package they sometimes run ) can sometimes taste stale . This is because the flavor of the cinnamint lasts just a few minutes . Tasting all flavors , the peppermint by far outlasts this flavor and most of the others . I highly recommend that flavor for a nice breath refresher between brushings or just after meals.Orbit Peppermint Sugarfree Gum , 14-Piece Packs ( Pack of 24 )	-1
I received the tree today , and when i got it out of the package it had small bugs crawling around everywhere ... I decided to go to my local nursury and i found some bonsai tree 's that looked better and were alot cheaper .	-1
Well , I guess I 'm the fly in this reviewer ointment , but Dave 's is the only hotsauce that I wo n't buy . It has a synthetic quality to it and a flavor that is almost non-existent . This is due to its being made directly from capsaicin extract as opposed to actual peppers . It offers a nuclear level of heat that seems to be a recipe for ulcers in my opinion . According to Wikipedia , its Scoville heat ( fire ) index rates out 50,000 units which can be contrasted with Tobasco 's 2,500 to 5,000 rating . Who needs that much heat ? Not me or most human beings . This stuff is lethal . No thanks .	-1
O.k. , I 'm going to offer a counterpoint to all the positive reviews . I did not like this hot sauce , and I like hot sauce ! This may be good in chili ( and I will try it there as soon as I get a chance ) , but it is not a general hot sauce for your eggs , soup , sandwiches , whatever.It is very thick and has the consistency of tomato paste . The heat is derived from peppers and `` pepper extracts '' ( read : capsaicin ) .If you want flavorful heat you can use everywhere , try somewhere else . I recommend Melinda 's Naga Jolokia for one .	-1
I just tried this sauce moments ago . Someone had brought some in to work and it was being passed around . I love hot food , so I figured I might as well try it . I have not explored any exotic peppers or sauces - just the usual jalapeno , habanero , cayenne , and other ordinary peppers . I 'm no expert and would never claim to be , just to be clear . My initial impression of this sauce was `` yuck '' because it was so bitter and metallic and unpleasant to me . It is hot , yes , but not OMG-I'm-dying hot . Just ... hot , and with a flavor-if you can call it that-I would not want on my food . Also , the heat lasted only about five minutes or so , without me even drinking anything .	-1
Buyer Beware Please ! This sweetener is not for everybody . Maltitol is an alcohol sugar and can be undigestible in the body . You will know a short time after consuming it if you are one of the unsuspecting many who can not digest it by the extreme intestinal bloating and cramping and massive amounts of gas a person can experience . Nausea , diarrhea & headaches can also be experienced . I learned my lesson the hard way years ago when I fell in love with the sugar-free chocolates suzanne sommers used to sell . I thought I 'd found sugar-free chocolate nirvana at first taste but the bliss was short lived when the terrible side effects of maltitol kicked in . The discomfort was unlike anything I had ever felt before . I blew up like a balloon and had very painful abdominal cramping . As the symptoms passed , this too was very unpleasant . Though hard for me to believe a low calorie sweetener could be the culprit , all symptoms were gone when I stopped eating the chocolate . My hunch it had something to do with the maltitol were unfortunately confirmed for me about a year later when I purchased some delicious sugar-free popcorn at my local market . The taste was amazing and while I was looking at the label wondering what could possibly make this yummy , new sugarfree treat taste so good , my heart sank when I followed the little asterisk next to sugarfree sweetener* down to the very bottom of the label and read `` maltitol '' in tiny little letters ! Thank goodness I 'd eaten only a little . I still ended up with all the same side-effects but for a much shorter duration . Some people can use maltitol to their heart 's content but others , like me , can have a bad reaction to it . In case you 're like me , ... it 's not you ... it 's the maltitol !	-1
Perhaps the best coffee is in the US if this is any example . Not really fond of chickory but felt it was worth the try . Does n't taste like coffee to me - but maybe should be called something else - something weak and not flavorful .	-1

When I was incarcerated in a Mexican prison , this was the only drink in the joint . We had to fix it with goat 's milk and heat it over an open flame in the yard . The taste is awful . It 's not pleasing like the thick , hot Chocolate found in Madrid .	-1

I got this a few months ago with high hopes but it was barely OK , kind of grainy , did not dissolve in milk .	-1
For quite some time , I have been using different types of hot sauce on different types of food . Before I started doing this , I only ever remember using hot sauce on barbeque sandwiches . Even though I have tried numerous types of hot sauce during this period , El Yucateco has set itself apart from the others as being one that I do not care for . It is overpoweringly hot -- with a searing heat -- and has an odd , unenjoyable flavor . Although not a terrible hot sauce -- I consumed the entire bottle -- El Yucateco is a hot sauce that I am glad that I tried , but it just is not my thing .	-1
This was by far my favorite hot sauce until the University of Nevada at Las Vegas released a study identifying this brand as having 0.21 PPM of lead in it along with others - FDA limit for lead in food is 0.1 PPM . It got some publicity so do a search for `` hot sauce lead '' to read up . Aside from the lead , the use of artificial colors also bugged me . The study concludes that simple adjustments to the manufacturing process , such as washing the peppers , or not using salt from the earth , but rather the sea could remedy the problem altogether . If they 're not even washing the peppers before processing them , then they are probably covered in pesticides as well .	-1

Low quality and low flavor hot sauce ... .not all that hot either.If you need some hot sauce and have nothing else around , then this will do , but that there are so many other choices , this is the worst choice to make . Even regular tobasco sauce is much much better.I can only describe it as being similar to watery taco bell sauce.I would recommend Frontera Hot Sauce , Tobasco , or Cholula Hot sauce over this .	-1
I would have liked these if the seller had taken better care of the product or maybe it was that one unseasonably warm spring day in San Francisco ... The tin is large and comes with a card describing each kind of chocolate .	-1
If you think your going to get that awesome full flavor and aroma you bought in a coffee shop in Kona forget it . If you add the cost of this stuff ( Hawaii Rosters ) you can do better . It 's just OK and is not worth the price IMO .	-1
i had always heard about kona coffee and finally decided to try it.these beans were dry with no noticeable oil.as such the coffee was bland and lifelessi havent tried kona coffee since ; good luck ! ! ! 2/5	-1
This product is very misleading . The bottle states it is pure vanilla bean paste when in fact it is sugar , water , vanilla extract and a thickener added to it . The result is a very sweet vanilla flavored sugar paste . This is not usable for all cooking and absolutely can not be used for anyone prepping food/drinks for someone with blood-sugar issues . This product should be removed from Amazon until the description is updated with the exact ingredients along with its nutritional information .	-1
i used to buy these all the time , but I moved and could no longer find them at the grocery . I was excited to see them on amazon warehouse deals , but they arrived very stale . Maybe I just do n't get warehouse deals and it was supposed to taste horrible ? That seems wrong . Also somewhat different flavor and packaging than I remember years ago at the grocery .	-1
Imagine the horror my son felt as he unwrapped his Christmas present to find this bloody carcass instead of a plush toy . It is NOT fuzzy although it is pink ... .sorta . More like a greenish red color . There was a stench too ! Now THIS after Hostess took away his twinkies ( Amazon has been wheeling & dealing in $ 500 a box Twinkies , so they must be in cahoots with Hostess ) . This has contributed to his anxiety , which means MORE XANAX to tone that boy down . Very very hard for a 42 yr. old boy to deal with ! He did say , however , that it DOES taste like chicken . An icy cold glass of Tuscan milk makes it perfect .	-1
I 'm hopping mad just seeing this . We should all paws for a second , and lettuce think about this . Would n't you really just rather have a chicken ? I 'm all ears if someone disagrees .	-1
So I thought fresh meant I could eat it out of the box , much like I would fresh apples and pears . Apparently not . After devouring three pounds of fresh whole rabbit out of the box , I have spent the last week in the hospital . Be sure to read the instructions . Apparently you have to cook the rabbit .	-1
Well , I ca n't speak for others who may have had a different experience , but myFresh Whole Rabbitdid NOT arrive whole . No head , no entrails , no paws . For just a few dollars more I could have purchased a fully intact one at my local pet store . Granted , I did go with the `` Buy it Used '' option , to save a few bucks , which may account for some of the wear-and-tear . Buyer beware .	-1
Decent texture and freshness but there is a noticeably industrial taste and aroma . Will not buy again - bargain or not.Returned them and bought Twizzlers which are reliably the better red licorice .	-1
I 'm a tea LOVER . I hate to bring the reviews down here , but I could n't passed the intense sour taste . Sorry , tea .	-1
This may be good for you but it taste awful to me ! Wo n't be buying this again . Very yucky taste ! !	-1
Stale , tastless crap . Dont bother . The hassle to return is riduclous , you have to pay and it has to be thrown out anyway , Why put customer thru all this for cheap little item .	-1
I read where Dandelion tea could help with weight loss . Whether or not that is true I ca n't atest . After reading some of the potential side affects of drinking dandelion tea , I decided it was not for me and tossed it out .	-1
I bought this on a lightning deal and am very disappointed . If you want ( bagged ) high quality chamomile tea , stick to all-flowers , high-quality potent Traditional Medicinals brand . This produced-going by their exact instructions and a couple of variations-a browner tea than pure chamomile flowers produce ( darker in this case does NOT mean potent-chamomile is golden and it should only ever become a more saturated yellow if steeped at rich concentrations , never even approaching brown or apple cider type coloration ) , and just as crucially it tasted more twiggy and was far less aromatic with nearly none of the sweet apple-cherimoya tastes than any good chamomile.While I do tend to brew loose tea & am ; picky about the actual bags used by any given brand ( chemical bleaching will destroy all tea ) , bags are nearly essential when my time to get tea is limited to pouring water over the tea and covering it to steep at my work area and another ten seconds to squeeze the bag out and toss the tea . Still , I wo n't be taking this anywhere-the two unused boxes will go to a food bank since I 'm sure someone will appreciate it if only as something hot and free of caffeine . Frankly , Celestial Seasonings makes tea better than the two Alvita single-ingredient options I purchased.One thing I tend to do with every new tea try is analyze the actual tea itself , always wet but often dry as well . This one 's prominence of stems ( a 1.5cm one punctured the bag in pushing out the liquid with a spoon against the little ramekin lid I cover my cups with ) , the dusty brown flecks of what I presume are chamomile flowers-very poorly handled ones ! -and the end result leave me writing a review urging you to go elsewhere . If you want bagged tea , Traditional Medicinals ' chamomile -- which is all flower , twice as flavor ( and nutrient ) -rich as Alvita gram for gram , and can be steeped essentially indefinitely ( til the bag breaks down ) without becoming bitter , which is true of nearly all pure chamomile ( that is n't treated with pesticides or in treated bags etc ) , especially Egyptian varieties -- is so far the best I 've found . Two bags of this can not compete with ONE of theirs and if you steep Alvita beyond a few minutes your tea will be bitter and woody-tannins and other bitter components are from the stems , not the flower.If you are able and willing to do the extra minute of work , getting loose WHOLE Egyptian chamomile flowers whose quality you can visibly assess ( including how long they 've been sitting around ) is by far your best bet-cheapest , too , and a Chinese tea gallery can sell you a cute little handled double-layer mesh strainer for a few dollars-I personally use my Pyrex measuring cups to steep so I can easily pour the golden ( in this case-iodine red or kiwi green or whatever other shade it turns out ) liquid into my drinking vessel and if the ingredients are suited to multiple steepings like oolong or pu'ehr steep again without too much awkwardness.The tl ; dr essence of this : look elsewhere-this is extremely poor chamomile , whether you ask me , a diligent grower , or an expert-this is not advertised as twiggy tea ( it 'd be the wrong component anyway ) and you likely are n't looking for an infusion from taking boiling water to hay-like splintery stems . For shame , Alvita . For shame.Try this instead : [ [ B0009F3PM6 : Traditional Medicinals Organic , Chamomile , 16-Count Boxes ( Pack of 6 ) ] ] You wo n't regret it .	-1
I have some digestive issues and this tea did not do trick . A little disappointed . Do n't waste your money on it . Tastes so so .	-1
if you have misgivings about magnesium stearate , do n't buy this product . it 's a white powder packed with the tea bags that you need to do your research on before you decide about it . i have decided against it after reading various diverse views .	-1
I love parsley and add it to my cooking all the time . I thought I 'd like this tea but unfortunately , I was mistaken .	-1
I did n't have such luck with this product as the other reviewers -- unfortunately I got SEVERE abdominal cramps the few times I tried it . Still , it 's worth a try because it works for many people . Just bear in mind that if you get some bad cramping , you are probably sensitive to SENNA , the active ingredient in the tea . So stay away from other SENNA products , too . ( usually labeled `` Stimulant Laxative . `` ) So what works for me ? Lots of the high-fiber foods every day . Plenty of raw fruits ( except banana ) and vegetables ( two raw carrots a day works wonders ! ) Whole grains every day makes a big difference -- I especially like brown rice and oatmeal . Apples are yummy : I eat one every day . Eating beans and legumes is also very helpful . Buy some dried lentils -- they cook the fastest -- and google some soup recipes . And keep products made with white flour to a minimum.In the worst case scenario , try plain old water . Both ways.Nature is great .	-1
I hate the new version which is watered down with chamomile and not effective at all ! The previous senna one was extremely effective but NO longer available at all . I stopped buying it as soon as the company added chamomile and it is now useless . Why do companies change something that already worked in the freakin first place . What a shame . The box they show on this is the old one but I bet if I ordered it they would send me that crappy new stuff . Also Amazon needs to offer a Zero star option as that is what I would give this new version-a big fat zero .	-1
This is refined not unrefined . How amazing , the seller will not provide the proper images of the product after complaint . I had to return due to misrepresentation by the seller.Spectrum is an organic producer which sells refined as well as unrefined VCO in many different labellings , different containers , glass to plastic . Spectrum VCO are identified as Essentials but for cooking it is identified as Naturals.I use VCO in the mix for my hair , shaving cream , soap , hand lotion , face lotion , body lotion , tooth paste as well as I make popcorn and consume it straight out of the jar for its nutrients . Years ago , I was able to get raw , hand pressed coconut oils from fresh coconuts from Mexico produced right here in US but due to popularity of VCOs , many producers have been creative in making money by misleading shoppers as well as many misleading reviews by shoppers certainly has hyped the business of VCO to another level . Extra Virgin Coconut Oil is a lie since Extra Virgin applies only to olive oil and infact the VCO market has become so saturated that many producers are removing extra from their labeling and calling it virgin coconut oil , no more extra virgin . In Canada where the best VCOs are produced , it is illegal to even use the term , extra virgin for coconut oil but in US the laws are very relaxed . There is no Extra Virgin coconut oil , only virgin , there is no pure , no # 1 , no 100 % , no premium liquid , or any of those terms used for coconut oils . There is no coconut oil especially produced for beauty product which is any different than for cooking or consumption either as a salad dressing or right out of the jar with a spoon . The higher the grade , the higher the nutrients , everything else are marketing tools to sell coconut oil for more money.REFINED or UNREFINED : The decision to choose between refined vs. unrefined is dependent upon the intention or use of the oil . Unrefined coconut oil has a smoke point of 280 degrees Fahrenheit , whereas , refined coconut oil 's smoke point is 365 degrees Fahrenheit making it great for high heat cooking or saut & eacute ; ing.GRADE A : Unfiltered , Fair Trade , Certified organic by the USDA , Canada Organic , BC Certified Organic , Ecocert , first pressed VCO and Kosher . Hand pressed and cold-pressed to produce raw oil from fresh coconuts in as little as two hours.GRADE B : Unfiltered , Fair Trade , Certified organic by the USDA , Kosher , cold-pressed from fresh coconuts . Unknown if first pressed , Not Ecocert , Not raw oil produced in couple hours or less like Grade A.GRADE C : Unfiltered , Certified organic by the USDA , Kosher , cold-pressed from fresh coconuts . Unknown if first pressed , Not Fair Trade , Not Ecocert , Not raw oil produced in couple hours or less like Grade A.GRADE D : Unfiltered , Certified organic by the USDA , Kosher , cold-pressing/expeller pressing . Unknown if first pressed , Not Fair Trade , Not Ecocert , Not from fresh coconuts but from copra , Not raw oil produced in couple hours or less like Grade A .	-1
I had read in a health magazine that Fenugreek was a product that could help enlarge the breasts . I did n't even get to a point with prolonged use to dicover if that was true because these pills had such a funny taste to them , and if you do n't eat right away or right before you feel very sick , and still , sometimes after eating you 'll feel sick . Purhaps it was the size or the dose	-1
I was taking Fenugreek along with Alfalfa and mothers milk tea for months to increase my supply and I the combo had . Then my baby became very gassy and making our lives miserable . I suspected everything from my food to the supplements . I tried cutting different foods then reintroducing them and no change . Finally I decidedvto read up in the supplements and found that in 20 % of babies Fenugreek causes gas and/or fussiness.So the next day I stopped taking it . Now 1 week has passed and not only has my baby 's gassiness gone away I oddly feel that I have more milk.I 'm sure this works for some so ca n't say it 's bad . Just be aware that this can happen .	-1
Since I 'm on a limited income , I look for the best price I can get , and I make a lot of things from scratch . Also , I love sugar-free `` jello '' , and that is a primary reason I have gelatin , although I do use it for some other things . This looked like a quality product at a good price . Boy , was I wrong ! To get anything to set up , it takes at least DOUBLE the amount of gelatin than it does with Knox gelatin . So much for savings . It does not dissolve to a clear solution , but has a brownish tinge to it . This may be okay for things that have enough color to mask it , but not for light stuff . If you use enough to get your solution to jell , the texture is poor and rubbery . Frankly , I can find nothing whatever to recommend this product . I 'm going back to Knox .	-1
First let me just say..I thought about this before I wrote this review , after taking things into consideration I decided since my satisfaction was a total disregard in the first place I think I should warn people prior to their purchase.when I received my package EVERYTHING in the box was dripping in honey & might I add ( ( NOT CHEAP ) ) honey at that ! ! I bought 2 jars of this honey & they were both destroyed when they came . The boxes of Tea I purchased were also in the box with the jars & were sloshing in the broken glass jars of honey as well..Why buy glass jars of anything if it comes busted ? ? ? I have purchased many items on Amazon that were glass & always they were wrapped specially for protection against the rough treatments in transit . This time however ? it was rolling around loose DUH ! ! ! ! you do NOT insert 2 glass jars together in a big box & expect them to arrive in tact I mean how dumb ! ! ! it was so gross I couldnt salvage anything but the honey soaked tea boxes . Needless to say I wont be buying from this company again , I know who I can safely buy from..those sellers that take extra care in the shipping process . OUT $ 45.57 & one BIG FAT STICKY MESS ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! !	-1
Honey is a good wholesome food , problem is if its shipped in glass , its bound to get broke , which it was , so naturally i hate to waste any thing , i heated it up filtered the glass out of it , but i know it now was just like store bought , had to heat it , , , ,	-1
I was really excited to try these lollies . Do n't be . Most of the flavors taste nothing like their names . They are overpriced and extremely poorly packaged . If you think you are going to get some nice thing like the picture shows , GUESS AGAIN ! They arrive dumped in a plastic bag , which has been dumped in a box and dropped from a great height . For the kind of shipping they want it would be reasonable to expect a better presentation . These do last for a long time , which is n't really a plus since the flavors are nasty . If only they could get together with the people that make Jelly Belly and get some flavoring from them ... ..	-1
I saw this listed as purchased items to review . We never got this item though ! Not sure why it 's listed here and if we did indeed buy it , where it is !	-1
This Thanksgiving I went to my sisters , she made gravy with Zanthan Gum . Shortly after sampling the gravy I had a severe toxic reaction ; my face looked like a puffer fish , my heart was racing , vertigo , my tongue started to swell , I developed sepsis and my lungs partially collapsed.The packaging does not provide any guidance or black box warning ( as it should ! ) about the severe toxicity if used in quantities greater than .5 % of total volume of food or liquid . The manufacturer is negligent and even deceptive in marketing this manufactured product as if it were all natural.Xanthan gum is a largely indigestible polysaccharide that is produced by bacteria called Xanthomonas Camestris . Manufacturers place the bacteria in a growth medium that contains sugars and other nutrients , and the resulting product of bacterial fermentation is purified , dried , powdered , and sold as xanthan gum . ( Makes you wonder who first thought to put it in food , does n't it ? ) In other words , xanthan gum is an industrial processed product -- It is a polysaccharide produced by a biotechnological fermentation process -- a chemical . There is nothing natural about xanthan gum.Certainly never mix or serve to small children until the dangers are fully explained by the FDA 's ongoing investigations . Currently , there are on-going lawsuits as a result of Xanthan Gum being added to baby formula to thicken it , the babies intestines developed holes and collapsed , resulting in deaths.FDA has issued new cautions and studies as to this food additive 's safety . It certainly should not be sold in bulk giving the appearance that it is a flour of some type very misleading and possibly deadly . We 'll likely all hear more soon on this issue - just be cautious and know what and how much you are putting into your food and body - or your family's.One lesser-known use of xanthan gum is in the oil industry . As a thickener , it can be added to drilling fluid or drilling mud to improve its function . Drilling fluid serves several purposes , including cooling the drill bit , providing hydrostatic pressure , and helping to lift solids out of the borehole and keeping those solids in suspension when drilling stops.Gluten-free is not the same food just without Gluten , something else is added in it 's place . FInd out what and how safe it it is - better yet , just avoid any foods with Gluten if you do have Celiac 's disease . Shortcuts are rarely quite as simple as them may seem in my experience .	-1
I gave this one star because of the price and the fact that the pouch it come in is not resealable . I found and bought a 1 pound resealable bag on Amazon for 16 dollars vs just 4 ounces here for 11 . I wish I had of researched more before my purchase of this . Look before you leap .	-1
Was hoping for malty flavor but not so sweet as malted milk powder . Does n't taste like much of anything . Better than Horlik 's though . Been using it in smoothies and shakes .	-1
I was looking for an alternative to malted milk powder and the reviews state that this was even more malty than that . And its not . Its gross and mild .	-1
Without exaggeration , practically every mouthful of quinoa from this brand contained some grit.After using the entire bag of this brand , I bought cases of two other brands for comparison . I encountered no grit in a whole bag of one of those other brands , and only one little bit in one mouthful out of the other entire bag.I wo n't be buying this brand again .	-1
do n't buy these unless you really want to waste money ; taste horrible and trying to pop these in place of corn was a joke	-1
I tried so many different ways to pop this like I had seen on & # 34 ; Bazar foods & # 34 ; and I am not having a lot of luck . I have found a tablespoon of coconut oil in a microwave popper to be the best so far but I still have a poor popping ratio of only about 50 % . I love the sweet nutty flavor and crunchy texture but with such a large % of un-popped berries it is not really cost effective . I may give it a try again this summer as I purchased some seed to plant and will harvest my own .	-1
This is not the same as Ativa Dandelion tea . This one feels a little weird and honestly I do n't suggest it .	-1
this is a bag of coconut chips . Seems obvious . But unless you toast coocnut , its really just for a topping . This is a 1lb . bag of coconut topping . That being said , the quality of the chips were ok .	-1
Hydrolized proteins are MSG . If you have MSG sensitivities or related migraines , do n't buy this . This product claims to be free of MSG but it really just hides it under a different name .	-1
I love Amazon and I buy a lot here every month including many Subscribe And Save items but this is nuts . I also shop Walmart on line . I have two windows open right now . One for Amazon and one for Walmart . I 'm looking at an 8 oz jar of Chicken Better Than Bouillon for $ 3.44 delivered free of charge to my door from Walmart . Why would anyone pay almost 4 times as much on Amazon ? ? ? ? ? I guess it really pays A LOT to comparison shop . Based on reviews here , I 'm going to try this bouillon because it sounds really good . I have n't tried it yet so just letting you know the 2 stars is because of the price ... not the product quality.Update : Bought the base from Walmart on line and tried it . It 's good but not any better than others I 've tried . I think I like Wyler 's a little better .	-1
Typical of the US food industry , they have to pack the product full of salt . By the time you you get the saltiness diluted out all the flavor is diluted out .	-1
This tastes more like vegetable base than lobster base . It will work in a pinch and it does n't taste bad , but even fish sauce tastes better than this , if you were looking for something closer to a lobster flavor , plus it is far less expensive if you went to an Asian store . It is way too pricey than it should be and is why 2 stars . With its shell , I think the crustacean escaped the bouillon pot .	-1
Very upset ! I began to get a migraine after eating this product . I figured it said , `` USDA Organic '' . Well someone is not doing the right thing cause yeast extract is on the label and it admits it is not organic , but the front is miss leading ! They will not refund your money only sent you more product . This is their email to me in regards : Good afternoon Danielle.Thank you for your email . MSG was first produced from a seaweed broth in 1908 , and today disodium inosinate and disodium guanylate can both be produced from fish or dried seaweed & # 8211 ; although typical production of these ingredients now uses different raw materials . These flavor enhancers often work in conjunction with MSG to create a more complete flavor profile.It is important for you to know that our product does contain some MSG . Although we do not add any MSG to our Better that Bouillon line of products , they naturally contain MSG from the ingredients we use . MSG comes from the common amino acid glutamic acid , and glutamic acid is naturally present in our bodies , as well as in many foods and food additives . Since glutamic acid is naturally occurring in all protein , I am not aware of a chicken broth or base that does not contain at least some natural MSG . Of course , as you can see on our label , we do not add any additional MSG to our products.MSG has been a hot topic in the food industry for years . Because it is a high profile ingredient , MSG has been studied extensively by the FDA as well as independent researchers . In fact , the FDA commissioned a study on MSG in the 1995 to specifically answer the question whether MSG was safe as a food ingredient . The study came to the conclusion that MSG was safe . Results of this study can be found on the FDA website. [ ... ] The term `` natural flavor , '' `` natural flavoring , '' `` flavor '' or `` flavoring '' means the essential oil , oleoresin , essence or extractive , protein hydrolysate , distillate , or any product or roasting , heating or enzymolysis , which contains the flavoring constituents derived from a spice , fruit or fruit juice , vegetable or vegetable juice , edible yeast , herb , bark , bud , root , leaf or any other edible portion of a plant , meat , seafood , poultry , eggs , dairy products , or fermentation products thereof , whose primary function in food is flavoring rather than nutritional . Natural flavors include the natural essence or extractives obtained from plants listed in 21 CFR 182.10 , 182.20 , 182.40 , 182.50 and 184 , and the substances listed in 21 CFR 172.510 . The term natural flavor , natural flavoring , flavor or flavoring may also be used to designate spices , powered onion , powdered garlic , and powdered celery.We appreciate and value your business.Kedra AndersonCustomer Service Coordinator|Customer Service DepartmentSoutheastern Mills , IncPhone 706-378-6561800-334-4468 ext 6561Fax 706-378-6578Email kanderson @ semills.comHigh Performance Work Placecid : image003.png @ 01CEEB65.908BAC20	-1
It is quite salty & I think the ingredients should be more clearly listed for people who may have food sensitivities.yeast extract is often just a fancy name for MSG .	-1
While this maybe more versatile it is definitely not cheaper than buying boxed mac and cheese . The only benefit you get is that you get to pick what kind of pasta you use it for . When i got this I thought this would be great to have , now i can make wheat pasta with this mac and cheese . That was the only benefit ... .This powdered cheese is in my opinion too expensive and not natural or organic or anything of that nature . It is exactly the same cheese youd get in the Kraft box . It has yellow dyes in it and all the other chemicals and preservatives ... Do yourself a favor spend the extra buck and buy the Hodgson Mill Wheat Mac And Cheese Dinner . No dyes no artificial colors or flavors . Its whole wheat pasta and white cheddar cheese . Its not half bad either for a wheat pasta but none of the artificial stuff like this cheese .	-1
Contains whey , hydrogenated oil ( s ) , and a long list of non-cheese ingredients . This is not & # 34 ; cheese powder & # 34 ; it 's & # 34 ; cheese-flavored powder & # 34 ; but even that is arguable it seems .	-1
I read another review of this product that stated that this product 's first and main ingredient is whey . Whey is a by-product of milk ( remember that little Miss Muffet sat on her tuffet eating her curds and whey ) . Whey has a somewhat acidic taste that is rather crude . Cheddar cheese is way down the line in terms of percentage quantity in this stuff . I could n't think of what this stuff tasted like until I read the other review . It 's taste does not resemble that of cheddar cheese . I knew the product had an odd taste which I did not care for . I just did n't realize what that taste was until I came across the other review . There are no ingredients listed on the label . Now I understand why most liked the product . I assume because they are used to the taste of boxed macaroni and cheese products available in the grocery store with the orange/yellow powder in the packet inside the box . And most have come to think of that taste as cheese . Finer tastes however will reject this stuff , I think because it has little cheese . Cheddar cheese is made with the by products of milk as well . The big difference is the cultures that are added to produce the various types of cheese . Plus the aging . Whey requires no aging or cultures . Another of the characteristics of whey is that it has little orange/yellow color . This stuff has food colorings added to produce the appearance you see in the bag . I read another review where the writer complained about the lack of labeling . I agree because it is important to most to know what they are consuming . If you look at the ingredients of some of the other cheese powders you will see cheddar as the first ingredient unlike this stuff . I believe the reason that this product has no ingredient labeling is to hide that fact . By regulation ingredients are to be listed in the order of the percentage contained therein . In other words the first ingredient would be the highest percentage and therefore the last ingredient would be the lowest quantity contained . I 'm not sure what the percentage of cheddar cheese is in this stuff but its way down the line and not the first . I have tasted other cheese powders with ingredient lists . Some of best are those with cheese as the first listed ingredient not the 3rd or 4th . I really do n't like the taste of whey powder . It is crude and acidic . And that is to me what this stuff tastes like . I doubt whether I 'll buy any more of this . To each his own taste , though . I do n't purport to know what anyone else prefers .	-1
I gave this a few tries and ended up binning the rest . I am not a Mac and Cheese person , I did try to roll my own with some pasta also tried with instant mashed potatoes . Worth a try in either case .	-1
I bought this for popcorn after reading all the reviews . To keep it short here , it 's way too salty , so you have to use just a little , then you ca n't taste it because all you can taste is salt . Then there 's that super artificial bright orange color which is not at all close to the color of most cheddar cheeses . Too artificial looking . To sum it up , I do not recommend this for anything . Ca n't imagine putting on pasta for mac & cheese ! Way too salty ! Ick ! I will continue my search for cheese powder .	-1
We eat a lot of popcorn . I mean a lot . We buy it in 50 # bags - just the two of us ; the wife an I. I like flavors on my popcorn , and use garlic butter , Parmesan cheese , and other flavors . This cheese powder seemed like just the thing for a great flavoring on my popcorn . But , I was wrong . I tried it once . The bag is still clipped shut in the cupboard . The texture was gritty , and more stuck to the bowl than the popcorn . The color is more intense than the flavor . I did n't find it to be that cheese flavored popcorn I imagined.I told my wife to use it up in other dishes that could use a bit more cheese , but I do n't think she is too thrilled to try it again . Live and learn .	-1
I 'm so tired of false advertising on Amazon ! And fake reviews ! This stuff is mostly whey and a very small amount of cheddar and also contains two food dies ! ! ! It 's crap ! ! And your site advertising it as dried cheddar ! I 'm almost to the point of leaving Amazon for good !	-1
I use to consume Yeast for folic acid . Lewis Labs was the best till few years ago Russian chose to play with it since it became so valuable for the production of their alcoholic beverages . After the fermentation process is completed the yeast is harvested , thoroughly washed , pasteurized , and dried on roller drum dryers . The B vitamins are both naturally produced during fermentation , and added to the cream prior to the drying process . Riboflavin ( B2 ) and Cyanocobalamin ( B12 ) are created during fermentation . Additional Riboflavin ( B2 ) and Cyanocobalamin ( B12 ) are added after fermentation along with Thiamine ( B1 ) , Pyridoxine HCL ( B6 ) , Niacin and Folic Acid . Infact what this bag contains yeast and supplements , where I could care less for unregulated business for supplements.Frontier is a superb brand but no need to consume supplements . There are other brand that they sell without fortified supplements , just pure yeast for much less in price but trusting the source is the real issue since majority of these yeast are from outside US .	-1
These are definitely not flakes but more like granulated yeast . Make sure you read the product description before buying this product ! Carpe diem	-1
I sprinkled this on my cats food to help their appetite , entice them to eat more . It 's supposed to taste like cheese . Cats are supposed to love it . They did n't . I read where some people use it in place of cheese . I tasted it . Whoa ... ..no wonder the cats did n't want it . I donated it to a neighbor who used it . She loved it . Go figure . I guess we 're all born with different taste buds . Mine say no to nutritional yeast ! Your buds may care to differ !	-1
Yeast spread today is fortified with added supplements are banned in Denmark which disallows foods fortified with vitamins unlike US or UK . Yeast comes has the highest Folate and Riboflavin 1010mcg/5mg . Almonds are the highest in any seed or nut 50/1 and highest of all is baker 's active dry 2340/5 . Red Star is the best there is and used as the yeast by many supplement companies without specifying Red Star as their main ingredients . Yeast is different than nutritional yeast . Nutritional yeast is nothing but yeast with added supplement where one can purchase those added supplements separately with the preferred dosage where they can not with nutritional yeast since it is pre-mixed by the producer.Red star Other Ingredients : Inactive dry yeast , niacin , pyridoxine hydrochloride , riboflavin , thiamine hydrochloride , folic acid and vitamin B12 . Many vegans consume nutritional yeast not knowing that the B-12 is animal sourced vitamin and does not exists in beets , sugar or barley , it is only fortified with yeast . Why consume supplements since after all these are all added chemicals when I can get the raw ingredients .	-1
I never used this type of coconut oil before . I 'm not crazy about it . I would not recommend .	-1
When searching for premium popcorn for the Little Bambino popcorn popper we won , I bought a red popcorn just for fun . I 'm sorry I did.The kernels of Wabash Valley Farms Vintage Red popcorn were stale . They were dried out.You ca n't directly control the moisture locked in the dry kernels ; only the manufacturer can . If there is not enough , the kernels do n't pop big enough , they stop popping early , there are a lot of unpopped kernels , and the whole batch burns while you wait for the final slow pops . Popping produces steam , which prevents burning . No steam , no heat control . No heat control , burned popcorn.A few of the kernels were perfect . They tasted great . The red color was entertaining . But , just a few.Try another brand .	-1
I have been looking for red popcorn for some time and when I found this I was pretty excited and ordered it even though I had to order so much . I used to buy red popcorn when I lived in the midwest but have never seen it in the northwest . I have only popped it once and there were a lot of unpopped kernels . My cheap yellow popcorn from the grocery store is much better than this . I am very disappointed and do n't recommend buying it .	-1
I bought this and a few other Amish types from the same place . I think it may have been old and it did n't pop well in the microwave . I have much better luck with other types of popcorn . I would not buy again .	-1
YUCK ! ! I hate this popcorn ! ! The kernels are shriveled up and pitiful looking and it tastes like cardboard ! Do n't waste your money . I will never buy this again . However , 'Black Jewell Crimson ' , bought here at Amazon , is really good ! !	-1
The kernels are very small , much smaller than movie theater popcorn . There are also a lot more unpopped kernels and because the popcorn is so small , it tastes like I 'm eating larger hulls because the ratio of kernel to hull is closer . This is the worst of the three Amish flavors I tried , with Baby White as the clear winner . Skip this and go straight to Baby White .	-1
I guess I didnt understand GLAZE ... thats all it does is glaze the popcorn and the taste is **off** Just not the right taste to me	-1
I wanted to avoid using food coloring due to it containing the ingredient red 40 . So I used this powder for my red velvet cake . The color of the red velvet cake was light brown ; this powder does not work for red velvet cakes .	-1
I bought this to make cookies with red color , not wanting to use an unnatural red dye . The flavor was off-putting and the color was not what I was looking for .	-1
This takes nothing like chocolate at all . It has a strong cinnamin/nutmeg flavor that reminds me of pumpkin pie . I tried one and do n't think I 'll be drinking any more . As far as energy goes , I do think it works - but I ca n't enjoy the drink enough to continue .	-1
If you like chai , than you 'll probably like this ... I do n't . I do however like unsweetened Yerba Mate , and would n't mind if it came with a more complex flavors . In the past I 've mixed it with herbal mint or berry teas with good results and I was hoping this would be one bag solution to a chocolaty version . I knew it had other ingredients other than Mate and Cocoa , but were hoping they were milder background notes than they turned out to be . After I bought this I found ( The Republic of Tea , Double Dark Chocolate Mate , 36-Count ) and it 's exactly what I was looking for , earthy and aromatic but not sweet cocoa flavors . It 's a little pricey , but I feel it 's worth it . I 'm still happy with Guayaki 's plain mate , but I 'm going to have to pass on this one.PROS : + Nice quality Chai style MateCONS : - Tastes like Chai and Stevia ( neither of which I particularly care for )	-1
The chips have palm oil , containing a lot of saturated fat . This was not mentioned in the website . More information should have been provided .	-1
1 tablespoon of this product + 2 tablespoons of water = 1 egg.There 's eight powdered ounces.That 's 16 eggs. $ 12+ for 16 eggs ... a dozen eggs are $ 2.50 at my local Safeway.Put it another way : when you buy these , you are paying roughly 75 cents for each egg.If I were you , I 'd find another way to buy powdered eggs than via Amazon . The price is just outrageous .	-1
I have no doubt that it 's very good . But I bought the same package at GFS Foods for three bucks !	-1
I did not like it , I used it to sweeten Coffee and Tea , Lemonade , it did not work , it appeared to separate from the liquids , meaning you taste the stevia first and the liquids kicked in . It just did not blend like other sweeteners I tried .	-1
The packets I received show some form of stevia as the primary ingredient , but the box shows xylitol first . I would much prefer having more stevia , as xylitol upsets my stomach after a while . The taste of these is okay , but I feel cheated by the change in formulation , the conflicting labels , and the company 's lack of response when I called them last week for clarification .	-1
I have had other stevia products before and liked them . This stuff , however , is incredibly nasty . It tastes chemically and toxic . Twice I tried to get myself to drink it and both times I opted to throw out my coffee rather than tolerate the horrid taste . Awful product .	-1
I just received my package of Stevita Supreme stevia `` sweetener '' . It is the most repulsive tasting sweetener I have ever used . I 'm sure saccharine is better tasting than this stuff ! I did a side my side comparison of Stevita , aspartame and Splenda . The aspartame and Splenda are both decent tasting , and the Stevita is HORRIBLE ! Bitter , and tasting of some sort of chemical.Thank-god it was only [ ... ] bucks with free delivery because it 's probably going in the trash or to a soup kitchen - though the homeless certainly deserve better than this stuff .	-1
Does n't taste like ginger . Thought it would save me having to grate ginger - but is disappointingly flat in flavor . In fact , it has a kind off flavor . Would n't buy it again .	-1
I am picky about my spices , and I know when they are good . This product is not good . And it is NOT a substitute for fresh ginger . It has a weird , offputting chemical aroma and flavor , and packs none of the ginger punch it should . I used it once , then dumped the remainder down the drain in distaste . You 're much better off with the Ginger People brand . ( See this product : Ginger People Organic Minced Ginger -- 6.7 oz ) That one is so good , it can actually substitute for fresh ginger . It can even be used in chai ! Amazon used to sell it by the case ; hopefully they will get their act back together soon . In the meantime , I am buying it from Abe 's .	-1
My wife and I have been drinking Senseo pods for years . We have always used the medium roast . On our last shipment we noticed the coffee tastes stale and old . Very nasty . The old pods have the sense logo on the pods themselves and these new pods do not so I do n't know what that means but that seems to be the way to identify the bad tasting pods . These are so bad we ca n't even drink them . I 'm going to try one more order and if that tastes the same we may actually quit sense and move to Keurig . VERY disappointed in the new medium roast and I would not recommend as it tastes like coffee that is a week old .	-1
The Senseo pods are no longer a cost effective way of getting a quality cup of coffee . Looking through my order history , `` Back in the day '' a couple of years back this six pack of 18 pods used to hover around eighteen bucks ; now it is double that . So I got curious and I cut a pod and compared it against the content of a K Cup - the Senseo pod contains about half the coffee of a regular KCup . This means one has to use two Senseo pods to match the strength of a KCup for the same size brew . This translates to Senseo being more expensive than an average K Cup bought in quantity here at Amazon.Maybe I got used to the coffee , but the Senseo pods no longer produce the bold aroma and taste that got me hooked a few years back ; I defected to Keurig where I found a much richer variety and I do n't regret it for a second . On the contrary , I stopped having this nagging feeling of being ripped off by the constantly increasing price of these pods .	-1
Okay , people . I just do n't get it ! How can this stuff be getting five stars from so many people ? Do they know what coffee is SUPPOSED to taste like ? Yuck , yuck , and double YUCK ! This is akin to drinking dirty water ! I 've even doubled the pods to try to get a richer cup ... to no avail . What taste it has is horrible ... not that there is much taste at all ! I will struggle through this case and never buy it again ! All I wanted was a cup of decaf in the afternoon or evening ... a GOOD cup of decaf ! Is that too much to ask ? Apparently so ! I would n't recommend this stuff to my worst enemy ! Again , I say YUCK ! Also , my tummy 's reaction is such that I suspect there is gluten in the packaging of the pods ... perhaps in the glue ? I contacted Senseo to ask about it and they would n't give me an answer to my question unless I filled out a questionaire that would give them tons of information about ME ! Forget it ! That made me even more suspect ! I ca n't say for sure that there is gluten hiding somewhere . It is only a suspicion created by an all too familiar IBS reaction.Buy this stuff at your own risk , or , if you enjoy drinking weak coffee that looks and tastes like dirty water .	-1
Recently I ended up trying out the Senseo system , and I tried it with the Douwe Egberts medium roast pods . Normally I drink cold-brewed Toddy coffee , and even though I 'm sensitive to bitterness and acid levels in coffee , I can drink that with just dairy , no sugar . I immediately needed quite a bit of sugar for this coffee -- and then I had to start drinking half my usual amount of coffee . It was so bitter I almost could n't drink it . It was so acidic it made my stomach hurt . And it was so caffeinated I got the shakes that first time.The problem was , I had no idea if this was a result of the Senseo process ( the Toddy 's cold-brew method does result in a less bitter , less acidic , less caffeinated coffee than normal ) or the coffee brand . So , I ordered the EcoPad refillable pods ( 2 to a pack , very inexpensive ) and tried it with the same coffee I use with the Toddy . It tasted slightly weak , oddly ; however , it was enough for me to realize that the main problem was the Douwe Egberts coffee . If you really love the harsher Starbucks types of coffees , which I do n't , I think you 'll enjoy it . But if you have acid stomach problems or just do n't like bitter coffee , I do not recommend using DE medium roast coffee pods with your Senseo .	-1
I tried these with my JV/Melita Pod unit and they produced bland , unexceptional coffee . Considering they cost the equivalent of about $ 20 a pound , you might expect more , but it is just ordinary java .	-1
Went for economy in latest order and got the 6 pack as I could not recall what Dark Roast tasted like . Counted on all the positive reviews , but we all have different palates , do n't we ? I prefer Senseo 's Kenya or Sumatra as a more reliably flavorful brew with Sumatra probably my favorite . Just opened my first of six bags , so I have a ways to go before I get to the end of my `` bargain '' purchase of a brew that is weak and one-dimensional . I guess I will have to play with the amount of water and pods as other reviewers suggest to try to get something strong enough to satisfy . Just ca n't throw it all out !	-1
I find most of the Senseo coffee products to be tasteless , maybe watered down , but not full-bodied or delicious . I have tried several different Senseo varieties , but none are noteworthy and I would n't recommend any of them . I am going to try other pod brands .	-1
I used to have no problem with these , until one day on an impulse I decided to give Target 's Archer Farms brand coffee pods a try ( breakfast blend aka medium roast ) . They cost less , are bigger , individually wrapped and produce a much smoother coffee . Now I ca n't drink Douwe Egberts anymore and am hooked on Archer Farms .	-1
The packaging on these cookies WAS HORRIBLE . they sent in a box that was to big so the cookies were flying all over in the box . They did n't even bother taking out of the original box even though it was half empty . Look 's like a 2 year old packed it . WHAT A JOKE ! ! ! !	-1
I Ordered this and waited for two weeks -- NEVER recieved it . I Emailed and asked where it was , and said if Not shipping soon , cancel it . They Cancelled it . Obviously Not in stock and this COMPANY doesnt care about sales . No attempt to send it to me . I will Find it elsewhere I guess . This was for the cannister .	-1
This stuff is just a powdery waste of money . I wo n't buy it again , ever . You 'd do better with packets of swiss miss ...	-1
When you make this kimchi according to the instructions , you essentially are letting the cabbage soak overnight in brine , then draining it and mixing in a packet of ground spices before sticking it immediately into the refrigerator to let the flavors marry . This is NOT the same thing as fermenting a batch of kimchi for days at room temperature so that those wonderful fermentation bubbles build up and render the special `` tang on the tongue '' that I realized ( after making this ) is critical to good kimchi.I also found the flavor strange , too sweet and also a little `` off '' in a way I can not describe . I did n't weigh my cabbage , but I selected a standard-sized Napa head so it had to be in the ballpark of four pounds . But the flavor of the packet overwhelmed the cabbage completely . I wound up rinsing off as much as I could , then stuffing the cabbage back into a mason jar and putting it under airlock on the counter to see if I can salvage the batch . The verdict is still out.I 'm not a kimchi purist or connoisseur , but I know enough to know this is n't what I like . I 'm going back to Sandor Katz ' technique fromWild Fermentation : The Flavor , Nutrition , and Craft of Live-Culture Foodsand see if I ca n't get closer to something I ca n't stop eating . Maybe I can work some of this product into the recipe somewhere along the way and it 'll be magic , and I do hope this is the case because I 've got 11 packets left .	-1
Great if you like fluorescent red meat you can see in the dark . The Korean version NOH sells is great but this is just bright red food coloring that looks like something a 3 year old made . It is terrible and it makes hideous looking meat that looks like something from a horror movie .	-1
this is an acquired taste . My family has not acquired it . My son suggested I call it the best laxative on the market . Is it really supposed to be brown ?	-1
Wow , was I looking forward to this after the great reviews . I got it today & made a cup right away . What a huge disappointment . The cinnamon oil is overpowering in a very unpleasant way . I can not taste or smell any other spice . The green tea does come through a bit.I forced myself to finish the cup . I doctored it with extra fresh cardemom and fresh star anise . It was not worth the effort , it was as if I 'd never put them in the cup.If you like true chai flavored tea and do not want the cinnamon to overpower your taste buds , this is NOT for you . Stay away from this stuff.Even from the perspective of the cinnamon flavor , this tea is not pleasant . I understand cinnamon is good for lowering blood sugar levels , so if you want to use this as a medicinal tea , I guess this would be acceptable.I ca n't send this back , so I 'll be using it in a pot of boiling water for a cinnamon potpourri . I would n't even mix it with my other chai teas as there is just too much cinnamon oil.Stash would have been better off just using the real spices and skipping the oils . Now I am concerned about the green tea chai from Stash . I have some on order and they noted that they included clove oil . I 'm hoping it wo n't taste like a cup of clove water.Very , very disappointed .	-1
So I order over a hundred bags of Organic Decaf Premium Green Tea , being unable to find it locally to try , and it has hardly any flavor : - ( ( ( Bummer .	-1
I ordered 6 on scribe and save but received only 1 . The box was squashed since it was packed with numerous heavy items in a really big box.I wo n't know until I receive my credit card how I was charged , but it should be free as far as I 'm concerned since I did not get what I ordered and the website refused to let me schedule a return . At least I should be charged 1/6th of what the subscribe and save price was.The tea inside the package is undamaged .	-1
This decaf really disappointed me , esp . given the other glowing reviews . It does not appear green , nor does it taste `` green '' ( ie : does n't have that fresh `` grassy '' flavor many describe as found in an authentic Japanese green tea ) . Actually , this could be a good paring with seafood , because I sometimes detect a slight fishiness in the taste . Yuk . Stash Decaf Green , the non-organic , non-premium tea , is actually a little better than this one . What people like is a matter of personal taste , but I wo n't ever buy this tea again .	-1
I was very excited to get these Tapioca Pearls to make bubble tea . They arrived a powdery blob of mess in the bag . It looked like someone dropped the bag and kicked it around until it was turned into mostly dust .	-1
I just received this assortment of candy for the second time and I am quite disappointed . The only reason that I ordered the same one again was that my friend loves rock candy . The rock candy is no longer included , although it is still advertised as being in there.In fact , a lot of the candy that was in there the last time is gone . The pieces that were full sized before are no longer full size and the candy tastes as if it was also made in the sixties and has been sitting around since then , waiting for some sucker to order it . Do yourself a favor and save your money , it is not worth the price they charge at all .	-1
We normally get Stash tea in this household , but I thought for the holidays , we would try some authentic English breakfast tea . Oh my . It was just awful . Its back to Stash for us .	-1
Stale as all get out ! Do not buy ! Learn from my bad ! Do not waste your money ! Gag ! Ack ! Barf !	-1
Yesterday I wrote to this Seller stzting that I got 4 of these barrels of cheese balls , and each one had an expiration date of 1/07 -- - seems like they went through their inventory and sent out everything that was old -- - have not heard back from them , so that 's why I am writing this . We give a lot of these out to the kids in the neighborhood as presents . Today we got another 4 from a Seller -- - these 4 barrels had an expiration date of 2/25/12 ! ! ! The need to realize that taking old inventory just to get rid of it during the holiday rush does n't really work -- - it 's going to be a long time before I order anything from them again ...	-1
I wrote a review for Sprout House brocolli seeds in 2009 . That review is below . I have never ordered seeds from Todd 's . Seed quality varies greatly for many reasons including the storage and shipping conditions and the age of the seed . I do n't know whose fault it is that my review of Sprout House Seeds which are excellent ended up under Todd 's seeds . Todd has said that he has requested that this issue be corrected but that Amazon has refused.I am leaving this review here to alert you to the fact that all reviews posted under Todd 's seeds relating to a product reviewed before early 2010 can not be referring to Todd 's company . Todd did not start selling organic broccoli seeds on Amazon until early 2010 . In addition , any reviews referencing a product bought from Sprout House would not be applicable to Todd 's Seeds.INITIAL REVIEW : I am very happy with these seeds . High yield , in my opinion relatively mild flavor for broccoli sprouts and Rita the Sprout Lady at Sprout House provides cheerful , great , fast service . If you eat broccoli sprouts or want to , sprouting your own is the way to go . Much less expensive than buying the sprouts at the grocery store and the quality of your own sprouts will be superior - much fresher and crisper.UPDATE : April 27,2011 . I had some leftover broccoli seeds that I kept in the refrigerator for two years from Sprout House . They are still sprouting well and are delicious . They just take a little longer to get going than when they were first purchased.FOLLOW UP REVIEW WHEN MY SPROUT HOUSE REVIEW STARTED APPEARING UNDER TODD 'S SEEDS : UPDATE : August 11 , 2011 . The seeds I bought were from Sprout House . I continue to buy from Sprout House . Amazon should not have placed my review under seeds from an entirely different vendor . Not all seeds are equal .	-1
This stuff is horrible ! ! ! It smells like and tastes like diesel ! Obviously not real vanilla powder . Do n't waste your money or time ordering this ! I had to throw it out because it smelled so bad . The diesel flavor transfers into the food you use it on . Totally disgusting ! I 'd like to give it a & # 34 ; 0 & # 34 ; stars or negative star rating .	-1
Vanilla taste is just not in the product , leaves a scum in the cup , not what I expected at all , back to Lorann 's Vanilla liquid.Maybe I can palm the other two bottles to an unsuspecting gullible guy like me .	-1
all vanilla powders are not the same , thought i could get away with it , but never will get this again , disappointing taste and a bit grainy too	-1
I did n't care for the smell at all , my personal preference . It did n't smell like roses ... more like a strange fake flower scent . The lotion was good ... . but I could n't use it .	-1
By far this is the weirdest/stinkiest organic product I have ever encountered . In a nutshell this lotion smells like baby puke , I mean baby food thrown up all over , so gross . It did n't hit me in the store but when I got back to work and slathered it all over I was n't so sure that the smile on my face wanted to remain there . My friend bought it too , I smelled her on her skin and in the tube and same thing , yuck.The moisturizing properties are meek , at their best . This is not really for mature skin , I had to reapply repeatedly and it felt my hands feeling clammy and stinking of baby food and I 'm only twenty six . I adore this line for all their other products , the shampoos are amazing and the scrub works well but this one item is not the best to sample . I would suggest testing it in the store to see if one can handle it before shelling out some bucks on it . I rarely encounter beauty products that are this bad , and this one cuts the cheese , err I mean takes the cake in this case.- Kasia S .	-1
THIS STUFF IS A RIP OFF ! It does'nt work , I have baked bread for many years as a G.F. person and tried this junk in my prep . to bake and this # $ @ ^ clumps into one little area and there it is ! ! !	-1
I had to throw this out because it really did n't taste good . It 's hard to describe the taste , but it did n't taste like anything that I 've had in Japanese restaurants .	-1
in an effort to watch my caloric intake and stay more or less carb free i 've been searching for products to add to my collection of foods that will help me achieve my weight loss/ health goals ... I 've tried a lot of WF products and i find them all pretty much the same ... .super fake tasting . That said , i suppose they add a good fake flavor to salads and the like , but i 'd rather just find something with maybe a few calories/fat etc and eat that than this completely chemical processed stuff ... .Good luck to folks who love it ... .but this and all WF are just not for me .	-1
i thought this would be the answer to some of my low carb eating prayers ... .but ... .sadly ... its just too much chemical flavour and not enough yumminess for me ... mixed with real hot sauce it is doablish ( thats a word ) good luck to tastebuds that love it tho ( i know there is more than one of you out there )	-1
I normally love Walden Farms foods , but this sauce is not at all what I expected . It has a very bitter , acidic taste to it . If you 're looking for a substitute for sweet barbeque sauce , this is not it .	-1
It 's not just THIS Walden Farms product , but every one I 've tried . Syrups , marshmallow dip , Ketchup , Cocktail sauce ... .. ! ! You 'd think after wasting so much money on them ( not to mention the taste that leaves your mouth feeling like a chemical sewer ! ) I 'd learn but kept hoping ONE item would be salvageable . No . They are so bad I almost considered gargling with bleach to erase the taste . There are no words for what these Walden products taste like : not any that can be printed on Amazon , at any rate . ( shudder )	-1
Give Walden Farms credit for making a no-carb sauce . It 's just a shame it does n't taste better . Still , I do buy it on occasion and mix it with other tastier sauces to lower the over all carb content . However , the smoke taste is so overwhelming that more than a proportion of 1:4 leaves only the taste of this product in your mouth . This product can not begin to compare with the taste of the now-defunct Kraft 's low-carb barbecue sauce . Mostly , I make my own low-carb sauce from scratch and then just add a bit of this to get the smoke taste , but too much and even the best batch of homemade sauce is ruined . However , if you are on an extreme low-carb diet ( such as Dr. Bernstein 's ) this may be the only product that fits .	-1
This oil has a rancid , off-putting odor that smells NOTHING like coconut , more like yeast . It also has a TERRIBLE taste . DO NOT BUY ! ! ! I consume a jar of coconut oil a week because I take it as a supplement and cook with it . Jarrow , Spectrum , Nutiva , Vitacost and Swanson are MUCH better . Their coconut oils smell really good with a fresh , coconut scent and taste great too.I was surprised because I use other NOW products and am happy with them . The quality , judging by my experience & others ' , is that this may just be a faulty jar but the quality is n't consistent . I do n't see bad reviews from the other oils I use & I have never had a bad batch from the others I have mentioned .	-1
If you are interested in using this as a dietary supplement you should buy in bulk . You would have to take more than half the bottle at one time just to receive the daily dietary benefits . This is 10 times more expensive than buying in bulk and either taking with a spoon or adding it to your food . I am fond of NOW 's products but this is just a response to a uneducated consumer demand . SO GET EDUCATED ! It is your health ! Find a much better online bulk price and buy it by the gallon or better and you will be feeling and looking better !	-1
This product does NOT decrease nor repell fleas . Also , as per my vet - garlic is not recommended for dogs . I have discontinued the product and trashed the rest .	-1
ive been using this product for the past month or so . i have 2 dogs and a cat . it does nothing for flea control . infact , in seems like they have more fleas now than before . i think the fleas love the garlic ! the dogs love the taste of the chewable tabs . the dogs breath smells like garlic . i 'll continue to use the product cause the dogs love the `` treat '' so much . but wont buy it again for flea control .	-1
One of my dogs certainly like this little tab . It has not , however , solve our flea problems.I have two terriers . One which has skin problems and I had hoped Brewers Yeast would help him out . Oddly , his tablet has to be mixed into his wet food.Flea control still has to be used . The bottle is still almost full . So I will continue to use it for their coats . But I would not recommend as flea control	-1
I 've only been giving my poodle mix ( 15 lbs . ) these capsules for like two weeks now but I 'm already considering stopping them . They have n't really done much to help the fleas and I think they might be harming him because he 's been drinking too much water . On account of all the water he drinks he has to go pee A LOT and wakes me up in the middle of the night . I 'm worried that the pills might be affecting his kidneys so I think I 'm going to stop giving them to him . That 's too bad because I was really excited to give these to my pet since the reviews are really good . Although I did see some possitve changes in him it has n't been enough to outdo the possible negative consequences . I also read that brewers yeast can cause bloating so I 'm not sure this is such a good idea after all . Has anybody else experienced this ?	-1
I had visions of Girl Scout cookies and my favorites , the mint wafers , to be exact . Well , these are not it . These cookies are simply sandwich cookies in the traditon of Oreo , but with a mint filling . If they had more stuffing they might have been good ; as it was , they were too dry . And lacking a chocolate icing like Girl Scout wafers , they leave a gritty Oreo lingering feeling after you eat them .	-1
Having purchased these cookies previously at the grocery store , I had high hopes , but the packages I received and have since shared with anyone who will eat them , were not fresh at all . They were w/in the time frame on the package and did not appear to be damaged but were just not up to snuff . Think I will stick to purchasing them locally , one bag at a time .	-1
I 've previously tried , and liked , Newman-O 's chocolate sandwich cookies but found these bland , boring and completely free of ginger taste . The texture was try and just overall the only flavor was `` sweet '' ... generic sugar taste and nothing more . Just not a fan .	-1
I love Amaranth flour in baked goods as it adds a rustic earthy flavor , however making this on the stovetop grain as if it were quinoa or millet it has an awful flavor and texture . Texture is kind like slimy quinoa , but with an very bitter flavor profile . I hope I can grind this in my coffee maker and turn it into flour as it is awful just cooked .	-1
I thought I 'd try this grain after reading about it 's health benefits . I am a big fan of quinoa and millet , and amaranth seemed similar enough . I ordered through subscribe and save and got a good price . The product is good quality and came packaged appropriately . The problem I had with it is the SMELL . This grain cooks up like cream of wheat or malto meal , however , the smell is horrible ... ..kinda musky , kinda earthy , downright off-putting . I tried masking this with cinnamon and vanilla . I tried mixing the grain with steel cut oats . No matter what , the pungent and specific smell of amaranth overpowers the taste and any enjoyment of the product . I could only get through half and bag and the whole lot went into the garbage . That being said , if you love the smell/texture/taste of amaranth , arrowhead mills is a good company to buy it from .	-1
UPDATE INFO AS OF 1/29/2014List Price : $ 20.94Price : $ 4.91 ( $ 0.02 / oz ) You Save : $ 16.03 ( 77 % ) $ 0.02 an oz for 16oz in a pound will be only $ 0.32 a bag not $ 4.91 as claimed by the seller . Flax seeds sells never sells for $ 20.94 a bag as claimed by the seller . It seems that the seller keeps changing the sale numbers in order to sell a product . Arrowhead is an excellent brand with many great organic products where others fail to produce in organic form but this approach is just misleading and not necessary at all . *****************************************************************************************************************************ORIGINAL REVIEW 10/11/2013Seller claims ; List Price : $ 40.61Price : $ 8.24 ( $ 0.04/oz ) & FREE Shipping on orders over $ 25You Save : $ 32.37 ( 80 % ) That is misleading . No flax sells for $ 40 a pound . At $ 8.24 a pound it is 824/16=51.5 infact something like more than $ 0.51 cents an oz not $ 0.04 an oz . Arrowhead is a good brand but the seller is misrepresenting the facts . *****************************************************************************************************************************MISLEADING LABELING : sprinkle a tablespoon of ground seeds ... 14oz not 16 oz since it is golden not brown.It is shame that Arrowhead with so many fine organic products will misguide consumers just to sell a product . In the beginning there was only one color flax which was brown but now there is golden as well . Usually in organic form except in supplement form , the farmer co-up flax or any type of seeds are always more expensive due to their practices which is not sold on Amazon at all . Brown and golden have the same nutritional value so I never consume one , I mix brown and golden regardless . In some cases Golden is more expensive than brown . If not specified on the labeling the type of flax , then it means brown flax not golden flax.OILS : I started consuming flax oil years ago per my physician 's advise not knowing that majority forms of flaxseeds are rancid and absolutely worthless due to oil in seeds . As whole , human body can not digest any seed that size with that consistency regardless if it is flax , sesame , amaranth , chia , millet , etc . unless cooked or in ground form since human body can not digest in its natural form . As SUPPLEMENT , TABLET FORM , OIL , POWDER , GROUND IN BAGS are all worthless and hardly offer any nutrients unless ; seeds are fresh , not old which means rancid , not in oil form , not in supplement form , not hulled , ground and consumed within few days , kept in dark cold temperatures , away from light-sun-moisture since the oil in seeds and nuts go rancid regardless . Rancid is a process of Mother Nature and has nothing to do with organic , conventional , GMO or the type of seed . Advising consumers to purchase different brands of flax in oil form or powder or tablet form are all marketing tools as well . It is not important even if the oil or the tablet or the powder in bags are even frozen at the time of production till you consume since any seed , and I mean any type of seed regardless of the type or brand will go rancid once ground and cracked open since the shell , the protection is removed and air will get to the oil of the seed much quicker than when the seed is in a complete un-hulled form . The best example of rancidity is brown rice . Place some in freezer and you will notice in few months it will not even cook since the oils have gone rancid even if you keep the rice in a sealed container , wrapped in the most elaborate sealing containers in the world regardless . Chia is the only seed that claims it does not need to be ground but that is a marketing tool just like the price of chia is since it comes from outside US and individuals without any knowledge about nutrition always associate those as superior for exotic reasons and pay a hefty price for a food item with less nutrients . I ground in my coffee grinder sesame , flax , chia , amaranth , hemp then add cocoa , isolate protein , soy milk and consume it before my workouts on daily basis for its vitamins , minerals , protein and many nutrients , without much spike in my glucose . Un-hulled seeds are full of nutrients . I never consume hulled seeds which are empty calories , absolutely worthless since the nutrients have been removed . After many years of consuming seeds , I chose to ground all seeds myself and seal immediately , kept in freezer and consumed within few days which I am very happy with the results since after all looking fit and well is just result of training hard and living a healthy lifestyle which surrounds any professional athlete or a happy individual involved in many sport activities regardless.OMEGA 3 : You will never see ALA on any fish you purchase . Infact you will never see ALA on any fish oil supplement either , you will only see EPA and DHA . ALA is not the same as EPA or DHA and it is the same for any brand of flax seed regardless if such flax seed oil is in solid oil form in a bottle or a capsule form . Greens , nuts , seeds , fruits and vegetables do not offer any omega-3 since omega-3 EPA/DHA is an animal source . Flaxseeds offer more ALA than chia , 22.8gr vs. 17.8gr . There are two major types of omega-3 fatty acids in our diets : One type is alpha-linolenic acid ( ALA ) , which is found in plants the other type , eicosapentaenoic acid ( EPA ) and docosahexaenoic acid ( DHA ) , is found in fatty fish . The body partially converts ALA to EPA and DHA . There is no proof what percent of ALA gets converted by human body to EPA or DHA . You can consume all ALAs that you want and depending to your genes it may never turn any into omega-3 . Blood test is the only way to see the affects . I get omega 3 from sardines although flaxseeds are important part of my diet since flax offers so many different nutrients.FIBER : Fiber is essential for body since fiber absorbs the unwanted liquid in the gut and body has to defecate that blown up fiber which in return lowers cholesterol , blood pressure , etc . and brings comfort and efficiency to human body unlike fat which stays in human body unless needed for energy . Flax is high in fiber.MINERALS : Flax is the king of nutrients when it comes to minerals so important to me as a whole delicious seed ; highest ALA , highest magnesium , highest potassium , calcium with the healthiest fat.Accordingly for 100gr servings size of ; SESAME__FLAX__CHIA__AMARANTH__QUINOA__HEMP__PISTACHIO__ALMOND__CASHEWCALORIES565__534__490__371__368__567__557__575__553SAT FAT34__18__16__7__4__17__27__19__39CALCIUM99__26__63__16__5__0__11__26__4MAGNESIUM89__98__0__62__49__167__30__67__73POTASSIUM14__23__5__15__16__167__29__20__19ZINC48__29__23__19__21__83__15__21__39FIBER47__109__151__8__11__4 __41__49__13PHYTOSTEROLS714__0__0__0__0__N/A__214__0__0FRESHNESS : Fresh means nutritious and delicious . I consume lots of seeds , beans , grains , vegetables , etc . and freshness is a priority regardless of the brand so I always purchase my food ingredients in small quantities from reputable sellers with high turnover . When fresh , food is nutritious and that goes for any food in any form , from frozen to canned . Fresh food is nutritious as well as delicious since nutrients give food its delicious taste . When old or rancid , nutrients are gone and any food item becomes an empty calories with no taste and absolutely worthless regardless of the brand or price , organic or conventional.FAT : The most important hormone , and the one that 's crucial for weight loss , is insulin . Insulin is the hormone that controls fat storage . A high-carb diet increases the amount of glucose in the bloodstream , which in turn means you produce more insulin . The more insulin the body produces , the more fat gets stored . A low-carb diet means less insulin , making it easier to lose weight because less fat is then stored . For intake of a massive 5,000 calories every day for three weeks with calories from a low-fat , high-carb diet ; and for another three weeks with calories from more fat no carbs with exactly the same amount of calories , with moderate exercise regimen each time ; low-fat diet stacked on 16 & # 8201 ; lb with 3.7 '' ( 9.5 & # 8201 ; cm ) around the middle where the high fat diet offered a loss of 2.5 lb and loss of 1 '' ( 2.5 & # 8201 ; cm ) from waistline . If calorie is calorie , then in my case and my experience shows that I would prefer to get my calories from a healthy fat from sesame seed and almond than the calories from the carbs in chia . Almonds have the highest fat calories from all the seeds and nuts , a priority to me in type of calories since I am kind of vegan who consumes fish but hardly any meat , chicken , pork or dairy.Accordingly for 28gr/1oz servings size of ; Amaranth__quinoa__flax__peanut__almonds__chia__sesame__sunflower__cashew__pistachioTOTAL CALORIES28.6__33.6__ 150__166__161__137__160__162__155__156CALORIES FROM CARBS21.2__23.6__33__28.9__24.6__50__26.8__31.2__34.4__31.8CALORIES FROM FAT3.7__4.8__98.8__121__116__72.1__116__112__103__104CALORIES FROM PROTEIN3.7__4.9__17.8__16.8__20.6__15.2__17.2__19.1__17.7__20For almost the same total calories sesame offers half of chia 's `` CARB CALORIES '' gain but 50 % more `` FAT CALORIES '' with high amount of nutrients for weight loss . Sesame , flax and hemp are my superfood but almonds are the superfood when it comes to vitamin E. Americans consume enough peanut butter each year to coat the floor of the Grand Canyon , priced for 1/3 but hardly with any nutrients except B-complex . No wonder Burma is the highest producer of sesame in the world . But none of those kings offer ALA and not only flax 's high ALA is needed but it balances the omega-6 which is so worthless and abandoned in all foods that not healthy at all . Flax only in powder form , ground freshly .	-1
Admittedly I like pure vanilla flavor and I was expecting this to have quite a bit of vanilla - after all it 's not called rooibos vanilla - the vanilla came first in the name therefore I want vanilla to be the high note . Well it is n't it 's more of an afterthought and quite honestly it went in the trash ! I usually like Celestial Seasonings but this one definitely did n't do it for me .	-1
The packaging was bad to begin with , it was in a yellow envelope and the box was crushed . Then the tea itself ... Well it was tolerable , but not very good . It just had this strong chemical-vanilla flavor , so I wo n't be ordering again .	-1
I have a love for gingersnaps and candied ginger . On the other hand , this candy tastes absolutely repulsive . Earlier reviews talk about rice paper and other such things , but this candy only had a weird white powdering on it . I ended up spitting it out after a few seconds . Will not buy ever again !	-1
If you want a real ginger chew buy Gin Gins . These have & # 34 ; hint o ginger & # 34 ; at best . I think they waved the ginger over the box before shipping to call them ginger chews . I guess I got spoiled on Gin Gins . They do n't taste nasty or anything just like sugar taffy . Glad I got the small package to try them . I had my husband take them to work to try and get rid of them on the unsuspecting people there .	-1
Need much more coffee to gate a full bodied flavor . Great if you 're not a real coffee drinker . Would n't recommend .	-1
When I made it , it looked like coffee -- very dark . It tasted like it was burnt , almost like they over roasted the barley . I did not like this tea at all .	-1
I bought this coffee expecting a dark roast to use in my espresso machine . I know it 's an italian roast but it 's much more medium to light than other italian roasts I 've had . The color of the beans is similar to the top of the bag ( a medium brown ) , not oily at all ( in fact , they look completely dry ) . Whether this is normal or not for this roast , I do n't know.All the other italian , and dark/full-bodied roasts I 've had have been much darker , bordering on blackish , and have at least some oil on the bean surface.This coffee brews extremely light as an espresso . I 'd say it 's nutty and a bit sweet as well . Lacks depth & complexity . It is smooth , but so is water . There are no of those darker-roast flavors ( smoky , chocolate , toast , etc . ) or heartiness.If you 're a fan of espresso , french roast , sumatra , and other bold/dark-roasts , this coffee is not for you . I wish I could return this .	-1
I have been consistently disappointed in the various Lavazza blends that I have tried . My last hotel/travel interface with poor quality ground Lavazza pods has resulted in a new addition to my cosmetic bag -- a little Ziplock full of Senseo brand pods , which are decent if not superlative , fairly common in stores , and will accomodate many coffee coffee makers . I thought the last Lavazza incident was just a bad batch , but it 's statistically unlikely that it should keep happening every time . If you have had better luck with specific blends , bless you , but I think it 's not my crappy Karma , but their crummy coffee . Just my two cents ; your mileage may vary . I use coffee to pry open the eyelids and I need to hit the ground running , so the first cup has to be acceptable . Life is to short to drink dishwatery coffee.Senseo Douwe Egberts Coffee Pods , Variety Pack , 16-Count Packages ( Pack of 4 )	-1
I read a review and was excited to try this salt . I did n't think it was anything special and would highly recommend Morton 's Kosher Salt which is far superior and more flavorable in my opinion . It is available at any grocery store and much cheaper too !	-1
As the title states - I 'm looking for JASMINE tea . this is more like green tea , no hint of jasmine . Not ordering this again	-1
These are very small and a light tannish color . They are not at all like the ones I used to grow in my back yard . I tasted a spoonful of these seeds and had to spit them back out . They were the epitome of staleness . I expected tasty seeds based on the super high price but these are a loser . I guess I will have to go back to growing my own.I put this bag of seeds into my bird feeders and during this unusually cold freeze and lots of snow there are more birds hanging around the feeders then I have seen in years . They are not as picky as I am and they gobbled up the seeds in a NY minute . I give the seeds an extra star because the birds ate them all up . These seeds are clearly not worth the price and especially not for bird food . I buy 35 pound bags of black sunflower seed at BJ 's for around 30 bucks and the birds love them . Do n't buy these stale Now Foods seeds .	-1
UGH this stuff tastes gross . It looks good but tastes more like chemicals than anything . I have been lo carb for years but I can not eat this stuff ! ! !	-1
I thought I would try to cut a few points out of my day by using this chocolate dip to help my cravings ... It tasted okay . It was okay with fruit , but the fruit was way sweeter than the chocolate . It almost tasted like a very bitter chocolate . I think if I did n't eat any chocolate for a couple months then ate this I would like it , but that 's not the case . It will probably sit in my fridge until it expires .	-1
I love Nips and thought these would be a stronger coffee flavor version . They are not . They are flat rectangular , which is not a good fit for the human mouth , rock hard , and nasty , bitter tasting . I could n't get through my first one and had to spit it out , it was that bad .	-1
I gave these several gos at re-hydrating . I agree with another reviewer that they are rubbery and tasteless . Finally binned the whole lot .	-1
Expensive , not real truffle taste , undertone of old olive oil . I wo n't buy this again . It 's much better to use fresh olive oil and infuse with truffle in a blender . No real place for this in my kitchen .	-1
Not having seen this before , I went for it , an if you do n't like the taste of Garlic or smell of it , then I would not reconmend this to you ... ..I do n't like the taste of it or the smell of it . The company did refund me my purchase price with out sending the product back to them . Never tasted what Traffule Oil was , I know its not for me .	-1
The gum tastes OK . But $ 1 for a single piece of gum is not reasonable .	-1
For quite some time , I have been using different types of hot sauce on different types of food . Before I started doing this , I only ever remember using hot sauce on barbeque sandwiches . Even though I have tried numerous types of hot sauce during this period , Sriracha Hot Chili Sauce has set itself apart from the others as being a hot sauce that I do not consider to be a favorite . Even though it is not terrible -- I used two bottles of it -- it is not something that I would use on a regular basis . As for the sauce 's flavor , it is distinctive yet peculiar . It has a nice heat to it , also -- not too mild and not too hot . I have used it on multiple kinds of food . I do not consider Sriracha Hot Chili Sauce to be a preference , but I do admit that it stands out from the other hot sauces that I have used . Actually , I rate it 2.5 stars .	-1
I was very excited to try these but it is either this is not a very quality product or I just do n't get it -- -the mushroom had no taste . I made myself one serving of a cream-based sauce for farina spaghetti and shredded this mushroom in it -- -- it offered zero taste .	-1
I was very excited about this purchase until I tried this truffle.These were horrible . Maybe I got the worst bottle they have ever sold and I just happened to get them . But , these are bad . If you want to eat the root of a dirty old root of a tree , you will enjoy these . If you doubt my credibility of my review , please feel free to read my other reviews . Please do n't waste your money . My wife tried these and could n't even believe these could be called truffles .	-1
I desperately wanted a good organic vanilla flavor . This product provides a wonderful aroma . I opened the bottle ( love the glass bottle - so tired of plastic ) and thought & # 34 ; this will be great. & # 34 ; The first pound cake I made using it did n't seem to have the strong vanilla flavor I like for my cakes . And then I tried it in coffee . No significant flavor whatsoever . I do n't recommend it and I wo n't buy it again . : (	-1
Up Front : I did not buy this product on Amazon but still wanted to let people know . I purchased a 17 oz . bottle of Kikkoman Aji-Mirin last night at a supermarket for $ 4.99 . I tasted it when I got home . Was n't too impressed . I think I 'd prefer using my rice wine vinegar and adding a little sugar to it .	-1
I thought I was ordering rice wine as listed in the item headline but it is a & # 34 ; seasoning & # 34 ; which consists mostly of corn syrup ( an item i NEVER buy ) . Rice and alcohol are in the ingredient list , but this is not real Mirin ( rice wine ) . Did n't notice til I had cooked with it , then it did n't taste right so I read the label and ingredients . I was highly disappointed and threw it in the trash .	-1
Homemade , with seaweed and smoked tuna flakes , is much better , and not much more work . It 's OK , but not great .	-1
I wanted to make some yummy miso soup , so I bought this Dashi . I make homemade food for the health of my family and guests . I was really disappointed to purchase something loaded with MSG . Maybe I can give it away to someone who does n't care about carcinogenics .	-1
Its hot stuff like horseradish is . Throw in some green coloring and VIOLA you have & # 34 ; wasabi & # 34 ; . It is obvious this is NOT Wasabi root , the original Japanese sushi and sashimi spice . Says so right on the pack . Worse is the great price at $ 1.99 until you notice the shipping at $ 5.25 making the total ACTUAL price $ 7.24 . Pick it up at your local grocery store in the Asian section for $ 1.79 . Wish Amazon would make vendors clarify BOTH cost UP FRONT instead of the old bait and switch . No sale .	-1
This product contains GMO 's Known to cause Cancer and Organ Failure , Im sorry but I will not be feeding my family your cereal anymore until you use safer ingredients . Shame on you	-1
Kellogg 's Frosted Flakes contain ingredients which are patented by chemical companies that genetically engineered them in a lab and turned them into EPA registered pesticides . That 's right , folks ! GMO Bt corn is an EPA registered pesticide . Foreign genes have been forced into the DNA which cause every cell of the plant to make its own pesticide . When corn worms bite into it , their stomachs explode . When people bite into it ... well who knows ! Two recent studies linked the pesticide toxins in the corn to human cell membrane death and the death of neonatal kidney cells . A study done in Canada found the Bt toxins in the blood serum of 93 % of pregnant women tested , and 80 % of their unborn babies . The FDA lets the chemical companies decide if they 're safe - there is no requirement for long term , independent , peer reviewed studies to test it before it gets into your food . There are 50 countries around the world that require products to be labeled when they contain genetically modified ingredients ... all of Europe , China ( ! ) , Japan , Russia ( ! ) , Australia , New Zealand , Brazil , India and more . In the US , there is no labeling law . We hit the jackpot ! We have Michael Taylor appointed as our food safety czar and guess where he came from ! MONSANTO ... the number one chemical company creating and selling GMOs . To make it worse , they have also inserted foreign genes into the DNA of sugar , soy , canola and cottonseed . ( POP TARTS contain ALL of these - do n't buy them ! ) They 've made ALL of these GMOs resistant to high doses of an herbicide called RoundUp . ( Guess who also sells the RoundUp - you got it ! Monsanto ! ) The active chemical ingredient in RoundUp is called Glyphosate . If you google it , you 'll find that it 's linked to birth defects , cancer , inflammatory bowel disease and more . No wonder everyone seems to be getting sick ! Kellogg 's does n't want you to know any of this and they have recently contributed $ 632,500 to a propaganda campaign in California , where voters will be voting on Prop . 37 for the labeling of genetically engineered foods on November 6th . They are trying to trick people into voting against labeling by telling them its going to raise their grocery bills by $ 400 a year and other things which are totally untrue . None on the countries that have labeling laws have seen ANY increase in their food costs . Kellogg 's Frosted Flakes are no longer G-R-RRRRREAT . I would n't feed them to my family ... not to my pets either . BLECH .	-1
SodaStream cola is much less weight making it more cost effective to ship . SodaStream cola tastes so great so why would you want to drink this anymore . Plus u can put the SodaStream cola flavor on ice cream & use it to sweeten your cereal instead of milk . Soda Stream has just made a better cola than Coke . Too bad for Coke . Sodastream makes machines that use the 60L carbonating bottle & the 130L carbonating bottle . I use the fountain Jet that can use the 130L carbonating tank . I like the larger carbonating tank & get a spare . You can switch the 60L bottle out for a larger one when you exchange it . Also you will wan 2 use cold refrigerated water 2 carbonate with . some extra carbonating bottles that you put water in & keep in the fridge . Also get the MyWater flavors which are excellent with seltzer water which you now will be able to make . Try using less syrup to make the sodas than advised & you may prefer that . The MyWater flavors I just use a tiny drop per liter way less than the half a teaspoon recommended . Also the Sodastream ice sticks are great & can be used to cool water down for carbonating .	-1
Being a shy , backward person , it is truly difficult to tell my story , the story of a person suffering from near-necrotic epidermis . But I 'll give it my best and relate to you the shortcomings , nay , the failings of this product as a skin treatment.As difficult as it is to admit , I suffer from chronic , persistent Folliculitis . This horribly tragic skin affliction has been my curse since puberty and only grows worse by the year . It starts with small bumps , but with uncontrollable scratching and flaking , it has transformed my somewhat-normal skin into a leather-like covering that only serves to keep my veins , arteries and organs intact . At first it attacked only my arms and stomach and was easily hidden by longish-sleeved t-shirts . Winter was a godsend , as I could slink around fully clothed and the casual observer would never know my affliction . Keeping a calm demeanor and having passably handsome face , I would sometimes merit even the occasional approving nod or glance.All that has changed with time , however . Summer or winter , I must drag myself along like a strict Mormon in long sleeves and pants , envying all other humans as they laugh and play in short sleeves , tank tops or even go shirtless.Then I met Dr. Smetigonavitadong , my ayurvedic dermatologist . He assured me all would be cured if I 'd only bathe myself daily in whole milk , preferably Tuscan . Living outside the fringes of society , whole milk would be hard to find ( even moreso , whole milk of the Tuscan variety ) , but thanks to the internet and Amazon , I was able to procure said product in the form of Tuscan Whole Milk , 1 Gallon , 128 fluid ounces . I purchased several cases.Months have gone by and , disappointingly , I 've seen no change . Pustules and pimples remain , fetid and squamous as ever . And worse yet , I 've found that the good Doctor is an investor in the entire Tuscan Whole Milk financial scheme ! My embarrassment is complete , as I 've been taken by an ayurvedic quack ! Adding insult to injury , I have an entire cache of spoiling whole milk and I 'm lactose intolerant ! Now nights are spent reading Wikipedia to learn various cheese recipes . Any help would be appreciated from those residing in Wisconsin or of Swiss lineage .	-1
I saw this on sale at my local grocery store . I figured hey its Tuscan.. it must be quality . I was horribly wrong . As soon as i opened it , my daughter started to act a little strange as she quoted passages from the bible that i 've never heard before ( considering we are not a religious family ) . I just ignored it and had a bowl of frosted flakes . Two weeks later I find her bed ridden.. i figured she just wanted some 2 % . i attempted to pour some on her to snap her out of it . it boiled off her skin . Now she speaks in an old english tongue and i can not understand her . I am now writing a letter to Tuscan seeking damages in the form of coupons .	-1
It is appalling to me that anybody would think that Tuscan milk would be anywhere near as good as good old fashioned American milk ! These colors do n't run !	-1
It 's all well and good to indulge our creative writing and have a little fun at Amazon 's expense , but what do we really know about this so-called Tuscan Milk ? I will endeavor to prove that it is neither Tuscan nor milk.Everyone knows nascut ( an anagram and almost a backwards spelling exactly of t-u-s-c-a-n ) is Romanian for `` born '' ( specifically , the past participle of naste ) . So what we have here is a thinly veiled admission that this liquid has its origins in Eastern , rather than Southern , Europe , and thus offers a flavor more Balkan than Mediterranean . Transylvania to Tuscany is exactly one thousand miles , and allowing for the fact that the earth rotates on its axis one thousand miles per hour , is it any coincidence that Lao Tzu wrote , `` A journey of one thousand miles begins with a single step '' ? As for the question of color over origin , we are presented with no less of an obvious obfuscation . To be sure , the pictures of Tuscan Whole Milk , 1 Gallon , 128 fl oz appear as white as newly fallen arctic snow . But color theory teaches us that white is after all the combined color spectrum . Given the geographical and lexicographical insights above , are we hinting at vampiric energy drinks or merely an FDA investigation of immense , nay , bovine , proportions ? Either way I think I 'll have a good old fashionedMexican Coke ( 24 Pack ) instead .	-1
I 'm here to tell everyone the truth about this so called 'tuscan ' milk.It was my great grandfather , Pasquale Iandoli who originally perfected the recipe for a full bodied , incredibly satisfying milk beverage . It was a great success in his home town of Apice Benevento Italy , and brought with it large quanties of money . With that money , he was able to act as a supporter of Mussolini . Well , I do n't have to tell you that with the fall of facism , Pasquale had to leave Italy , and fast ! He only had one copy of the recipe with him and while traveling to America it was stolen by a shipmate . This person subsequently popularized it in the states , and ignorantly claims it to be 'Tuscan ' milk , when clearly it tastes distinctly of Napoli .	-1
I mean , $ 45 for a gallon of milk ? What is it ? Gold ? Did anyone actually buy this milk , or is it there for laughs ?	-1
If I could give Tuscan Whole Milk , 1 Gallon , 128 fl oz half a star , I would . Being an African American female with type 4a/4b textured hair , I have been on a years long journey to find something that would moisturize my tightly bound coils throughout the day . When my Tuscan Whole Milk , 1 Gallon , 128 fl oz arrived by mail I was ecstatic.The packaging was flawless , I noted that nothing had spilled en route . However , I was concerned that the jug-like design would make it difficult to apply this runny product to my locks . I did mitigate this by mixing the Tuscan Whole Milk , 1 Gallon , 128 fl oz with some shea butter and left over Kinky Curly Knot Today detangler.As expected , the mixture went into my roots a little white , so I sat under the dryer to allow it to set into my curls . The initial results were shiny , perfectly clumped ringlets ! Because I am a zoo keeper , I have to report rather early to work to feed various animals before they are handled in various demonstrations throughout the day . This particular weekend , I was on meerkat duty . By sunrise , the weather had begun to cool , and I noticed a little of the Tuscan Whole Milk , 1 Gallon , 128 fl oz dripping down the back of my neck . I took it a harmless and carried on , because I may have over applied the mixture , and made a note to use less in the future.Everything continued innocently enough , however within moments of entering the cage I was overrun by dozens of the small mammals ! I can not recall what happened after this moment , but there is news footage of meerkats chewing through my precious curls ! I recently completed my second big chop , and the damage has been done thanks to Tuscan Whole Milk , 1 Gallon , 128 fl oz . I am so disappointed that I have not yet found my holy grail product to make my curls pop , but I am grateful I still have my life in tact ! I would not recommend this to anyone who works with animals , however I ask that the manufacturers of Tuscan Whole Milk , 1 Gallon , 128 fl oz create a dairy free product or something less animal-friendly .	-1
Because I could not stop for milk , It kindly came to me.I ordered it through Amazon , Whole milk ; sweet Tuscany.The driver , though , he knew no haste , No Expediter , he ! The wait : Four days , and weekend , too.It seemed eternity.My milk , it passed through NYCWhere traffic snarled in rings , Slow past the fields of grazing cowsWho nodded knowingly.Its expiration date passed , too ; And though the truck was chill , Vile germs digested lactose sweetAnd had their gruesome fill.It paused before my house at last , ( By USPS Ground ) My gallon jug ; 128 ounceThough oddly swollen ` round.My joy is dashed !

OK , I admit I have a serious , anaphylactic milk allergy . But after reading the reviews here , I thought this product sounded so magically wonderful that I 'd give it a try anyway.Big mistake ! ! ! I 'm out of the hospital now and back at my computer , so that part 's good . And I did get a helicopter ride to a major medical center , even if I was n't awake for it.Still , all things considered , this product was a lousy purchase . The FDA needs to put a stop to the money-grubbing corporate monsters who market this stuff . Save your money , and save your life !	-1
Texas Pete is very average . It has too much of a peppery taste and is n't really that hot . In fact , I would describe the overall flavor as bland , not tasty at all . I have tried a lot of hot sauces , and while Texas Pete is not bad , it leaves me a little flat .	-1
Texas Pete 's is the # 1 hot sauce in the South - it 's ubiquitous in every type of restaurant . If you ask for Tabasco , you 're likely to get Texas Pete 's hot sauce instead . The company was founded in 1929 in Winston-Salem , North Carolina ; their first product was their barbecue sauce , but the hot sauce soon followed . This is a basic hot sauce - peppers , vinegar , and salt - and it can be used as you would Tabasco or a Louisiana hot sauce . Unfortunately , it 's extremely mild . I often find that , in order to add the desired heat to food , I have to add so much that the food becomes watery . My scrambled eggs end up a mess and still taste bland . If you like a mild hot sauce , then Texas Pete should be one of your top choices . Otherwise , avoid this wimpy selection.The company 's website includes a plethora of recipes using their products - the Chicken Brunswick Stew is a North Carolina tradition .	-1
I 've kept a bottle of Tabasco ( the original blend ) in my kitchen for more decades than I care to admit . I 've added a few drops to any number of dishes that I wanted to `` kick up '' a notch and used it regularly in a Bloody/Virgin Mary.I 'm embarrassed to say I never experimented with any other brand of hot sauce until recently.After taste testing over 40 different hot sauces ( everyone needs a hobby ) , writing up notes , test tasting them blind again - writing up new notes and then comparing my old notes versus new notes -- -- - I have to say Tabasco 's original blend turns out to be one of the worse hot sauces I have tested blind.Tabasco 's original has only two tastes : hot peppers combined with a very heavy dose of vinegar . The bitter vinegar after-taste , so typical in Tabasco 's original , is not an inherent quality of a good hot sauce.I could provide an extensive list of hot sauces that are far superior to Tabasco 's original but here are just a few that are widely available : I encourage you to try any or all of them . I 'm quite certain you will be pleasantly surprised.1 ) Huy Fong Sriracha Hot Chili Sauce ( as potent as Tabasco ) but with far less vinegar but a hint of sugar and garlic . Top rated by many.2 ) Cholula Hot Sauce ( milder and less vinegar ) - often highly rated by professional reviewers3 ) Tapatio Salsa Picante Hot Sauce ( milder and with less vinegar ) 4 ) Huichol Hot Sauce ( milder - less vinegar - not so widely available ) 5 ) Tabasco 's own Chipotle blend ( much milder - rich tasting featuring the chipotle smoked pepper -less vinegar ) I hope I 've encouraged everyone to try a few other hot sauces beyond this onePS : Once you get away from Tabasco 's ( original ) hot sauce and what I find to be its excessive vinegar after-taste you open up a whole new world . There are so many superior hot sauces available that it is almost impossible to comprehend . Things have certainly improved since the late 1800s when Tabasco first came to market . While Tabasco likes to brag that this is their original blend -- -- that is not a `` plus '' in my view but rather a `` minus '' - a marketing gimmick where they argue that an inherent flaw ( a lot of vinegar ) is an attribute . BTW : Less anyone think I have an axe to grind with Tabasco - see my review of Tabasco 's Chipotle hot sauce which I rated as excellent ! What more can I say - experiment - I sincerely doubt you will stick with Tabasco 's original hot sauce after trying a few other brands.UPDATE -- -- - A PROFESSIONAL REVIEW of Hot Sauces has come out : While my original review was written over a year prior - just recently America 's Test Kitchen , a show on PBS , TESTED a number of HOT SAUCES.What sauce came in FIRST ? -- -- -- Huy Fong Sriracha.What sauce came in very LAST ? -- -- TabascoI 'll admit it is nice to have a professional tasting panel come to the very same conclusions I arrived at a year earlier.Tastes vary and Tabasco will suit those who like a lot of vinegar in their hot sauce .	-1
I used to be a Tabasco fan . I really did.But after branching out and trying other sauces , I ca n't help but see how flawed it is . And I think its popularity is due not to its quality , but due to it being a recognizable brand.The quality shockingly is n't as high as you might think . In fact , I find it to be quite low-quality . After sampling many other sauces in the past few months ( I 'm going through a hot-sauce kick lately ) , Tabasco in retrospect comes off as quite cheap-tasting and with no real flavor . And the burn is n't natural . It tastes `` chemically . '' Mainly due to the fact that all you taste is vinegar . And to me , that 's not the mark of a good sauce . A good sauce should have a natural burn ( moreso like fire or radiating heat ) and a nice flavor to it . It should n't taste too vinegary and it definitely should n't have an artificial-feeling `` chemically '' burn . But that 's what Tabasco really tastes like when I really pay attention and analyze it.Just to make my analysis more fair and up-to-date , tonight I decided to do a taste-test with it and some of the others sauces I had on hand . I used about six different sauces in comparable amounts . Straight to the tongue . ( With a `` cool down '' period in between so I could clear my mouth out of the burn and flavor ) And classic Tabasco was the worst in terms of flavor . I hate to say that , because I know its popular due to its recognizable nature . But it was the worst by far . To the point I almost just tossed the whole bottle in the trash , because I do n't see myself using it ever . I did n't , since I figured I should have it on-hand for friends who may want some . But I definitely wo n't be using it again.I 'm quite saddened by how poorly classic Tabasco holds up . But do n't get me wrong . I do like some of their other available flavors a little bit . ( I think their Chipotle sauce is ok , because it at least has a slight touch of flavor , though again , it 's far too `` vinegary '' for its own good . ) But classic Tabasco is just very poor in retrospect.Low quality . No real flavor . Gross `` chemically '' burn . I 'd say branch out and try something new instead of going with the same-old Tabasco .	-1
Update : It appears that this may be at least partially fixed . In my case , it seemed to sort reviews so the relevant ones appear first . However , the nearly five star rating is still not broken down by product , so you can not tell if any specific product is getting lower ratings without reading every review . The products have to be treated completely separately , and they are still not , so the nearly five star rating is useless other than to say that McCormick overall has great products. -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- The way these seasonings are mixed into one , you would think whatever seasoning you purchase to be excellent , but unfortunately , because there are so many , there is no way to know.I thought coming to the review I was reading reviews on Saffron and realized the people were reviewing completely different products like lemon grass.These reviews are for McCormick seasoning in general , not the specific product , so if you are here reading this review because you thought you were reviewing a specific product , you are mistaken as I was.Not all products across the product line are the same quality and have widely varying costs , so reviewing them all as though they represented a single product is misleading at best .	-1
Hoping to try something different around the kitchen by adding some saffron to my beautiful dishes , I used what I got from McCormick in place of saffron to everyone 's surprise . Well , I guess that was a big mistake since my dear associates who actually made it out the door without soiling their Givenchy and Armani clothing most likely ended up doing it in their fancy super cars on each other in their way to their luxury pads on the hills . Needless to say they probably wo n't be back for next week 's Persian tongue delicacy that I am preparing for them with French dressing , `` shoot '' ... Reviewing so many food items as a single item is misleading practice by Amazon , not mentioning it `` Ruins Relationships '' . Next time I am getting my saffron directly from Pampore Kashmiri .	-1
I wish I had time to grow chives ( and the green thumb ) but since I do not I purchased McCormick 's freeze dried chives . I used them in 3 dinners this week and they do n't have much aroma or flavor . All they seem to do is add a little color . I would stick with the fresh chives from the grocery since these do n't seem to translate as well as McCormick 's rosemary , parsley or basil ( which I have tried and love )	-1
I tried roasting these seeds and then grinding them into a paste to be used to thicken Indian curries . Does n't seem to be effective .	-1
Beware , the chemical poison BHT included in small dosages as a way of preserving this item.enough bht buildup can damage your body and or worse . Most countries make it illegal for companies to sell foods containing bht . the USA is one of the few that put the businesses before it 's citizens and allow for such misconduct.hopefully you will read this and think seriously about yours families health and start paying attention to what is foods	-1
The true `` original '' is the UK version , which contains malt vinegar and spirit vinegar . This product is the US version , which contains distilled white vinegar instead . I 've compared both versions side by side and found that it 's even possible to _smell_ the difference . As you may well imagine , the difference in taste is considerable.Please note that this issue is entirely separate from the matter of the high-fructose corn syrup mentioned in so many other reviews . The US version no longer contains HFCS , but it 's still not the `` original '' -- and it 's not as pungent and strongly flavored as the true UK original.Use the UK version ( with the orange label ) and accept no substitutes . Especially when they lie and claim to be `` original . ''	-1
HFCS - High Fructose Corn Syrup - is processed differently by your body than sugar and is considerably worse . Do not trust the propaganda of the subsidized Big Ag in America for your truthful info on food.You can get an organic version from Annie 's .	-1
the title of this product is misleading , because you are NOT buying 100 % key lime juice , but some mystery blend of juices .	-1
The bottle says in small letters to refrigerate `` after purchase '' . What kind of c..p is that ? The carton ( yes , I was stupid enough to buy a dozen , does NOT say that . Well , the contents turned brown and we did not dare to use them.Shame on you , Nellie and Joe ! Never , ever again will we buy from you .	-1
Bought it for a guest.Tried it , even after reading the label.Horrible.I mean partially hydrogenated oils AND corn syrup ? Generally people who purchase a Sugar Free item expect the item to be at least someone healthier than the alternative . Regardless of the reasoning behind sugar avoidance , this actually has corn syrup , which is sugar ! Making the serving size small enough so that all of the & # 34 ; negative nutritional information & # 34 ; does not need to be registered on the label does n't mean that the average person who is consuming more than 2 teaspoons of this can multiply what is on the label and get anything in the ballpark as far as accurate on the nutritional information.It is just sad ... and I hope my friend stops using this . Real cream and cocoa would be much much yummier and healthier !	-1
Be warned : although the FDA label claims `` 0g trans fat '' the ingredients tell a different story , as `` partially hydrogenated coconut or palm kernel '' is the first ingredient listed . This is a poison that is now outlawed in New York restaurants , and if you are careful about what you eat you want to make sure you stay away from this.As it turns out , they can claim `` 0g trans fat '' because the content is less than 1g per serving , but it 's a technicality : the product contains a significant amount of trans fat.Obviously , you 're not going to drop dead from using a teaspoon in your coffee once , but regular , prolonged use is detrimental to your health . You 're better off staying away altogether anyway , and you may want to do what I did and contact Nestle consumer service to complain about their deceptive practices . This product can and should be made with healthier ingredients .	-1
Too sweet , I do n't know why but it is . It 's just not quite right . It could be due to the fact that it 's sugar free and in the quest to replicate a sugar based product , they overcompensated . Not sure , but it will take me months to finish this , if I finish it .	-1
Any product with hydrogenated vegetable oils is n't worth buying . The fact that they are pretending not do have any by using a low serving size and rounding down to get to `` 0 '' grams , makes this a scam . Shame on you Nestle.Hydrogenated oils have been banned in NY for a reason - they are poison for the human body . See the Wikipedia article on trans fats for more information . Here is a clip : `` Because of these facts and concerns , the NAS has concluded there is no safe level of trans fat consumption . There is no adequate level , recommended daily amount or tolerable upper limit for trans fats . This is because any incremental increase in trans fat intake increases the risk of coronary heart disease . [ 2 ] ``	-1
I purchased this 'bargain ' size but it resists being mixed into a hot cup of anything , resembling curdled milk or cream . Since there 's so much and it actually does not have the same rich mouth taste which is why I bought it to use with milk as a cheaper version of half and half ... .now I 'm thinking as I write this that maybe if I pre-mix this with boiled water and store it in the fridge like 'cream ' that the curdled issue will not be an issue.But otherwise , sometimes it pays to spend a bit more for something known and just enjoy it	-1
I do n't know what the deal is but these small bottles do n't taste good.The Larger size is a much better option.You can always fill the small container whenneeded.Got a 18oz from Amazon and it has much better flavor .	-1

I generally enjoy strong flavors but this spice mix ruined a seafood lasagna I made a few months ago . Perhaps it would be OK on chicken , but the lemon was overpowering and very unpleasant in the lasagna . For the first time in my 50 years of living I have thrown out a jar of spice as I can not use it ; the lemon is yucky and seems very artificial . Real lemon would not be anywhere near as intense . There are many much better spice mixes available , including other Mrs Dash products- but they are greatly overpriced .	-1
I recently bought Domino 10 lb premium cane sugar from a local grocery for about $ 8 and that makes a one lb batch around $ 0.8 . That is regular powder not cubes as this one but other than that it is exactly the same . In my book for a subtle difference in shape asking for 10x the price is a total rip off .	-1
I used to love it because it tasted great and it was reasonably priced . Now the price is astronomical and the taste is not as chokolaty and too sweet.I do not understand why it is so expensive now and why it is so sugary .	-1

I order this item two times on this subscribe and save and both times I had to throw it out . The Tea arrived damaged the bottom of the items were broken and tea was coming out of it .

This is a good brand of sugar . But my problem was with the packaging and shipping . I ordered two bags of this sugar and a few other things . When I received the box , I opened it and first thing I saw was one entire bag of sugar opened and spilled all over the entire box . I like this sugar more than any other but will not be wasting my money with this seller any more . The cost of this bag is also outrageous compared to being bought and any store . I paid almost $ 12 a bag and only received one usable bag . Not worth it . I can get this same exact bag at Wal-mart for $ 6 and some change or at Sam 's club for $ 4 and change.I just contacted Amazon and they gave me a full refund . Thank you Amazon for taking care of your customers .	-1
Amazon is treating all of McCormick organic Gourmet Collection spices as a single item review . This is why one can see so many different reviews about different spices in one place since a different spice can be selected by scrolling down the flavor option ... Different spices taste differently , originated differently and are different genetically . McCormick is an excellent brand , Amazon is the one that needs to get it together . Reviewing so many food items as though presented as a single product is misleading practice by Amazon .	-1
This rosemary is okay , I guess , I had hoped for more flavor but in that I have always used fresh rosemary I do n't think I am a very good judge .	-1
We have tried everything to get even one bag to come out correctly . Either it leaves LOTS of kernels in the bag and very little popcorn to eat OR it burns in big globs and at least 1/4 is burned . We give up ! Our microwave is 1200 watts and we have tried the popcorn button AND numerous times tried other times AND we stand there and listen to it . The kernels are still popping vigorously but it is burning inside . Enough is enough . What a shame because it is good tasting , what little we get from one bag , but too frustrating .	-1
When I ordered this popcorn , I was expecting a premium and organic popcorn with low sodium and low fat . It was none of those . It was excessively salty and greasy and , for those of you who like their popcorn with salt and butter , you might like it . I prefer mine dryer where I can choose to add my own oil or butter and my own salt or none of those . I wo n't buy it again .	-1
This popcorn does pop up well with very few hulls . However , it has little to no butter flavor and has a strange taste that I could n't grow accustomed to . I ate three boxes , trying to convince myself that the flavor would grow on me , before deciding that I was never going to get used to it and the calories were n't worth it . I added butter , flavorings , parmesan cheese , but no luck . Too bad you ca n't return unused boxes ! I ended up giving the rest of it away . A very expensive taste test !	-1
I agree with the review about the strange taste . I LOVE LOVE Black Jewell NATURAL flavor popcorn so I decided to try the Butter one . It popped up fine but it just has a weird taste ! Even my popcorn loving 12yr old said something was wrong with the flavor . I ordered 6 boxes ... do n't know what I am going to do with the 5 boxes left ... maybe donate ? : - ( I will continue to buy the Natural by the case and butter it myself .	-1
I 'm a big popcorn fan and have tried many brands . I tried this one because the best , BKH popcorn has gone out of business . I like the hullless kind and they not only had the best but the largest popped kernels . In addition to that on the average 99 % popped . The Black Jewel had like 25 % not popped and anymore then 2 min in the microwave made it burn . The popped kernels were very small , hardly nothing to eat . The flavor was good but certainly not worth ever buying again . If anyone knows the BKH brand and can suggest one like it let me know .	-1
I wo n't pretend to be an expert on olive oils ; but I will attest to being a family cook and consumer of olive oils and this one did not strike me as quite what I was expecting . The first whiff gives a hint of stale and when blind-taste-tested in my home kitchen by my husband , my ten year old and me- dipping crusty sourdough bread-straight-up , no herbs , no garlic no other flavors- 2 out of 3 of us selected the OTHER first-cold-pressed , Virgin Olive Oil from Italy ; we were trying to buy more American stuffs but will stick with our imported Italian olive oils for now . OK , for me , this one is fine for sauteeing- just not the best fresh flavor for dipping or dressings . In case it it matters substantially- the bottle indicates : 'Harvested Fall '07 and Bottled 6-21-08 '	-1
I received the olive oil and no where on the bottle does it say this product is organic , and obviously does not have the USDA/ORGANIC seal of approval.I went to their website but when I clicked on the various categories , even the `` CONTACT '' one , nothing came up on any of them.Contacted Amazon about there being no guarantee this is true organic olive oil and they gave me a full refund in less that 12 hours . Great service , as always ! ! !	-1
I have to agree with the sizeable minority here that this olive oil is just too bitter ( at least the Fall 08 bottling ) . The flavor starts a bit grassy , but then a flat , mouth-puckering astringency takes over . At first I hoped that the bitterness would mellow with a little shelf time , but after year in a cool , dark place the flavor is the same . I consider myself a foodie and I love strong flavors , but this oil 's bitterness is just so strong that it overpowers any other qualities . I have tried a variety of premium olive oils from the California , Europe , and Australia and have never experienced such an unbalanced olive oil . Given the number of good reviews out there , I hope I just got a bad batch .	-1
had high expectations with the great reviews , but wondering if people are being sucked in by the old family run , traditional process hype , and a very high price- like it must be the best ; i found it flat to the taste , slightly bitter in cooking something simple , and slightly soapy even with good pasta ; good extra virgin should have a melt in your mouth aroma at first heating , a rich , complex taste ; this just does n't ; buy a store bottle at the s'market and you would not know the difference cooking ; this product does n't measure up to a good imported italian extra virgin	-1
Now , please bear in mind that taste is highly subjective and just because I did not like this fruitcake - and I 'm a fruitcake lover - does n't mean that you or someone else might not enjoy it . Here are the reasons I did n't like it : I like pecans , or even walnuts in fruitcake , and this recipe uses almonds . The almonds added nothing to the taste , and the texture was obtrusive . In the middle of a bite of fruitcake , there is a rather hard , chewy almond to deal with . Not pleasant . And there were a lot of almonds . The ironic thing is that this fruitcake is made in Georgia and I believe Georgia grows pecans , my favorite . Next , I found the cake to be rather dry compared to other fruitcakes . And last of all , I have to agree with my friend who said & # 34 ; it seems to be missing something & # 34 ; . Maybe the something missing is the alcoholic beverage flavoring most fruitcakes , I do n't know . Anyway , I love fruitcakes but I will not order this one again .	-1
I 've never tasted the Stevia powders and the drink recipe I made only called for half a pack in a cup of green tea . Sure wish I had not added it because the entire drink went down the drain . The taste was so strong that I just could not get past it . Takes some getting used to but not for me .	-1
This is not pure stevia . Buying stevia for the benefits is not what this product does . MALTODEXTRIN is the number one main ingredient and , by the way , stevia was added to it . I have been using pure stevia products for 20+ years and always read my ingredients . I wish companies would stop fooling people into believing they now have the miracle sweetener . Its just like making donuts and adding a touch of stevia ! revised review bc . I had mixed up 5 star rating of another stevia product WHICH IS PURE STEVIA ( and accidentally gave it a one star rating ) THIS DESERVES a zero rating bc . it a product with the main ingredients being SUGAR with stevia added to it	-1
Something has changed drastically for the worse . You need a lot more of this product to attain the same sweetness , plus now it is bitter . All in my last couple of canisters . Looks like from other reviews that the product has been changed . Too bad ! Used to be a great product ! -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- OLD REVIEWHave tried a few stevia powders and liquids - this one seems to lack some of the bitterness that others left in my mouth . The powder is convenient . Price on amazon is cheaper than my local health food store which carries it for $ 23.99 and Wegman 's which carries it for $ 19.99 . Despite liking this for cold drinks and sweetening yogurt and the such , I am still not a fan of this in warm drinks ( coffee , tea , cocoa ) and taste a bitterness there . My husband does n't have the same experience that I do with warm drinks and says it is just fine .	-1
I tasted this product at a friend 's house . I had to use a lot more of it than I do with pure stevia , and I realized why when I examined the product label and researched information on the product on the NuNaturals website . This product is mostly maltodextrin . This is what is stated in the product information from NuNaturals : `` Add NuStevia to sweeten your favorite food or beverage , 1/4 tsp is as sweet as 1 tsp of sugar . For recipes , 4 tbs [ 1/4 cup ] is as sweet as 1 cup of sugar . `` Pure stevia powder is presumed to be 200 times as sweet as sugar . Individual perceptions of sweetness may vary , but I personally find the best brands of pure stevia to be about 40 times as sweet as sugar . Given that the stevia powder used in this product is at best , per the company 's own admission , only about 4 times as sweet as sugar , that means that this product is only about one-tenth stevia.For my own consumption , I much prefer to purchase100 % pure stevia powder . I 'm not a fan of maltodextrin mixed with stevia , and certainly not of natural flavors added to any food I consume which are , for reasons unknown , added to this product . I explain what those ingredients are below.Ingredients : Maltodextrin , stevia extract and natural flavors . Free of soy , MSG , yeast , gluten , wheat , milk , synthetics , artificial colors or flavors , preservatives , saccharin , aspartame , sucralose , or artificial sweeteners.Maltodextrin : This is a food additive that is either without taste or slightly sweet . It is commonly used in the processed-food industry as a thickener or filler , to improve the texture and appearance in processed food . As a relatively cheap ingredient , it can also add more bulk to a given product , thereby increasing profits for the company using it . In the U.S. , most of the time it is derived from rice , corn , or potato starch . Through a process called hydrolysis , the starch is reduced to its basic amino acids . Then an enzyme is used to break it down even further , resulting in a powder that instantly dissolves in water . Products such as jams and powdered substances which contain maltodextrin are required by law to say `` wheat '' in the the nutrition labeling if the maltodextrin is derived from wheat.Natural Flavor : The definition of natural flavor under the Code of Federal Regulations is : `` The essential oil , oleoresin , essence or extractive , protein hydrolysate , distillate , or any product of roasting , heating or enzymolysis , which contains the flavoring constituents derived from a spice , fruit or fruit juice , vegetable or vegetable juice , edible yeast , herb , bark , bud , root , leaf or similar plant material , meat , seafood , poultry , eggs , dairy products , or fermentation products thereof , whose significant function in food is flavoring rather than nutritional '' ( 21CFR101.22 ) . That essentially means that natural flavor is derived from a real food , but the process by which it is derived is unexplained and there is no way to know how safe or healthy a natural flavoring is .	-1
I started using this stevia about a year ago and was really impressed . I just finished my last bottle from the old formula and started this new one I had just ordered - YUK . It has an aftertaste like aspartame ( and I should know , I 've used artificial sweeteners for 40 years ) . The only thing I would recommend about this product is for Nunaturals to change back to their old formula . I 'm already looking for a new brand to try and wo n't wait until I finish this one which was a waste of good money .	-1
because of the shape of the crystals makes it is difficult to get a even spread . Some parts of your steak are saltier than others . It does have a nice crunch but the taste is not so special , to my buds anyway . I prefer French Grey Salt for taste and since it is a fine grain it can be 'applied ' evenly . Not to mention the price 17 bucks for 5 lbs delivered .	-1
The taste/flavor is some too strong and some people may not like them , make take some time to adjust to that . In all actuality I wo n't buy anymore but wanted to try them .	-1
This product was fine quality-wise but I am writing this for other food-adventurers who like to try new things : this product is about 50 % nori flakes . Rather than a seasoning with just a hint of nori to it ( what I was hoping for ) , this is nori with other seasonings ( and all I could taste was the bitter nori ) .If you love nori ( or sushi ) then read other reviews to decide whether or not this is for you	-1
I figured sooner or later there would be a Tazo tea I did not like . It has an overly sweet , artificial taste to it . I got past the blood red color and really wanted to like this tea . Will be giving this to a friend who may like it more . Luckily , I only paid $ 2.99 for a box of 20 at my local Homegoods who had lots of Tazo , Mightly Leaf and other brands on display from 2.99 - 5.99 .	-1
This tea has a strong , artificial orange flavor . It tastes like Tang seriously . If you have n't tried Tang , take orange candy and dip it in a cup of water . Tazo must have been very unmotivated when it created this flavor . Maybe kids will like it .	-1

It tastes okay - not as good as traditional soy sauce , but a decent substitute in recipes calling for it . I used it for a few weeks before finally looking more closely at the label . Kikkoman Soy Sauce has 920mg of sodium per serving . Low Sodium Kikkoman Soy Sauce has 575mg per serving . Bragg 's has 160mg per serving . However , all the soy sauces I checked have a serving size of one tablespoon . Bragg 's serving size is HALF A TEASPOON ! This makes it 960mg in an equivalent serving - more than regular soy sauce ! I was shocked , and then angry.Every `` substitute '' product - whether low fat , low sodium , higher fiber , whatever - I have ever tried before now has the same serving size as the product it is recommended in place of . Not only is this not equivalent , it is a ridiculous serving size . I could not find another liquid condiment of any type ( ketchup , mustard , steak sauce , salad dressing , ginger sauce , etc . ) that had a serving size smaller than one tablespoon , and many are two tablespoons . Not only is regular soy sauce lower in sodium , but obviously the low sodium options from name brands like Kikkoman or La Choy are significantly lower.There are many other seasoning options that are lower in sodium than this . If you like the taste , that is one thing . However , if you are looking to lower your sodium intake this is not a good product . Further , I feel that THE SERVING SIZE IS DESIGNED TO DECEIVE CUSTOMERS , and I will not be trying another Bragg product ever again .	-1
I have used Bragg 's products since 1967 . Now I 'm questioning their quality . Feb 5 I received Bragg 's Liquid Aminos 32oz All Purpose Seasoning ( Best by Aug 23 , 2016 ) . There was liquid inside the plastic bag . The protective seal was on but when I opened the cap , there was an index shape puncture in the seal . I called Bragg and was told none of their employees would do something like that ! They told me to talk to Amazon . Amazon had another bottle ( no date printed on bottle ) shipped and received Feb 6 . ( You Rocks , Amazon ! ! ! ) The seal on the new bottle was broken and about 1/4 cup of the liquid was inside the plastic and some had leaked into the box and left a large spot on the carpet in front of my door .	-1
They are probably fine for baking ; but were not what I was looking for . We used to get powdered eggs from government surplusfoods for the low income when I was a kid up in New Hampshire . I used to like the way they tasted as scrambled eggs ; they hada unique taste I do n't know how to describe , but I liked them . These did not taste anything like I remembered those powdered eggstasting . They probably do n't make them anymore .	-1
I have an Indian ( American ) friend , that gets free whole powdered eggs from the gov commodity program . She has often made me `` yummy/flavorfull '' egg sandwiches ( i.e . scrambled eggs ... ) ! I decided to buy some Honeyville & try it ? What a disappointment for scrambled eggs ( do n't know about baking ... ? ) ! 1 . Their is NO flavor , whatsoever ! ! ! 2 . Sticks `` hard '' to oiled stainless frying pan ( fried like a pancake . pre-heated to med/low ) - Worked better when I mixed in 1tsp of Canola oil , per egg ... ( like waffles ... ) .For 1 egg sandwich- I mix 1/4 cup water , to 1/4 cup mix ( they say 2-1 ) , which was a runny mess ( maybe for baking ? ) .Limited shelf life ... - I store unused mix in the freezer !	-1
Dehydrated Banana Chips - 2 Pound Can . Did not like it - could not fine a way to use them . Probable would be OK if you were really stuck living outside with not much to eat .	-1
I purchased this from Honeyville , since it was suggested in a review & was a little less expensive . I made banana bread with this first , as a test . Because if the banana bread I love does n't come out right , then nothing will . The banana bread was bad . It was grainy & bland & you can taste it . And it looked weird . The texture was off . I make amazing banana bread ! I threw it out . I 've never used anything but regular flour to bake , so I thought I would try this almond flour since it 's suppose to be much healthier w/much less carbs . I thought it might be a miracle flour ... but it 's not . I have yet to find anything w/less carbs , or less sugar , or less this and lighter that , that tastes good . Life 's too short not to have decent banana bread .	-1
I was excited to find this almond flour because it 's much less expensive than other brands and because it 's so highly rated . I use a lot of almond flour , so I did n't hesitate to order five pounds of it . When it arrived , however , the flour was full of hard lumps . I finally worked my way to the end of it and I 'm glad to see it gone . Some of the lumps were so huge they filled a quarter cup measure . So , I had to spend a great deal of my scarce baking time mashing lumps out of the almond flour with a fork . I tried measuring by weight instead of volume so I did n't have to work out the lumps first , but even whirring it around in the food processor only managed to break the huge lumps into smaller lumps . I wo n't buy this again .	-1
I could certainly go on for more than 20 words about how much I hated this coffee . Fortunately I did n't pay for it because it came with my machine as a sampler . Yuck ! It does n't taste like good coffee and it does n't taste like French Vanilla . Point blank I could n't even finish the cup and had to pour it down the drain . The aftertaste is even worse . I do n't understand how anyone could give this a positive review but I guess it 's all a matter of individual preference .	-1
I do love my Keurig coffee machine , and have sampled a wide variety of coffee flavors they offer . This one is NOT one of my favorites . It 's acidic , and that overpowers the vanilla and coffee flavors . You can do much better . The two best I 've tried so far are Green Mountain Wild Mountain Blueberry and Gloria Jean 's Mudslide ( chocolatey ) . If vanilla is your favorite flavor , I would try the Green Mountain or Gloria Jean version , or one of the others .	-1
Spectrum Light Canola Mayo is an eggless mayonnaise substitute . I bought a jar of this at my local store , as it was on clearance and I 'm trying to avoid eating real egg products . It has a very good smell , like real mayonnaise ; however , I was put off by its gummy texture . It has a passable flavor-somewhat tangy like the real stuff-but it also tastes very floury . The biggest downside to this mayo is that it leaves a terrible aftertaste for hours . I wo n't be buying this mayonnaise again .	-1
I 'm unimpressed with these . They are incredibly dense , so if you want to lose weight , avoid these . They do taste OK , but not great . I 've had better tasting granola bars .	-1
We truly wasted our money on this 6-pack of Kashi chewy granola bars in the Dark Mocha Almond flavor . Our family always has liked Kashi products , but this one was simply dry and stale . We did n't even finish one box , and we discarded the remaining . I am not sure if it was a Kashi problem or a stale fulfillment issue . Not recommended .	-1
they do not have much flavor . They also would stick in my child 's teeth and make it hard to shallow them .	-1
Gim me better ingredients ( KIND/Larabars ) for more $ or sweeter items ( genuine junk ) for less $ . Not sure I 'd invest in a single bar again , let alone this size .	-1
Compared to Natural Valley protein bars ( Peanut , Almond , Dark Chocolate , specifically ) , the texture is much less nutty , and more like bark . Too little chocolate flavor .	-1
It tastes like cardboard with a subtle flavoring of mocha . The granola bar is so dry and tasteless , I have to drink something with it in order to even swallow . I love most Kashi products , but this one fails imho .	-1
Kellogg agreed to remove & # 8220 ; all natural & # 8221 ; labeling from its line of Kashi and Bear Naked products , which the lawsuit claimed contain several artificial ingredients . In addition , they 're setting aside $ 5 million in a fund to dole out 50-cent refunds to Kashi customers and $ 325,000 for Bear Naked customers . They do not seem to disclose all ingredients and after further research , apparently Kashi is owned by Kellogg and donated some $ 790,700 dollars to defeat prop 37 , GM labelling in CA . The question is why would n't they want me to know the exact ingredients , after all I am paying for the product .	-1
These have no taste whatsoever ... no sweetness , no saltiness , nothing ! And chewy ? ? I nearly break my teeth trying to bite into them ! I guess I 'm gon na have to develop a taste for them because I just bought six boxes of them : ( My mistake .	-1
I got these for my daughter who prefers chewy to crunchy . I generally love Kashi stuff , but these were a disappointment . Even my daughter said yuck .	-1
I like Kashi products in general , but this bar is too sweet nor was there any crunchy bits of anything . It is a chewy bar , but does not give your jaws the same workout their turtle bar does which was a relief . I think I 'll stick the their cereals and granola bars . As for protein bars , I much prefer Balance bars .	-1
These are good in terms of protein and fiber . They are horrid in terms of taste -- coated with a sickly sweet icing and excessively flavored .	-1
Holy poop ! ! wish I would have checked that before I ordered them ! ! How exactly does adding 13 grams of sugar help your blood sugar level ? ? I checked that AFTER I tasted one because they taste like what I would imagine heavily salted wood chips to taste like ! ! What a hoax ! ! ! I am found this HEALYH FOOD to be counter productive to blood sugar and high blood pressure..I threw them out ! ! !	-1
Anyone who really loves a gourmet cup of coffee will HATE this ! It 's burnt , bitter , weak , battery-acid ! And , as consequence , those coffee lovers may begin to hate their new Senseo -- but take heart ! Many online coffee shops now offer decent to delectable coffees at prices that rival this cheap swill . I do n't specifically want to endorse any one product or online retailer but do a google search for `` senseo compatible pods '' and you 'll find several on the first page . Also , please note that while these may initially seem pricier , most third party pods work with JUST ONE to make an 8-ounce cup instead of the two pods that Senseo brand products demand . You do the math and it works out to be a comparable costing cup of joe. [ ... ]	-1
Now keep in mind that I 'm kind of a coffee snob , but I rarely have time to grind and press my own coffee . I use the Senseo pods simply for convenience sake . And since they have different flavors , I figured I 'd give them a try.Now Senseo coffee in general tends to be better than most any store pre-ground , canned , or mass produced brand , like Folgers or Maxwell House . But that 's not saying a whole lot . I find these to be kind of bitter , but the one saving grace is that I like the frothy finish.My biggest complaint is the inconsistency . When I initially wrote this review , I was drinking my first package that came in a four-pack . It actually tasted kind of fresh , and I liked it . However , the next two packages were quite stale . I have now tried a different brand of coffee pod which really blows this one out of the water.One to help make better coffee with your Senseo coffee maker : Do n't brew as soon as the red light stops flashing . Let it warm up a few more minutes before you hit the brew button.Also , there are some pretty good pods out there , and they are not expensive . You can even get fair trade and organic blends along with single origin coffees . Shop around . The Senseo brand pods are about the worst pods I 've tried , but since they are better than Folgiers , I give them two stars .	-1
I was really happy to see this coffee for such a great price . I even got a better price using the additional Senseo coupon code.As soon as I got the pods I brewed my first cup of . . . `` the weakest coffee ever except for when I forgot to add the coffee to the coffee maker . '' I was really disappointed.After reading the package I discovered I could use two pods to improve the flavor . Of course this also doubled the price making the deal not so good after all . Using two pods was a little too strong for my taste . Senseo rates the coffee as between mild and med . It was VERY , VERY mild ! In all fairness to this product , I purchased these pods to use with my EZ-Cup in my Keurig . So perhaps they would make better tasting coffee in the Senseo pod coffee maker .	-1
Flat coffee taste , artificial vanilla , blah . Of all the pods I 've tried in my Senseo , these are the worst .	-1
Althouh I love Senseo coffees for the most part , I did n't care for this one at all . It has a smokey , burnt flavor to me that tastes like coffee that 's been sitting out for hours . Plus I had the same problems others mentioned with torn pods that contaminated the rest of the bag and what a mess that was ! I wo n't be buying this kind again .	-1
I wanted to try a flavored coffee pod for my Senseo machine . I purchased hazelnut and was disappointed that I could n't taste any hazelnut flavor at all ! It does n't taste bad , but it tastes just like regular coffee with no hint of hazelnut . What 's with that ?	-1
The brand of Senseo that came with my little coffee pod machine was stronger than I liked so I tried a four pack of Columbiacoffee and the first pod was so strong that it upset my stomach . The next two were terrible and I dumped both cups . Since then I have tried diluting each pod with some water but the rotten taste persists . I bought a large coffee at a popular drive in and it was really strong and would have been refused back in the WWII era . NEEDLESS TO SAY , NEVER ANOTHER SENSEO COFFEE POD IN MY HOUSE , EVER AGAIN ! I do n't blame Amazon for my mistakes but it really irks me to throw out twenty some dollars worth of worthless SENSEO coffee pods . Will keep the pod machine to heat water for tea . My suggestion is for people to buy coffee and filters from your local stores , at least most of it is drinkable and so much cheaper !	-1
I bought this thinking that the coffee was a blend of Sumatran coffee beans . It is n't . It is ( it says ) at least 50 % Sumatran blended with other coffees . They do n't mention what other coffees . Could be coffee grown in New Jersey for all one knows . It does have a good flavor but I think the label should clearly state 50 % Sumatran Coffee Blend and not put it in small print on the side . I think it is kind of sneaky , but I am sure legal , to label it just Sumatra Blend . One has to wonder what the flavor would be like if it were all Sumatran coffee.update : I wind up using two pods in my Bunn MyCafe machine which says two things . First off , they are the only pods thin enough to place two into my Bunn so there is less coffee in them and secondly , that using only one pod makes for a weak cup of coffee . After I got these , I got Java One Sumatra pods and Wolfgang Puck Sumatra pods . Both are superior and only requires one pod to make a good cup of coffee . I do like the Puck pods the best .	-1
The only taste you will get from these pods are faint vanilla . You need two pods to make a cup of coffee and even with the two pods it does not taste like coffee . It tastes like watered down coffee with a fake vanilla flavoring .	-1
If you are looking for a Kona blend that actually tastes like a Kona blend , pass this one by . Maybe it sat next to a bag of Kona in the warehouse , but that 's about as close as it comes.Kona is smooth , and never bitter . This stuff just tastes like an ordinary slightly bitter medium roast coffee . Wo n't be buying this again ...	-1
These are okay , but I prefer Target 's Archer Farms brand coffee pods much more . They cost less , are bigger , individually wrapped and produce a much smoother coffee with real vanilla flavor .	-1
I bought these Nature 's Hallow Sugar Free Bllueberry Jams last year and they were really delicious . Plus they were sugar free with all natural and organic xylitol for sweetener . BUT ... ..I just purchased a case of them and they were grossly spoiled . One jar arrived opened and leaking all over the package so I threw it out . The second and third jars I opened were thick with globs of fungus encrusted blueberry 's and smelled awful . Needless to say , I threw them out ... ... that 's thirty dollars wasted . A fourth jar smelled ok and after tasting a little of it to make sure it would n't make me sick , it turned out to be ok ... .at least I am still hoping so . I am actually afraid to open the remaining jars . It 's like the company had a few really old jars left and sent them to me to clean out their inventory . Well , I can tell you that they have lost me as a customer . I use to buy their cookies for my old uncle but NO MORE . He is old and might not recognize if they are spoiled , loaded with fungus , or rancid . I wo n't be responsible for his demise by buying from an unethical company . I already told the company about the opened jar upon arrival but I had n't opened any more at that time . I do n't expect to hear from them ! I definitely DO NOT recommend this company any more . Beware !	-1
I should have paid closer attention to the product ( jar ) size , that 's my fault . It is a tiny jar , ten ounces . This equates to somewhere close to 2 bucks for a tablespoon full . ( I paid 14 dollars for the jar ) As for the taste , The jam is VERY good , and I guess if you 're a billionaire , or maybe a federal employee ( joking ) you could afford it . As for me , I guess I 'll have to go back to the store brand . Yikes ! I do wonder in an effort to be fair if I should reconsider the number of stars I gave the product , considering how good it is , what do you think ?	-1
Kashmir Spinach is the third Tasty Bite offering I have tried.The look and taste is quite unappealing.We would not consider buying it again.We had high hopes based on how much we loved other Tasty Bite items we tried , but no luck with this one.I encourage you to try Agra Peas or Jaipur Vegetables instead , two Tasty Bite items that are really fantastic .	-1
Perhaps I got a bad batch . This was n't at all like the madras lentils enjoyed at Indian restaurants . It was watery , too salty , and there were not many lentils . It was like a watery soup , and not like the picture on the package or like a lentil stew .	-1
I recently paid $ 4.80 for a 4-pack ( same size packs , same product ) . The product is pretty good ... kind of a dal-sort-of-thing , but I can not see forking over such $ $ $ here for it . Look elsewhere !	-1
I could n't finish it . The flavor made me sick . It just tastes wrong ...	-1
I know it is good for you and will give a really good try to get use to this taste . I love roasted seasoned seaweed , so that is n't the reason , just so different then expected . Leaves little particles in your mouth , so the kelp flavor can linger , linger .	-1
1 ) these candy bars were apparently made for overseas distribution but never got there . I ordered from a company in Mass . figuring that all the reviews talking about candy with asian/indian language on the wrapper might be avoided but it was not . Seems you will get these `` overseas '' bars wherever you get them from.2 ) I wanted the VIOLET CRUMBLE but it is not available in the US anymore . Some reviewed these and said these bars were close to if not better than the VC . I disagree greatly . Although they are both a form of `` sponge '' candy with a chocolate covering , this bar does not come close to the VIOLET CRUBMLE . The `` sponge '' center only makes me think the word STALE , and the chocolate has something wrong with it . Not even close to the quality of the chocolate used on the VC . Indeed after just a small sampling from the first bar , I was so disappointed I tossed them all in the garbage.Too bad . Guess I 'll keep on looking for the VC . Hail Flavius !	-1
I was expecting something a little softer , like actual honeycomb . Whatever the center was made of was hard as rocks , so either it was super stale , or not at all honeycomb . The chocolate covering was so-so . Overall , these were pretty meh .	-1
This product and company are AWFUL ! ! ! I researched to make sure this product was GF and safe for our family with Celiac to ingest as a dietary supplement to help with leaky gut . I could only order a 6-pack directly from the company , but figured that was fine as this product gets such rave reviews . 2 days into using 1 tsp a day per person in a hot lemonade drink -- -we were SICK with glutening symptoms . Bad symptoms . Within 2 days of not ingesting this product , we got better . Not to mention the taste and smell of the gelatin itself is absolutely DISGUSTING -- -It literally tastes like eating smelly , boiled shoes . I called the company to report our problems , and the woman on the phone was extremely rude and belligerent -- -insisting that there was NO way the gelatin made us sick and perhaps my kitchen was just dirty . really ? ! She would NOT refund my money unless I paid a 15 % restocking fee -- -even though the product made us sick ! ! ! The gelatin is made from boiled cow hides from Argentina and made in Argentina also . This product is horrible , this company is horrible and I would n't even let my worst enemy eat this toxic garbage ! I was SO angry after my phone conversation with this company -- I ca n't even get myself to send the 6 cans back because I do n't trust them . Perhaps I can sell them online myself ?	-1
Ate one Truffette and it tasted terrible , ate a second to make sure that the first was n't a fluke , and the second tasted even worse . They have the sickening taste of moldy bitter sweet chocolate used in making chocolate fudge . They are not sweet nor tasty in any sense of the word . They leave a bad taste in my mouth and an unpleasant feeling in my stomache . I will never again pay any attention to the reviews on Amazon . How anyone could report that this awfull concoction is good or great is far beyond me . I may have received a bad lot , but I doubt it . Obviously , a number of reviewers of this product who rated it four or five stars would rate cow dung as delicious . Buy a fifty cent candy bar at your local food store instead of purchasing this awful concoction , at least they taste sweet and do n't leave you rushing to the frig for something to kill the taste of Chocmod Truffettes .	-1
I tried cocoa dusted chocolate truffles once and they were magnificent . I do n't remember the brand , but I was hoping these would be just as good . Unfortunately , these are really mediocre . There is no luscious chocolate flavor -- very bland . Even my 12 year old who loves chocolate said these were `` just okay '' .I 'll have to continue my search for delicious chocolate truffles elsewhere .	-1
Buyer Beware Please ! This sweetner is not for everybody . Maltitol is an alcohol sugar and can be undigestible in the body . You will know a short time after consuming it if you are one of the unsuspecting many who can not digest it by the extreme intestinal bloating and cramping and massive amounts of gas a person can experience . Nausea , diarrhea & headaches can also be experienced . I learned my lesson the hard way years ago when I fell in love with the sugar-free chocolates suzanne sommers used to sell . I thought I 'd found sugar-free chocolate nirvana at first taste but the bliss was short lived when the terrible side effects of maltitol kicked in . The discomfort was unlike anything I had ever felt before . I blew up like a balloon and had very painful abdominal cramping . As the symptoms passed , this too was very unpleasant . Though hard for me to believe a low calorie sweetner could be the culprit , all symptoms were gone when I stopped eating the chocolate . My hunch it had something to do with the maltitol were unfortunately confirmed for me about a year later when I purchased some delicious sugar-free popcorn at my local market . The taste was amazing and while I was looking at the label wondering what could possibly make this yummy , new sugarfree treat taste so good , my heart sank when I followed the little asterisk next to sugarfree sweetner* down to the very bottom of the label and read `` maltitol '' in tiny little letters ! Thank goodness I 'd eaten only a little . I still ended up with all the same side-effects but for a much shorter duration . Some people can use maltitol to their heart 's content but others , like me , can have a bad reaction to it . In case you 're like me , ... it 's not you ... it 's the maltitol !	-1
This is a mild hot sauce . That means you can apply it liberally and it 's unlikely you will make any dish too hot . So it is user friendly.Ingredients ( as copied from the label ) : Aged cayenne peppers , distilled vinegar , water , salt - etcWhy 2 stars ? This sauce lacks any character beyond a heavy dose of vinegar . If you happen to like a lot of vinegar in your hot sauce - then you 'll love this sauce and my 2 star rating is way off base . I do n't like anywhere near this much vinegar . I 've blind taste tested over 30 hot sauces and there are many better ones.What is interesting is that the original Tabasco sauce has a near identical taste to Franks once it is diluted.You will find mention that this sauce was top rated by Cooks Illustrated . That is absolutely true but what these pundits fail to mention is this was a casual test , done in 2005 , comparing only three hot sauces ! Suggestion : Since tastes vary and if you happen to like this sauce - then buy it in one of its larger sizes - at least 23 oz and consider the gallon size . They cost little more than the smaller sizes.I 'd encourage others to experiment with a sauce that is not so heavily laden with vinegar - you just might prefer any of these : a ) Huy Fong Sriracha Hot Chili Sauce - This sauce has considerable heat but it is nicely balanced against a bit of sweetness combined with a hint of garlic . Virtually every supermarket carries it - look in the Asian section ! No vinegar.b ) Cholula Original Hot Sauce - features a fine blend of peppers - medium hot and readily available - look in the Mexican section . It has a hint of vinegar.c ) Valentina Salsa Picante Mexican Extra Hot Sauce - a great blend with more vinegar than the above but not too much . Another great blend.d ) Valentina Salsa Picante Mexican Hot Sauce - a decent blend but with a lot of vinegar . Still it is much better than Franks.e ) Tapatio Hot Salsa Picanta - another widely distributed and excellent Mexican Hot sauce . A lot of vinegar but far less than Franks . Once again you will find this in your Mexican isle.In my opinion , all of the above are far superior to Franks.If you like Franks and are at the least bit curious , you should try any of these other hot saucesUPDATE ( August , 2013 ) America 's Test Kitchen which is a TV program on PBS recently rated hot sauces . Tabasco came in last , Franks came in the middle and top rated was Huy Fong Sriracha Hot Chili SaucePPS : Bon Appetit magazine recently rated Huy Fong Sriracha Hot Chili Sauce as `` ingredient of the year ''	-1
This was my go-to hot sauce back in my High School days . But after years of using it , I 've come to realize that not only is it nothing special , but it 's actually just ... not good.For people who are looking for a miniscule kick , it 's decent . And it 's probably a good & # 34 ; access sauce & # 34 ; for people who are n't sure about their ability to handle spicy stuff . But honestly , even as someone with a fairly sensitive tongue , I find the burn completely unnoticeable . It essentially just tastes like vinegar . There 's nothing to it.I 'd recommend looking into other mild sauces . There are many others with a comparable burn that have a great deal more flavor . ( I 'd recommend Tropical Pepper Co. 's Papaya Curry sauce over this any day of the week , for example . It has a good flavor for its price and basically the same & # 34 ; burn & # 34 ; value as Frank 's RedHot . ) Like Tobasco , this is something that is popular because it 's a recognizable brand , despite being of a fairly cheap , low quality .	-1
This soup is my favorite Progresso soup , so my rating is for Amazon 's handling . Amazon is not properly packaging this product to arrive to the customer undamaged . Over half the cans were severely dented upon arrival , however I was lucky and did n't have one spring a leak like some others have mentioned in their reviews . Will buy locally in the future as the Amazon price is n't really that competitive anyway .	-1
Hey Progresso ! ! Is there a ham crisis ? ! ? ! I noticed that you guys were VERY chinzy on the ham in your split pea soup . The 'chunks ' were small and REALLY dried out - and lacking flavor.Whoever was / is the mastermind behind this new so-called recipe should be ashamed . Your OTHER stuff is great , but this 'split pea with ham ' is an embarrassment to your good name ... .Progresso - You 've spent DECADES building a solid reputation.Why blow it for a few lousy pieces of HAM - and a few idiots who clearly have no idea how to make YOUR SOUP ! !	-1
Completely artificial flavor where the 'lemon ' is concerned-the soup just does n't come together as a whole . I purchased because of diet and it was an affordable price , but wo n't again .	-1
I remembered liking this soup , and ordered a case . I do n't know if they changed the recipe , or if there was a problem with the order , but this is ... bleech ... gummy ... .bland . Fortunately the dog will eat it mixed with her dry food , so not a total waste .	-1
No matter what combination of water and microwaving I use , I can not make the noodles pleasant and soft like the stovetop version of Hamburger Helper.Quite honestly , this product is not turning out to be very palatable , which is a crying shame given that I bought it here in bulk.On the upside , as it is , it will do in a pinch , and it 's more satisfying and marginally healthier - but only marginally healthier - than , say , potato chips or other `` junk '' foods .	-1
We might not be a gourmet club , but we know when something looks and tastes like wall paper paste . ( And please do n't get us started on the strange smell ! ) I have used Hamburger Helper for years ( admittedly not that often ) but had never before used the Stroganoff variety . Well ... we will never , ever use it again . What a waste of perfectly good beef . And , FYI , I thoroughly followed the directions , and used fresh , lean hamburger purchased only an hour before . ( Honest ! ) Gross .	-1
I did not like the taste of this at all . The flavor was a bit spicy , and was not what I expected from Hamburger Helper .	-1
The local stores obviously think they 're saving shelf space by only stocking this 'enchilada box mix ' in the product line.Well , it DOES taste different than it 's chicken counterpart -- and this is not a good thing.If you 're looking for a fritoey-pie flavor , this would be the product to purchase . It could be prepared with ground turkey or veggie meat crumbles.But I ca n't recomend utilizing seafood because of the 'heavier ' flavor throughout the mix . I 've prepared it several times and I just have problems detecting the cheese taste which is supposed to be throughout . I got more of a 'chili ' taste . both upon my first and second bites.The product is edible . But it 's not one of the enjoyable dishes . And I did not end up feeling like I was eating a delicious dish which I 'd want to eat again -- or serve to others . Save your money .	-1
From what I remember , Hamburger Helper used to come with enough pasta for more than one person . I would have to buy four boxes to feed my three kids ! I can make this meal on my own for free . What a rip off .	-1
I expected more , to be honest . These taste EXACTLY like that cheap snack that comes in a box called Nutty Bars . I always hated those because they were so cheap tasting . Also , really ? Natural AND Artificial flavors ? It 's just chocolate and peanut butter , you really need to go artificial with such basic flavors ? Okay .	-1
The product itself was just fair.But the worst part of this order the condition that it came in . All six bags were terribly broken up . Each bag had very little chex pieces left in them because of poor shipping ! I purchased another item along with this one and who ever packaged this put a box in the middle of a shipping box and put the chex mix on the sides ( as if they were packaging cushions ) ! Who does Amazon have working in their shipping department ? Obviously not a lot of common sense . I will not buy this product again.. or any other `` fragile '' items !	-1
I like the idea of less salt , but , really , you need some to bring up the flavor . This mix is not worth spending calories on . I suppose if I was starving , I might make a dent in this bag , but since we first opened it a week ago , it is still sitting on the shelf.I do n't know how they decided to call this flavor mix & # 34 ; Bold & # 34 ; , because it is milder that a Ritz cracker or the plainest Dorrito . It 's got less flavor that an original Cheez-it.I did go through and pick out the dark & # 34 ; rye/pumpernickel & # 34 ; round chips ; there were ten or so . They did n't have much flavor to them ; I think they were just dyed dark brown ... The two different Chex in this mix are not bad , but the pretzels have no zing , no tangy taste when they first hit your tongue.If you empty this bag , if you are way too hungry to need this kind of a snack . Grab a carrot or piece of celery -- you will get the crunch you 're looking for and a perkier flavor .	-1
I was very disappointed in this bag of chex mix . I love caramel , way more than chocolate even , but this time caramel let me down . I did n't like how sweet my usually salty treat was , nor did I like the swirl cookies , I am not a fan of hard cookies unless they are Biscotti . It also was just three types of chex mix pieces and that did n't give me a bag of interseting . I would n't suggest them to someone who likes their chex mix salty .	-1
Love muddy buddies but amazon sent them all smushed . It looks like they had been thrown across the room . Skip ordering them online and a for sure recommend for purchase in the store .	-1
I would not recommend this product to anyone it tastes just like the cereal there is no garlic of parmesan fllavor to this product at all not worth the money .	-1
I do n't like this product . I love pasta salad and I 'm not picky at all , but this pasta salad is very bland and tastes like nothing except for oregano . I even used olive oil instead of vegetable like other people here said to do . I do n't know why this very bland product is getting rave reviews .	-1
REally wanted to like this but it has no taste . Now I am stuck with 4 canisters .	-1
Nestle makes some seriously lousy cocoa . If you can taste any cocoa or mint in this bland product , you do n't have a human tongue . The drink you 're supposed to enjoy smells exactly like bales of hay . And twenty seven clams ? Does it come with shares of stock in the company ?	-1
This particular food item left a lot to be desired . The powdered cheese left a very bad after taste . I will not be purchasing this item again . The only positive plug I shall give is that the serving size is generous .	-1
There was to much powdered cheese in each container . I tried to remove as much as I could but it still did n't taste good .	-1
I really was expecting something better from Betty Crocker . When I am hungry , I will eat about anything , but I 'm going to keep these around as a last resort .	-1
Pasta Alfredo ? Hardly . They should have called it `` Pasta Not So Alfredo '' .My only wish is that I could rate it -1 star.It came in a pack of 12 . I 've got 11 that I do n't want.After following directions to the letter , I ate about half , and threw the rest out.It made my stomach feel as if I had swallowed a stone.In the past , I have learned that you should n't expect super great taste out ofsuch types of products , however , very few have been THIS horrible . It wasabsolutely disgusting.I hate wasting food , even if it is this bad . I 've decided I 'm going to donate theother 11 packages to the local food pantry . Maybe someone else will enjoy this ?	-1
Meh , not that great . Comes out too thick and gloppy . More of a chemical than cheesy taste . Not really recommended .	-1
Sorry , Knorr ! I usually am a HUGE fan of your products ... .Not so here ! There is something that just tastes very fake in these noodles -- and it truly tastes like there is something missing , too ... VERY strange flavor . Absolutely WILL NOT be purchasing this products again . NO WAY ! Some of the other items in this line are fantastic , but this one is a zip in our books .	-1
If you like bland and pointless , you will love this product . It is not that it is bad , but I do not know what I could have been thinking when I ordered it . You can , I guess , spice this up to give it more flavor , or add vegetables and meat to make a different product . But frankly , why bother ? You can make your own dish better with fresh rice , spices , beans and meat and vegetables if you want them .	-1
I absolutely do not get why anyone would make red beans and rice from this package instead of from scratch . It is just as easy to make your own . Read the ingredients list on this -- what is some of that stuff ? The home made version tastes so much better . You just take a cup of long grain rice , add two and a quarter cups of water , a quarter teaspoon of salt , 1 tablespoon of cayenne pepper , stir until combined , bring all this to a boil over medium heat stirring once then turn heat down to low and simmer for 20 minutes.While it is simmering , cut up a polish kielbasa sausage and heat it in a pan with a couple of tablespoons of sizzling hot saved bacon grease or olive oil or peanut oil or whatever you like . When the rice is done simmering , add the sausage and two cans of well rinsed kidney beans . Stir it all and cover the lid over it for a couple minutes to let it rest .	-1
I 've been eating Knorr ( Lipton ) noodles for about 15 years now . They are simple to make , inexpensive , and tasty . This particular variety is rather lacking in the flavor department . As far as all the Knorr varieties go , this is near the bottom of my list . I will probably not be buying this one again . This flavor , along with the other two new flavors ( Bacon Cheddar and Scampi ) are rather disappointing . I would have expected more from Knorr . The discontinued Beef Lo Mein Asian side from Knorr was much , much better than this .	-1
Please note that the picture displayed with this product no longer reflects the current recipe . As other reviewers have noted , the packs now contain vermicelli mixed in with the rice . What an unpleasant surprise when I cooked some last night . The flavor is the same , but the texture is now unpalatable . The vermicelli is slippery and gelatinous , just an awful combination . I wrote to the manufacturer in the hopes that they are getting lots of similar feedback .	-1
I LOVE rice dishes including many of this brands ( Knorr ) offerings.I love the taco rice and the teriyaki rice dishes are my favorites.I like Brocolli cheese soup and I thought & # 34 ; THIS IS GOING TO BE GREAT ! & # 34 ; BOY WAS I WRONG . this was extremely bland . Not much flavor at all . This lookedAnd tasted like plain rice and vermicelli with tiny little bits of broccoli in it.There was no taste of cheese nor the color of cheddar of cheese about it.If you like broccoli cheddar keep looking because THIS IS N'T IT !	-1
Lets get this straight-most of Knorr 's sides are awesome and an inexpensive way to make a meal , but the flavor for the mushroom rice isnt here- its just too bland , I dont taste the mushroom flavor at all . How I solved this was by addingreal mushrooms or onions or beef stock , but you shouldnt have to add anything to this to make it good , This is a flavor I wont be buying again .	-1
I am a big fan of Knorr broth and sauce mixes and use them frequently not only because of their great flavors , but also their lower sodium content . So I decided to give the Mushroom Rice Sides and the Asian Chicken Fried Rice Sides a try . What a huge disappointment ! Not only are they sticky and gummy texture-wise , they are virtually tasteless . Could not detect any mushroom flavor at all . Tried both the stove top and microwave directions , and got the same poor results . Then tried adding broth mix , various herbs , onions , etc. , all to no avail . The remaining nine packages of each of these are packed up for delivery to the local Food Bank .	-1
I ordered this because the title and description both say & # 34 ; pack of 20 & # 34 ; which I thought was a good deal , but what I received was a pack of 10 , which is of course not such a great deal.Please update the product title and description to accurately describe what you 're selling.The product itself is excellent , so I will update my review if this misinformation is corrected .	-1
saltyness may be the `` norm '' for products like this , but it doesnt mean i have to like it . its probably healthier than a `` slim-jim '' , but i still wont order again because it contains lots of milligrams of unhealthy salt , and it tastes extremely salty . better have a gallon of water nearby to go with it , if you want to try eating these.i hope they can try making a lower sodium version of this some day..	-1
I ordered these on May 21 and they turned out old with a bad aftertaste , however I order another batch around mid June and they taste totally fresh and great.I would really appreciate a refund on the order that tasted old and had an aftertaste , or be offered a fresh batch of the product , such would dictate good customer service.Update : I 've contacted Amazon on the specific order of this item that tasted old and had an aftertaste , I 've been reimbursed for that specific order right away . That 's the Amazon customer service I 've grown used to , excellent , and will keep me returning as a loyal customer.Thank you Amazon .	-1
As someone who has been a fan of Ostrim products for the past five years , I have probably eaten 300-400 of these high protein snacks without incident . Unfortunately , this was not the case with my purchase in February of 2011 . In an attempt to shave costs off of my high protein diet that can over 1,000 dollars per month for one person , I decided to purchase 60 Ostrim sticks ( 3 x 20 ) in regular , barbecue and teriyaki flavors . Since the expiration dates of these are generally a year into the future , I assumed that I could store the sticks for several weeks . I was dead wrong.After about four weeks of storing the sticks at room temperature , several of the shrink-wrapped air-tight sticks started inflating like balloons . This is a sign CO2 and methane being generated during decomposition . The inflated sticks were discarded and the few remaining that were still in their normal shrink-wrapped state were placed in a refrigerator.About a week later , I ate three refrigerated sticks just before heading to a venue for which I purchased tickets . This enabled me to get an exact timeline of the events , which are chronicled below . Suffice it to say , about four hours after eating three of the refrigerated sticks , I became deathly ill . I am 99 % certain the Ostrim sticks were the source of the food poisoning due to the highly controlled , high protein diet at the time where every food , calorie , and gram of protein was being monitored.The symptoms were so severe , I thought about going to the hospital . My girlfriend at the time was a physician who was able to provide some assurance that the issue was not life threatening . It took about three days to recover , which meant three days of zero productivity . In the end , a regular Ostrim consumer became someone who cringes at the very sight of the Ostrim display at my health club.Timeline of Ostrim Food PoisoningEvent ... ... ... .Date ... ... ... .TimeOrder from Amazon ... ... ... .2/11/2011Package Arrived ... ... ... .2/16/2011Discard of inflated ( decomposed ) ... ... ... .

Really High in salt ( 3,250 mg/box ) and a third of the calories are from FAT . The package states that it contains less than 0.5 % of MSG , etc ... .again with the neurotoxins ! ! ! The flavor is not really cheesy as you 'd expect from the hype on the box . The potatoes do remain firm though . It 's hard to describe the flavor . Creamy yet artificial tasting . No , I really must NOT be sucked into buying these awful scalloped potatoes again . Buy it at your own risk .	-1
These were too much work and too much time for what I was looking for . I would not order them again .	-1
I threw away every pack , and I hate to waste money . This product is disgusting , seriously . I am not a huge fan of powdered mashed potatoes anyway , but this yuck in a bag take the cake . EWW !	-1
I should have stayed with Idahoan brand . Poor Betty is on her last legs , rolling downhill into oblivion ! I 've used several brands of potato flakes and found them very good . But not Betty 's brand . The finished product tastes stale . Bland , unpleasant , not worth continuing eating -- -but the worst part is STALE . I am totally ashamed of Amazon for offrering these packets . My advice to any customer looking for good mashed potato flakes : Move on to Idahoan or another brand and leave poor Betty by the wayside.Where these packets should have been left . Alone . Ignored . Skipped over . By the way , I did n't like them !	-1
I was lazy , ordered these . No better then store brand dried mashed potatoes . Will never buy them again , unless I become a full & # 34 ; prepper & # 34 ; .	-1
I do n't know what to do , one box down , 11 to go and they are awful . Maybe if I jazz it up with something really funky like salt , or cheese maybe ? No wonder they were so cheap .	-1
I realize these are instant potatoes , but in my humble opinion they pale in comparison to other instants like Idahoan . They 're extremely bland ( I even tried adding butter & milk ) and the texture is pasty . About the only positives are that they 're cheap & quick !	-1
I 'm glad I bought one box of the Mashed Sweet Potatoes before buying a 12 pack of it from Amazon . My daughter made the mashed sweet potatoes following the box directions . The sweet potatoes looked just like the picture on the box . Looks can be deceiving though : the Betty Crocker Mashed Sweet Potatoes had a funky texture and a bad after taste . I ate my serving and told my daughter she did an excellent job preparing the potatoes as I did n't want to hurt her feelings . In truth , this is a very poor product and not up to Betty Crocker 's normally high standards of prepared food mixes.Two star rating based on ease of preparation.Do not recommend.Penmouse	-1
I tried making this product using two of the methods prescribed on the box , i.e . baking and microwaving . Each time the results were tasteless and horrible . One more comment : I am no gourmet so a product has to be very bad for me to take the remains , as I shall do here , and dump them where the resident heavily maternal resident opossum can access them .	-1
Betty Crocker Homestyle Reds , 100 % Real Mashed Potatoes , 3.3-Ounce Packages . these taste off even with milk and butter added . I like the ones in the box more they taste like real potatoes . these stink big time	-1
I am sorry I bought a dozen . The product tastes good the first time but then it becomes boring the second time . And by the third preparation the smell all over the house becomes objectional . I was hoping we would eat a box a week , but the onion taste and smell is so strong it stinks up our whole house for the day when we prepare the item.I bought on a subscription order basis but cancelled because of the overly strong seasoning.I also bought the Skillet Fries and am really sorry I did . They have the same seasoning and just as strong . I fixed half a box and after re-hydrating tried to rinse off a lot of the season but it did n't work.It will take a year or more for us to get rid of these . Probably give some to the postal workers homeless food collection at Thanksgiving.I wrote the company regarding reducing the seasoning but have had no response as yet .	-1
I bought this for my daughter who complain that it was really grainy and gritty . I wo n't be buying it again . It is n't available at the local health food store .	-1
Did not buy this tea from Amazon , but did purchase at local Target store . Though I love anise and licorice flavors , and found the tea quite tasty I had the issue crop up of bleeding gums . The day I bought it I had 16oz over the course of 6+ hours . At bedtime I brushed my teeth only to experience bleeding gums and canker sores . The following morning I had not decided that the tea was the culprit and had another 8oz . After that cup was partially gone I decided that the tea was to blame and discontinued using the tea . Within 48 hours my gums stopped bleeding when I brushed and the canker sores cleared up . Went for my regular cleaning nearly 2 weeks later and they could still how inflamed my guns were and evidence of the canker sores.I contacted the company and was told that the batch I bought was fine by their standards , discontinue use , and follow up with my doctor . My dentist looked over the tea ingredient list and told me to toss it because it could have been any of the ingredients . I had the dentist toss it . I will never buy this tea again , and am leery of trying their other teas . Just beware of possible side effects like this .	-1
Recently , I 've been searching for a good ginger tea . Preferably , something that captures the awesome spiciness and flavor of ginger . Well , I picked up this tea in a store because it clearly listed ginger as one of the top ingredients and you can even smell the spiciness in the tea bag . However , once you brew it ( and I let it steep a long time ) you ca n't even taste any of the ginger . What happened to all the spiciness ? I do n't know , but it does n't make a good ginger tea . Furthermore , it does n't even taste good otherwise , as it is really bland in flavor.I suppose that there are still some health benefits to drinking this tea , and it would be really good for someone who wants the benefits of ginger but can not stand its taste . Personally , though , I was really let down by this tea , hence the 2-star rating.I discovered that you can make tea by directly boiling some slices of fresh ginger root . This produces a much more satisfying ginger taste and spiciness , and is a whole lot cheaper . So , if you are searching for spicy ginger tea , just use a fresh root and skip expensive dried teas all together .	-1
I got a box for just over a buck on sale to try . I do n't have problems going but there are days where I barely do and it 's hard so I decided to try this on one of those days . I drank before bed just like the box said , let it sit in boiling water for 15 minutes . Not even an hour after drinking the cramps started . I spent the next hour , maybe longer on the toilet . It was not fun and I was exhausted , I just wanted to sleep . Finally after going more than I ever have in my whole life . I was able to go to bed . Thankfully I did not wake up due to cramping . The next day I felt okay , then I was out shopping and lo and behold the cramps started again . I ended up going back home just to be safe . I went , and went and went throughout the afternoon , wondering when I would ever stop . I did n't stop going until in the evening.So , the reason for the two stars is the cramps . They were bad . Maybe not as bad as some I have had before . The instructions are not exactly honest , especially how I drank the tea and not even an hour later was going . So clearly it is different for everyone , I will only drink this again if I am so constipated I have n't gone in days , that probably wo n't happen , but it 's there , just in case . The product clearly works but the cramps just are n't worth it too me . Next time I will probably try brewing for only 5 minutes to see if this lessens the side effects . The fact that it cleans you out , is 5 stars .	-1
I 'm not sure if I like it , the taste is a little weird to me . I think I 'll stick with magnesium .	-1
Years ago I wrote a review singing the praises of Smooth Move , which I 'd drunk for years . But two different doctors told me it probably was n't a good idea to drink it . One reason is that it stains your colon . So when you have a colonoscopy , it 's more difficult for the doctor to see what 's going on in there . Also , it 's a stimulant laxative , which can cause problems with regular use . I now take Miralax , which works perfectly , and the doctor says I can take as much of that as I want .	-1
I bought the 6 pack and followed the direction . The tea tastes great but it did n't increase my breast milk . I did n't have any luck with this product !	-1
There 's a lot of talk about echinacea being a lot of hooey when it comes to helping cure or reduce a cold and it 's probably true , except this tea contains a lot of organic kombucha , spearmint leaf , lemongrass as well as green tea -- in addition to echinacea , with a nice tangerine tang to it , so you really feel you 're getting relief for your cold with this tea . You do n't have to rely upon the mythical effects of echinacea to receive benefits from this tea and enjoy it.And it is enjoyable to sip and it 's sumptuous when raw unfiltered honey is added to it.It smells and tastes good and it warms the throat like a good brandy . I really do feel that it supports the immune system.The only problem I have with this tea is the Yogi tea company that provides the product . It thinks extortion is somehow proper , so it colludes with the kosher mafia to put a damn & # 34 ; U & # 34 ; with a circle around it as a symbol on the box , an icon the cost for which is passed off onto the unsuspecting consumer in order to support an organization of rabbis who also do not provide a health service to the individual consumer . That 's really a raw deal for us . This costly symbol conveys no help benefits and simply comprises an involuntary kosher tax.Non-Jewish Americans need no rabbi 's ratings . This company needs to find a better way . Maybe put a & # 34 ; W & # 34 ; for White people or a & # 34 ; C & # 34 ; for Christians . And an & # 34 ; M & # 34 ; for Muslims . And get other races and other religions to pay for the symbol . Until then , only a boycott will fix the problem.Check out double you double you double you dot checkthelabel dot com dot uk	-1
I drink all types of teas , but this is one of the worst tasting teas , in my opinion .	-1
I was looking for a strong ginger tea and purchased the Yogi brand based on its reputation . I am certain Yogi offers many delicious teas ; however , I just do n't like the taste of this one . It tastes of licorice and just feels murky in my mouth . I have a hard time getting it down and ca n't taste the ginger unless I let the bag sit in the cup for a long period of time . The spicy kick of ginger I sought was totally lacking . Unfortunately , I purchased two boxes at a time . It 's going to take a while to get it all down , but I guess I will eventually do so.-Update : 5/17/13 - Generally I drink my teas unsweetened , which resulted in my atrocious experiences with this particular tea . Since I had such a good quantity in supply and could n't bear to throw it all away , I made a cup today sweetened with Splenda . That made a mountain of difference . I still wo n't say it is my favorite tea , but the sweetness took the disgusting edge off what I found initially unpalatable and nauseating . Although it was my intent to steer clear of artificial sweeteners , it 's what 's available at work . Now , I can give the tea an extra star !	-1
I know what Ginger tastes like and this is NOT Ginger . The only things I found pleasant about this tea is that it came in a beautiful box and the individual packs were nicely packaged , I do n't care whether this is organic or not , the flavor of Ginger is absolutely absent . If you appreciate the aroma and strong flavor of good cup of Ginger tea then try `` Prince of Peace '' Honey Ginger Crystals . The aroma lights up the room , the flavor is strong and authentic and since they are crystals , there are no tea bags to deal with and the result is a good clean cup of genuine Ginger tea .	-1
The older I get the more painful my periods are with severe cramping and bloating . I love drinking tea when I 'm at work so I thought I 'd give this a try and I have n't noticed a change in my cramping/bloating . The taste is n't & # 34 ; bad & # 34 ; but it 's not & # 34 ; good & # 34 ; either . Basically , what I mean is it 's not bad-tasting but I 'd only drink it if it worked well . Some people said they started taking it days before their period and it helped so maybe that 's what you need to do . I only drank it during my period . Everyday of it ; and I did n't notice a difference .	-1
This stuff works to get rid of bloating but the taste is horrible . It is very bitter so I would use stevia or honey to help with the taste .	-1
I 've tried many ginger teas and this one is by far the best tasting . I add a little agave to sweeten it and it 's just perfect . Not too weak , not too strong.UPDATE AS OF FEB. 1 , 2014 : THIS TEA HAS CHANGED AND IS NOW ONE OF THE MOST TERRIBLE TEAS I 'VE EVER TASTED.I have been drinking this tea almost everyday for many months now , but today I got my second bad order of it . So , it will have to be sent back , or thrown away , or whatever . But it is now TERRIBLE . TERRIBLE ! ! ! ! ! I was so loyal to this brand and this flavor but I can not drink it anymore . The smell is different , the taste is absolutely awful . I 'm going to e-mail the company but in the meantime , if you drink this tea , stop . It has changed and the change IS NOT for the better . BOOO .	-1
Did not do a thing to relax and just needed to get up in the night . It was not a great taste either .	-1
I bought 5 different varieties of Yogi tea and find that this blend is the most tolerable of the Yogi teas I have had so far . I do n't care for the stevia at all , there is a taste that really turns me off and I believe it is the stevia but ... they use so many ingredients in their teas that it is hard to pinpoint the actual villian . We use stevia at home but it seems that stevia in processed products takes on a weirder flavour - to me anyways . I do not find that this tea relaxes me either but something in it feels like a stimulant . I will go back to my valerian , stinky but simple , clean and relaxing .	-1
Taste like cough syrup ! It 's kind of sugary but has a very plastic and unnatural taste , and a slightly bittersweet after-taste.Wait , no , it 's not exactly sweet . It 's just slightly bitter . And leaves a very , very strange , chemical-like , unnatural sensation on your tongue ... Yup , taste like cough syrup !	-1
This is the polar opposite of Sleepytime tea . I had one cup last night , and I laid in bed and did n't fall asleep till well after midnight , and then kept waking up every few minutes after that . Worst sleep I have gotten in my entire life ! I 'm going back to Sleepytime tea . At least that stuff works .	-1
I have been a yogi tea lover for years and have purchased countless boxes here on Amazon . While I was looking intosome new blends I came across a few reviews that made me angry at myself because I stopped closely monitoring their labels because I had developed a trust for this brand.This is what I found when I started digging # 1 almost none of the ingredients are Organic like they used to be # 2 The company had a hostile takeover in 2010 where the widow of the of the founder was defrauded by forged documentsresulting in several lawsuits . ( source wikipedia ) # 3 They are now using so called natural flavors . If you watch Dr. Oz you will know there is nothing natural about what they can doto your body , they pose many health concerns and there are now scientific studies to show this. # 4 Gross out alert ! those with religious & ethical food concerns such as Kosher , Halal , & Vegetarians should know alongwith the rest of us that beaver anal ( yes a beaver BUTT ) secretions are used as Vanilla , Strawberry and Raspberry naturalflavoring called Castoreum . Source FDA	-1
I guess it 's a matter of tastebuds but unless this healed me for good I would n't drink another sip if I was paid to drink it . Okay - there might be a price that would make me drink it everyday but only one cup and the price is pretty high : - ) I 've tried several yogi teas and this one as well as the others are just absolutely horrible . If I do n't like something or I have an allergic reaction ( which I frequently have from foods or preservatives ) I usually pass it on to my mother or sister so the money is n't wasted but this , I threw away , every last package . Another good reason for Amazon to sell food in smaller quantities . YUCK !	-1
First I have to say that I love Yogi tea . I love the messages on the tea bags and some flavors are remarkable ! This one , however , is horrible . I guess if you love licorice root you will like it , but I do not . I tolerate the licorice flavor in the CALM Yogi tea because it really calms me before bed and makes me feel like I am floating on a cloud , but it still manages to taste good whereas this one does not.Please do buy Yogi tea and get the Green Tea Slim Life instead- terrific taste , which tastes like green tea with berries in it- a good flavor and not an artificial flavor to it . This Fasting tea has a bitter after taste , which is all licorice root . Stay clear of this flavor but do buy Yogi Tea . I feel transformed by the messages on the tea bags , as it is ; so profound ! Wise quotes from Yogi Tea by Yogi Bhajan '' The universe is the stage on which you dance , guided by your heart . `` `` The purpose of life is to enjoy every moment . `` `` Delight the world with compassion , kindness and grace . `` `` Laugh because that is your purpose in life . `` Happiness is every human beings birthright .

After reading that some people have issues with Kombucha tea , I Googled it and read some more . I recommend that others do the same before drinking it . I am sure that Yogi Tea produces their Kombucha in a careful environment , but it can cause health problems . It also does not appear to be appropriate for people with Candida despite some claims . It contains alcohol , sugars , fungi , yeast and molds , and a study showed that it did not improve symptoms of people with Candida . I 've been drinking it almost daily and have been having unexplained stomach aches lately and will try eliminating this tea to see if it helps , now that I know more . Again , read up on Kombucha and make your own informed decision .	-1
Green tea . Kombuch is supposedly good for you but this product tastes worse than dirty socks water . I was not impressed , but at least I tried . Then I got a recipe and got the stuff and mde it from scratch , and it was a little sweet but drinkable .	-1
This tea has too many different things in it . When I look for a green tea , I want just green tea and not several different other herbs . The taste on this is n't bad , but I got much better results as far as energy and lifted mood with another green tea that I was using that was 100 % nothing added.This particular tea also has burdock root in it . This herb can be strong , so you can only take a few tea bags of this a day to keep from getting sick . Taking too many herbs a day will make you nauseous , as I felt taking this tea several times a day . It 's too strong.I would 've been happier if this was just green tea and maybe the lemongrass that they added , and that 's it.In order to reap the full benefits of green tea , you have to drink several cups throughout the day .

Brewed and tasted a wide range of mass produced green teas , including Yogi.Large scale production for mass consumption results in a very low-grade tea quality , and a low price.Mass production results in a depletion of the natural nutrients.This enables low prices , while the benefits are very limited , or absent.The enormous varieties of low-grade teas are typically grown at lower altitudes where the plants are pruned to create the maximum yield , via larger leaves . The processing is rapid to lower cost , and to establish large scale distribution.Quality is compromised.Cultivation , processing , and packaging of green teas to preserve the rich antioxidant profiles created by nature , is an exquisite art form.An excellent rendition of this exquisite art form is realized in the high-quality , Matcha and Sencha tea offerings from Kyoto , Japan , by Maison Tea Ikkoku.Green teas , by Maison Tea Ikkoku reflect a celestial combination of excellent quality , flavor , and vibrant well-being.Enjoy .	-1
I love yogi tea , pretty much every flavor I have tried . This tea tastes good but I have had no detox effects with this one . I 've used the berry detox and that one really works well so I 'm not sure why this tea is not the same . If you dont care about the detox part , the flavor is very pleasant and mild .	-1
If you are expecting the 'peach ' flavor , you will be very disappointed . I 'm a huge tea fan , especially , Yogi brand , and this is awful . I wish I would have order one box and not the pack of 6 ! ! Bummer	-1
A couple years ago I drank this every day . It was rich with cardomom flavor . When I recently reordered I found that like everything else in this sorry world , the quality of the tea had deteriorated drastically . It is bland and flat compared with the spicey richness of flavor in the past . I wrote to complain ; they replied they used the same `` recipe . '' It 's the ingredients and the process that count -- not the recipe ! I may have to make it myself.January 2014.I bought a couple of boxes in hopes they had raised their standards . No such luck . Crummy crummy crummy . I wonder how these people can live with themselves , knowing they 're selling inferior products .	-1
I ordered this Yogi green tea after trying 3 of their Chai teas . This green tea has no taste at all to me . The tea is organic , but no taste . I will continue to buy Japanese Sencha - as I prefer the vegetal or grassy green teas . I can give this away to other people , so it is not going to waste , but I would never buy this tea again .	-1
I drank this tea and within an hour needed to go to an after hours urgent care center ! I have had numerous herbal teas in my life , and really I get to this one and have an allergic reaction ? Definately not happy now that I ordered the six pack and only went through one cup and a sip of another cup before I started to have issues..	-1
I have consumed two boxes of this and my milk supply has dramatically decreased ! I am trying to isolate any other potential variables and will try to stick with it ( since I have 4 boxes left ! ) but I am disappointed . Also , this has Anise in it so it you like black licorice you should enjoy the taste . I however strongly dislike black licorice and have a very difficult time drinking it . If my supply increases later I will come back and change this review otherwise this has been a waste of money and a bad tasting experiment . ***Update , my review stayed . I will be throwing the last couple of boxes away . Not work my time or money . Too bad .	-1
Did not like the taste or the texture and my husband would not eat them after one try . Will not be buying again !	-1
I waited a long time to write this review I did not get one mushroom from this patch . I will never waste my money again !	-1
My log developed mold spots on it ( due to excess humidity ? ) . I wrote to the seller to ask for advice and to see if I could salvage it ( at the email address that came with the log ) and never heard back . I ended up tossing out the whole thing . A waste of money . : - ( The log did grow a large amount of mushrooms ( though , again , inedible because contaminated by mold . )	-1
I love sugar and chocolate , but these bars are too sweet . I bought them based on the reviews , but I gave them away since they are too sugary . They could get away with using a third less sugar and still be sweet . I was looking forward to a healthy bar , but these are n't the ones for me . Bummer .	-1
I do n't have to lose weight . However , I am fighting chronic candidiasis and I have to stay away from sugar , all refined carbs and dairy products . When I found these chocolate bars , ( which taste great to me ! ) I wrongly believed I had finally found the chocolates that would n't feed my Candida . I was wrong because Maltitol does feed Candida . I found out that XYLITOL is the **only** sweetener that does not feed the yeast . Fortunately , I managed to find delicious dark chocolate bars sweetened with Xylitol on the Internet and I am going to stick to those . Being that Xylitol is so healthy , why is n't it used on more products ? Unfortunately , many of us already know the answer . : (	-1
Too pricey will not go here again . I am health conscious , but now a daysbudget conscious takes precedent . Thanks , but no thanks .	-1
I was so disappointed that these crackers came crumbled . It would have been nice to get an entire cookie . The taste is okay but a bit bland . But I took one of the packets and ate all the crumbs . I do appreciate that they are separately packaged however in pecies . Why can not they pack them so they dont fall apart . Going to send them back .	-1
The tea I received was old , old , old , the flavor was gone , and none of it had any taste to it . The tins are very cute , but unless you 're into collecting cute little tins , I would skip this one .	-1
I love tea and wanted to give loose leaf a try . However , loose leaf tea can be pretty expensive and I 'm picky with tea . Not a connoisseur at all , just flat out picky . This pack seemed perfect ! It was cheap and I would be able to have a variety of teas . I received black tins that included : Lung Ching ( dragon well green ) Pu-erhJasmineLychee BlackTikuanyin ( oolong variety ) OolongSo far I 've only tried the Tikuanyin but it 's decent . Again , as I 'm new to loose leaf I might not be the best judge but I find the flavor pleasing . There are stems in all of the tins and some of them are quite big . To their credit the tins are filled to the brim with tea . In the end I think you really get what you pay for . The tea is nice enough but not as high brow as typical loose leaf teas . **Update**Taken down to two stars . The more tea I try the less I like it . I 'm probably going to end up throwing all of these out . You 're better off buying bagged tea ; it 's a higher quality ! Lychee had a highly metallic taste to it . Took two sips and threw the rest out.Lung Ching was bland and had a dull flavor . Not at all bright and clean as tea normally is . Seemed maybe it was old and stored poorly.Pu-erh was alright , nothing special . ( I 'm new to Pu-erh tea so I may not be the best judge on this one . I enjoy Foojay Dim Sum Pu-erh quite a bit . This was like a toned down version ) .I found the more of this I drank the more stems I was picking out . Seemed to be almost half stems .	-1
In reading the reviews it seems some people have received okay tins and some of us have received smelly , moldy , stale , horrible tasting tea . I usually read all the negative reviews and I did this time but ordered it any way hoping I 'd be one of the lucky ones . Besides I do n't know a whole lot about how Chinese teas are supposed to smell or taste . I smelled every can and some were okay but most had a strange smell that I would call musty . I figured the proof was in the tasting . I made a cup of oolong tea , the one Chinese tea with which I am a little familiar and had to throw it out . It tasted worse than it smelled . The tins are cute and I almost kept the tea so I could have the tins , but common sense says there is no use keeping something when it smells so strange .	-1
ALTHOUGH I RECEIVED MY SHIPMENT IN A TIMELY MANNER , I WAS VERY DISAPPOINTED WITH THE PRODUCT . IT TASTES LIKE INSTANT NON-FAT DRY MILK AND NOTHING LIKE SOUR CREAM . IT MAY BE OK TO USE IN COOKING , BUT NOT ON BAKED POTATOES . ALSO , IT DOES NOT COME WITH DIRECTIONS . IF I COULD , I WOULD GIVE IT MINUS 5 STARS , THAT 'S HOW DISAPPOINTED I AM . THE COMPANY MAY BE GOOD AND THEIR OTHER PRODUCTS MAY BE GOOD , BUT NOT THE SOUR CREAM POWDER .	-1
I searched for a yogurt starter on Amazon and this product came up as an option.When I received it there was a sticker `` not to be used as starter '' .Amazon did agree to take back the unopened bag . I do n't know what to do with the remainderof the open one .	-1
Dehydration directions say that you need guar gum . I just added the required water in order to mix it in with a recipe and it came out like water . The guar gum is a thickener , like cornstarch . Flavor wise , I think it tastes like sheep or goat milk ... I 'm not sure but I do n't like it .	-1
We use all kinds of low sodium products and prefer them , but there just is n't much flavor to this soup . The consistency is good , though .	-1
This formula seems to me to be a cheap substitute for the previous one . I ca n't use this for recipes-it 's runny , goes half as far ( you ca n't dilute it ) , has cream as ingredient ( do n't want ) , no taste at all , scarcely tell it has mushroom bits in it . I 'm not sure what the idea is behind this , unless it is cost-saving ; I am really unhappy about the switch !	-1
Ever get that feeling your purchasing something that need , but that when you get the package , you know you got screwed ? Well , that 's how I felt when the shipment arrived . The case was damaged and it looked as if we had bought a damaged case for full price . Not a good feeling .	-1
always been a huge campbells soup fan . have been eating it for years.. sorry but this is the worse soup i have ever tasted.i could not even finish one can.. i tried different things to enhance the flavor , but nothing helped . its just unreal.. surelycampbells did not sample this soup before they put it out for sale.if i could i would give it less than 1 star..lola..	-1
When I read the positve reviews on this product , I ordered it . It is definitely low sodium and if you have a medical condition that requires very low sodium , this soup would fit the bill . If you are just trying to cut back on salt , again this soup will work fine . I personally feel that most of our food has way too much salt and sugar in it so I thought I would give this product a try . I like the convenience of it being ready to serve but I must admit , it has very little flavor . It 's almost like drinking water with a slight mushroom taste . Truthfully , I miss the salt . I think that soup , generally , needs salt but as I stated , most are much too salty , however , this soup is just too bland . When I added a little bit of salt , that made a big difference . Also , I noticed that the soup is very watery and thin . I like my mushroom soup a little more substantial . I do think this soup would work very well in casserole recipes . I probably will not purhase the low sodium variety of Campbell 's Mushroom Soup but I do like many of their other products . However , and this is important , if it is an absolute necessity that you cut back on salt for health reason , then this soup would be perfect for you . Some non-salt seasoning could make it more flavorful . I give Campbell 's credit for trying to make their products more health conscious . More companies should do the same . Salt and sugar must and should be reduced -- a little can go a long way .	-1
But I swear it 's `` soup on the go '' not broth in a cup . The broth is EXTREMELY bland . I had to put hot sauce in it ro actually be able to take the taste . I got the chicken noodle one and it sucks . I eventually got used to the taste , but there was n't any chicken inside . Nasty slimy carrots , which was n't mentioned on the can , ew . And all the noodles sank to the bottom , and are basically impossible to get out after the broth is gone.Good thing I only bought two , I actually might buy again just because it was easy and quick . Just add your own seasoning and its basically edible . That 'll be my `` in a rush '' and I dont care what I eat type soup . Other than that , I 'll stick to their bowls . They actually have chicken inside their chicken noodle soup .	-1
I dont think it matters which soup at hand you purchase cuz they dont stand UPRIGHT long enough to heat the soup , had it flip over , spilling contents out of course . I will NOT purchase again .	-1
As a consumer , it is my right to know what ingredients are in the products I buy . I find it very DECEPTIVE that Campbells products do NOT LIST upfront WHAT THE INGREDIENTS ARE IN EACH OF THEIR PRODUCTS . So , you have to go online elsewhere and lo and behold ; SUGAR IS IN THE FIRST INGREDIENTS ! ! ! ! ! ! ! Consumers beware that sugar is the NUMBER ONE ADDITIVE used by Campbells and it is the NUMBER ONE ADDICTIVE substance that people suffer from . Read labels . Campbells ought to know better to be upfront -- - and stop loading up the consumers with sugar instead of REAL TOMATO , pure vegetable ingredients . And , in case anyone wants to be informed , there are many DECEPTIVE LABELS MANUFACTURERS USE TO call sugar AND THEY ARE ALL THE SAME CHEMICALLY ; SUCH AS DEXTROSE , MALTODEXTRIN , SUCROSE , SUCRALOSE , CORN SYRUP , ORGANIC sugar ( I love this one , so it is made without fertilizers , -- -- NOTHING IS HEALTHY ABOUT SUGAR )	-1
For the price , these things are overpriced I think . Sure they are healthy and look cool , but that comes at a price . The soup is actually decent , and I like sipping the broth after I eat soup so this was why I tried this . Only takes about 1 minute in the microwave and your good to go . The only downfall to these cups is that even though I mixed it up good after microwaving , the noodles stay on the bottom once you are done sipping it . But if I can save these cups and put regular soup in for the future , I guess that would be cool . But I do n't think you can dishwasher these cups . 2 stars for the taste and nothing else . 3 stars less because of price , noodles , and size .	-1
No meat in it . I ordered a case for quick lunch and barely anything but broth . I have always been a loyal Campbell 's Soup fan , but this was very disappointing . When I say there was very little meat , it is not an exaggeration that there has been an average of a half-pencil eraser size piece of meat in each can -- if that .	-1
& # 34 ; Big chunks of Potato 's & # 34 ; and clams -listed in the advert here for this alleged Campbells & # 34 ; New England Clam Chowder & # 34 ; - well , this IS N'T what it says it is -- it 's so far from a chowder it 's laughable . I felt sorry for the one tiny 1/4th inch ( if that ) sized potato & # 34 ; chunk & # 34 ; and the one shred of 1/16th inch of clam I found in the entire 10.75 ounce container nobly trying to uphold the reputation of the Campbells one time decently chunky with both potato 's and clams actual Campbells New England Clam Chowder as it was in regular cans -not as it is in these tall microwavable foam covered containers with the very hard to remove red plastic tops . There is n't anything IN this chowder-except soup and the one tiny lone contingent of the 1/4 inch or smaller sized Embassy of the past Glories of once chunky potato 's and clams that used to be in it but are n't now - not in these containers of it anyway -- .Too bad really -- as a clam and potato flavored soup -if billed as such and NOT as the chowder it is n't -it is n't bad , but as a chowder or trying to carry the once famed Campbells Chowder Reputation ? ? - BIG FAIL .	-1
Pack of 8 Campell soup listed for $ 51.00 regular ? Lol ... .What grocery store sells them for that price ? They must be kidding right ? Now on sale for what ? You can buy them in any store for a little over 1.00 each ! On sale even less ... ... .Bogus Prices-Bogus-Prices ... This grocery site is not for me ...	-1
This combo of acidic tomato soup and cheesy parmesan has the distinct aftertaste of vomit . I really , really ca n't get past it . I just wanted to warn everyone . I love the regular creamy tomato version , though .	-1
I have had these before and liked them , but the case I got tastes really metallic . I have only had two from the case but both had this weird metallic taste .	-1
This does n't taste like any cream of broccoli soup I 've ever had ... not even the regular canned , condensed version from Campbell 's . Very disappointing . I gave it to my local soup kitchen along with some other canned goods . I would n't have been able to eat it myself .	-1
I do n't know what they do but if you open a can of tomato soup it taste very different from this stuff . They added something not good to this . The price is much higher than in the super market . I will not be buying this stuff .	-1
These are larege tea bags , with about twice as much in them as in Alvita or Seelect fennel tea bags . When I brewed up a cup according to the instructions , it was just too strong for my taste . Maybe you like your tea strong or need it that way for your condition . After trying it several times , I concluded it was just too much for me and went back to other brands . They leave me feeling much better than this does . For those who would need or enjoy it , I 'm sure it would be very good .	-1
I place my order on Janaury 23 for the noodles . Due to overwhelming demand the supplier ran out and I had to wait for restocking . Once the item was restocked , 2/9 , I was sent an E-mail with a link to UPS . After a few days , 2/13 , the status of my package went from `` receiving billing information '' to `` exception '' . The package was damaged in transit and has yet to be replaced , it 's now 2/23 . Seller is so-so about responding to communication ( they usually respond it 's just they are not quick about it ) and until I actually receive the product , I am very hesitant to use this seller again .	-1
I really tried to like this product , but could n't stomach it . I did rinse the noodles a lot , as recommended , but they just smelled faintly of bad fish to me . -And I like fish ! - I was really excited to try this product because I have heard a lot of good things about it and was very eager to find a low cal alternative to traditional noodles , but this just was n't for me .	-1
When I first cut open the bag and have this miracle shiritaki noodle washed the smell of it was very mild like salmon after that I boiled it for a good 3 minutes then run it down with cold water then I put it on a flat plate to patted dry with a paper towel once it is dry I cook it with some recipes I got on YouTube the flavor of the sauce and other stuff I cook with was good however chewing on the noodles was like biting down on a rubber band and it was difficult for me to even swallow the noodles down soon after that I threw it back up after that I threw it all the noodles away even I though I wasted my money on this noodle it is not worth trying I do n't recommend it !	-1
Shaped like Mushroom Caps and similar consistency ... ... .Loma Linda Tender Bits , 19-Ounce Cans ( Pack of 12 ) ... .I paid $ 70.45 for 12 of these I also bought several of the other products from this brand ... .They are Heavy ALL were shipped in On large box ... SEVERAL cans have HUGE dents in them ...	-1
after reading al the reviews , i tried this product and do not like the consistency . I found that if i cook it in the microwave for a few minutes before using in recipes it is slightly more palatable . this is not my favorite chicken substitute - prefer the fri chik over this product .	-1
I opened my box and found that one of the box of crackers had been open and removed . The crackers came in the wrong size , and some were cracked . I was raging mad ! but the quiet kind of mad that leaves one feeling homicidal . i want a new box of crackers or my money back which ever comes first . So disappointed , so very disappointed . ONE GREAT BIG FAT STAR !	-1
These sugar free thingies just must start using Stevia or Splenda , , , else the taste , like this one , is barely tolerable , even for just 2 cookies . Maybe that is for the best , but simple oatmeal cookies , made with real sugar in human portions , is just more healthy . o , and tastes superb !	-1
everything in the nutrition label under carbohydrates is sugar . dietary fiber is sugar but digests very slow so can be ignored mostly . sugar alcohols are better for those who need to avoid sugar , but over 70 % of the carbs in these cookies are neither fiber nor sugar alcohol . if you want truly sugar free , your best bet is finding cookie recipes that use almond flour .	-1
I used to eat this stuff 10 , 20 years ago , ca n't remember . I do remember it being awesome , and totally delicious , and hard to stop eating , which is why I stopped buying it . I bought a box recently , now that I 'm better at portion control , and found , much to my great sadness , that it tastes totally different . The texture is also different ; before it was crunchy and broke apart right away , whereas now it sort of sticks together more and is a lot less crunchy . I found it so much less good that I 'm not even eating it , and am trying to slough it off onto my husband , who is less picky about food in general .	-1
Someone must have shaken the boxes violently while packing or shipping . 1/2 or more of the crackers are broken , which works out great if you like crumbled crackers in your soup or chili . For those of us who do n't , it is irritating to find only 1/2 the box usable .	-1
There is no smoke or burger taste at all in this . This was a big let down . There is an overwhelming bean taste . Reminds me of Hot dog chili without the chili powder . The texture is the same as chili . Not solid enough to cut and fry . I tried . So the only use for this is chili or no meat sauce.If you want a burger or burger sub , then do not buy.Should call it redi ground .	-1
I was only able to use one of a dozen cans - they had to be disposed of as they were rusted , dented and dirty . After disinfencting the only undamaged can , i found this product to be delicious , it is a shame i wo n't attempt to reorder . This is the 3rd Loma Linda product that has arrived in such horrible , unsanitary and unusable condition ..	-1
my daughter liked them but they were broken and some crushed.and a little stale.but my daughter was satisfied.thank you very much.the last just to get enough words .	-1
I usually love these cheese and peanut butter crackers , but these are probably the worst I 've ever had . The peanut butter was stale tasting and the crackers greasy and mushy . I do n't know if these were just old ( I could n't find a date on the package . ) or if the Keebler product just is n't as good as other brands , but I 'll never buy these again . I 'll stick to the Lance or Austin brands for future purchases .	-1
I TAKE CHANCES WITH THINGS I SHOULD N'T . END RESULT , I END UP GIVING THEM AWAY . EVERYONE ELSE LIKED THEM . JUST NOT ME	-1
These are tasteless and No Ginger . Will not buy again . Do not recommend ! Try grandma 's old fashion instead . I do n't care for them at all .	-1
Some kind soul here on amazon had recommended I try again to find old fashioned ginger snaps and I believed the 9 5-star reviews that these would fill the bill . Dumb of me ! I confess I should have gone to store to find a bag and try them . But I got the pack of 12 . Now I have food to contribute to the local Food Pantry . There is NO flavor to these cookies . They arrived very quickly as I live in Illinois where they are made . They are fresh , have the crunch , have the appearance of old fashioned ginger snaps , but there is no flavor at all . Believe me , please , if you are looking for the decided taste of ginger and molasses you can avoid these . Baking your own seems the only alternative since they are clearly not making old fashioned ginger snaps on a commercial scale anymore . I give up !	-1
I did n't like this beef jerky much , especially the texture . I do like the more natural ingredients , however .	-1
I 'm a huge fan of jerky and if not for the high sodium content in it ( among other things ) , I 'd probably eat this every day . I was n't expecting a miracle from this jerky , just something good enough that could help tide me over as far as jerky went.Here 's the thing , though : it 's just not that good of a jerky . It 's a very soft jerky and the meat felt like it 'd been processed a little too much before it 'd been dried because it had that mushy texture to it . This in itself is n't enough to put me off entirely , though . It 's not an unforgivable obstacle.What got me was the taste . There 's definitely a pepper taste here , but it 's pretty bland overall and it 's not really all that satisfying of a jerky experience . I remember eagerly ripping into that first bag and kind of giving a `` eh , it 's not great but it 's not awful either '' shrug . I gave some to my mother to try , who ended up saying the same thing.If you 're looking for a low sodium jerky , this is probably one of the lowest sodium pre-packaged jerky products out there , but it 's just not all that great . I 'll finish what I bought , but this just was n't something I 'd consider buying again . I 've discovered that Jack Links has a low sodium beef jerky , which is actually not that bad . I 'd absolutely recommend that over this .	-1
It does have a banana taste but then it has an undertone of something strange it smells like I am eating Caranuba car wax . I did not like it . I will try a natural banana flavor .	-1
this tastes NOTHING like hazelnuts . anyone who thinks so is just being deceived by the label . god only knows what is really in here .	-1
I love this product for how natural and whole it is . I think the salt has a wonderful mild flavor and I know my body is benefiting from all the minerals that are in it.However , I have one MAJOR issue with this product and that is the fact that it contains a lot of hard crystals , some send , etc . These crystals do not dissolve and if you bite on it , it will sound crunchy and even painful.Unfortunately , I 've tried this product on 4 different occasions to make sure it was n't just a bad batch , and they all had crystals that do n't dissolve.I 'm sad to report that I chipped two of my teeth over a period of 2 months . The chips are microscopic , but I do have quite a bit of sensitivity in those teeth . Also , if your teeth are naturally prone to sensitivity , I would presume this product would irritate them even more.Great idea , but the filtration process leaves little bit too much of inpurities behind .	-1
I agree with `` scootser '' , this drink is far too sweet and I have a gigantic sweet tooth so if it 's too sweet for me then it is too sweet for a lot of people.41g of total carbohydrates ! ! ! ! ! 170 calories for a 8.4 oz can ! ! ! ! ! ! I should have known that the meyer lemon juice was going to be too sweet when I read the nutritional facts , but there were so many great reviews I decided to give it a try anyway . Bad decision ! Drinking this juice is like drinking a liquid lemon drop with a bitter aftertaste . If that sounds terrible to you ( and believe me it is ) then do n't buy this juice .	-1
IZZE Fortified Sparkling Juice , Blackberry , 8.4-Ounce Cans ( Pack of 24 ) Nice flavor but I found it so sweet it 's undrinkable . I have been drinking Izzy carbonated juice drinks and find that level of sweetness just about right . Each of the tiny cans of Essn Meyer Lemon juice has the equivalent of about 11 teaspoons of sugar in it and about 170 calories . Being that the cans are only 8.4 ounces that 's quite a lot . If you want something refreshing , avoid this . But if you like syrupy sweet drinks you 'll like this . The lemon flavor is nice but they should cut the sugar in half if not by 2/3 .	-1
I purchased these BIG FRANKS after reading the positive reviews and after enjoying other LOMA LINDA products . I have NO idea what the 5-star reviewers ate because I could barely stomach these pseudo-food products . I 'm not sure what to do with the remaining cans because relish , catsup , onions , mustard and tons of other toppings failed to camouflage the rubbery off-taste of these `` franks . '' My conclusion is that I think I 'll eat all the condiments and dispense with this red-grey monstrosity.UPDATE : After reading responses to my review , I realize that the way to appreciate these franks is to eat them during childhood WHEN YOU DO N'T KNOW ANY BETTER ( sorry ... just kidding ... I could n't resist ) . Okay ... If you do n't acquire a taste for these during your imprintable years , be cautious about buying them now . You 've been warned . GOOD LUCK .	-1
These are my least favorite of the Loma Linda products . Unfortunately , the texture is a bit like modeling clay and the taste is unappealing to me .	-1
Product is fine . $ 11 for one small can is absurd for 4 small burgers . It should be priced around $ 3 . I wo n't buy again . Even the cases for this product on Amazon are way too expensive but it 's better than the single can price .	-1
i guess that i was expecting something `` chunkier '' it tastes like salty mush to me - i started adding it to big pots of chili to try to use it up	-1
Honestly have n't tried them yet ... .but my aunt pointed out that their ingredients looks quite dangerous and resemble those in other foods high in GMO's.Ingredients : Water , Wheat Gluten , Red Beans , Tomato Paste ( Tomatoes , Salt ) , Soybean Oil . Contains 2 % or less of Salt , Modified Corn Starch , Onion ( Dried ) , Hydrolyzed Soy Protein , Corn Protein , and Wheat Gluten , Sugar , Monosodium Glutamate , Caramel Color , Autolyzed Yeast Extract , Garlic Powder , Corn Syrup , Dextrose , Spices , Natural Flavors From Non-meat Sources , Vitamins and Minerals ( Niacinamide , Iron [ Ferrous Sulfate ] , Vitamin B1 [ Thiamin Mononitrate ] , Vitamin B6 [ Pyridoxine Hydrochloride ] , Vitamin B2 [ Riboflavin ] , Vitamin B12 [ Cyanocobalamin ] ) , Paprika , Extract , Corn Oil .	-1
I tried really hard to like the product ( it comes in a case of 12 after all ) but I just could not take the taste . It looks like regular chili , has some fat like regular chili , has a texture like regular chili , and it almost tastes good , if you can get past the salt.This is the second , and last , of this brand and type of veggie product I will try . They rely too much on salt to compensate for the perceived lack of flavor from real meat . A much better , IMHO , veggie chili can be made with some diced onions , tomatoes , green bell peppers , a hot chile of your choice , garlic , oregano , chili powder , a little masa , tomato paste , and one or more types of beans , like pintos , kidneys , mayo coba , etc . Just a pinch of salt and your done , or add your own meat or substitute if you have to.I hope there are some vegetarians at the food bank.Edit : I 'll add that many canned foods tend to be a little salty to me , so we do n't eat too many of them . I will say that compared to other canned chilis I have tried , vegetarian or not , this compared favorably . But , I ca n't take salt out of a prepared food whereas others can always add salt . This was the deal breaker for me , as it is with other prepared , canned chilis .	-1
After reading the reviews on this site , I purchased a whole case of Saucettes off of Amazon.com . I was a little dissapointed . I was expecting them to taste just like the frozen Morning star Farms links . But , the flavor was MUCH milder than them , and I was dissapointed . They have the same flavor , but are not as spicy nor as flavorful . I tried breaking them up and using them as taco meat and they were n't so bad that way . If I could do things over again , I would have bought a can at a health food store and tried them out first . I would reccomend that others do the same since some people really like them .	-1
I guess I expected more of a breakfast sausage taste . these are very like the hotdogs ( which I like very much ) . So , if I am buying `` dogs '' , I will just buy `` dogs '' in the future . I do like the other products just fine . It 's great to have veg options for a quick meal !	-1
these undersized and overpriced packets of miso soup has additives like 'dry fish powder ' and i did not notice the small print of ingrediants before buying and accepting shipment . i have other products ordered through amazon that are great and repeatedly shipped to my door but this product is inferior and i wish i could get a refund on unused and still sealed portion .	-1
This soup would be more rightly called FISH SOUP , rather than miso soup . It has miso listed as one of the ingredients , but the BONITO fish overpowers everything else . Although I like fish , I really hate this soup and I feel cheated by the money I spent on it .	-1
I agree with the last reviewer , the ingredients list on amazon should be more clear . I thought this was a vegetarian soup when I ordered it , now after receiving the package I am disappointed to discover that `` powdered bonito '' is powdered fish . It clearly states that Bonito is fish on the package , but on amazon it does n't specify this . So this purchase ended up being nothing more than 10 bucks down the drain for me . ( I have a shellfish allergy that developed a few years ago . I have had to be very careful about all seafood as I have had reactions to some fish paste and soups made with fish sauce at restaurants . Fish & shellfish are not the same as far as allergies , so I do not know why this sometimes happens . It could have been cross-contamination or maybe I am allergic to certain fish as well ... .In any case , I make it a point to avoid things like `` powdered fish '' in my food . )	-1

Recently , I have been trying to upgrade my eating habits and reduce any processed food and additives from my diet . That said , I have been very careful to read labels and small print . With Miso soupls in particular , I have noticed that unless the packaging does not say 'No MSG '' in big bold letters on the front of the package , the soup contains MSG . This brand is no exception . I like the taste and was enjoying it for quite a few years until I have made this discovery . No MSG Miso soups exist but are harder to find . I usually go to specialized Asian markets to get them . This brand is the most commercially available Miso soup on the market . It 's a shame that it is not the healthiest choice for those who care about what they eat .	-1
I thought formula might be handy on the go , but the baby hates this stuff . She 's fine with breast milk , cow milk , and some other formulas . She 'll prett much eat anthing , food-wise . Surprised by her disgust after drinking a sip , I gave it a sniff and a taste myself . It 's dreadful , really metallic tasting . Not sure if soy formula 's always like this , but I have to admit I was pretty surprised it tasted like anything by sugar after reading the ingredients.2 stars instead of 1 because it does mix up really easily.If your baby has taken formula from the get-go , they may be more tolerant . We have encountered other really tinny ones from the endless stream of Enfamil samples , so I do n't think it 's altogether rare .	-1
Enfamil Prosobee Soy Infant ( ages 0-12 months ) is characterized by corn syrup , oils , soy , DHA , choline , vitamins , and minerals.The sugar in milk is non-sweet lactose ( disaccharide ) , which is not absorbed into the bloodstream already in the mouth , as sweet glucose ( monosaccharide ) , which thus is not a healthy substitute for lactose . Unfortunately , milk 's lactose is substituted for corn ( glucose ) syrup solids in Mead Johnson Nutrition formulas except Enfamil Newborn , Infant A.R. , Infant Milk-Based Stage 1 , and partially EnfaCare , but not for non-sweet maltodextrin ( polysaccharide ) . Corn syrup ( solids ) contains glucose and - like high fructose corn syrup - may contain fructose , which presence ( sweetness ) can be masked by adding other sugars . Scientists say high fructose corn syrup is addictive as cocaine . So are corn syrup solids with fructose , which content is not provided on the label . Also , high intake of dietary fructose may lead to liver damage from bacteria due to their movement from gut into the blood stream and liver.So , would you like to start your child 's obesity and exposure to a potential liver disease ( NAFLD ) when he/she is an infant , wait for later , or maybe not to accustom the child to corn syrup at all in order to avoid the fructose desire/addiction , as concentrated fructose is not common in nature , humans were not exposed to its consumption , and thus are vulnerable even those who are not obese yet ? ! DHA ( docosahexaenoic acid ) found in fish oil is an omega-3 fatty acid that can be synthesized in humans . A study found that preterm infants fed DHA had better developmental outcomes , but not the full-term infants or term infants ( 1-12 mo ) who develop normally . A formula for the newborn ( 0-3 mo ) without corn syrup seems to suit better both the preterm and full-term newborns while no evidence suggests that supplementing DHA for the older infants ( 3-12 mo ) is beneficial.Choline is found in sunflower , soy , cod fish , broccoli , cauliflower , milk , chicken , etc . Endurance athletes and people who drink a lot of alcohol may be at risk for choline deficiency and may benefit from choline supplements.For the record , Mead Johnson ( & Co ) Nutrition has 3 lines of formulas : Enfamil Newborn ( ages up to 3 months ) , Enfamil Infant ( up to 12 months ) , and Enfagrow Toddler Transitions ( 9 to 18 months ) and Enfagrow Toddler Next Step Milk Drinks ( 1 year & up ) . Enfamil Newborn is characterized by easy to digest proteins , choline , DHA , and vitamin D. Enfamil Infant is characterized by choline and DHA . Enfagrow Toddler Transitions is characterized by DHA , choline , calcium , vitamin D , and antioxidants . Enfagrow Toddler Next Step is characterized by calcium and vitamin D , and is available in two flavors : vanilla and natural milk .	-1
Since this was for a child , since the child did n't like it ... it kind of goes without saying that I did n't like it , either . Rather than taking to this formula , the reaction was more of a & # 34 ; get this away from me as soon as possible , & # 34 ; so we wo n't be buying it anymore . Which is kind of a good thing , as I was hesitant to even try this , as soy is quite the versatile food - but with a large array of negative & # 34 ; side effects , & # 34 ; regardless of how it 's prepared.All in all , I would n't recommend this ... nor would the child that would n't drink it .	-1
Avoid all non-Organic soy products like the plague . roundup ready soy also is sprayed directly with roundup which is in the ground up soy flour as well . This combination does not bode well for the health of anyone who ingests it and has been shown by numerous third party studies to cause terrible health issues.Bottom Line this stuff is unfit for human consumption ! ( check out gmoevidence dot com ) ALWAYS do your own research when feeding your children , I leave you with a quotation from Dr. Swanson , a scientist studying the effects of Glyphosate ( Roundup ) : '' The endocrine disrupting properties of glyphosate can lead to reproductive problems : infertility , miscarriage , birth defects , and sexual development . Fetuses , infants and children are especially susceptible because they are continually experiencing growth and hormonal changes . For optimal growth and development , it is crucial that their hormonal system is functioning properly.The endocrine disrupting properties also lead to neurological disorders ( learning disabilities ( LD ) , attention deficit hyperactive disorder ( ADHD ) , autism , dementia , Alzheimer 's , schizophrenia and bipolar disorder ) . Those most susceptible are children and the elderly . ''	-1
This formula came just at the time my baby had developed a bad gas habit . However after trying this for a few days I gave up . The first attempts seemed to reduce gas , however she actively disliked the taste ( this is soy based versus regular milk based formulas ) .But I should note that I have not tried other soy based brands . so I 'm giving this two stars instead of one .	-1
To me this is not worth the price . A full cup with one pod is water downed and pretty tasteless . Yes , people have commented that one pod should only really make the half cup . But the dark and med . roast for me makes a full cup . I do n't like things that strong . Paying as much as you are I expect to have a full cup from one pod . You can take a normal med . roast pod , make a half cup and fill the rest with your own skim milk , sugar and vanilla creamer and it tastes better . This is less pods then the dark or med . roast for the same price . So basically you are paying for bad coffee with some skim milk and sweetener .	-1
I have a coffee pod machine that uses Senseo type pods so I thought these would fit . They did not , they have a plastic piece that made them not fit in my machine even with the two pod holder . I gave them to a friend who does have a Senseo machine and she loved them so if you have a machine that can use them , great but if you have one that is not Senseo , they may not fit .	-1
These taste like instant coffee with skim milk . I much prefer Senseo Dark Roast , with half and half , stirred while it is making . It makes an excellent cappuccino or latte . These pods taste artificial and puny .	-1
I ORDERED THESE CANDIES AND OF COURSE I WAS EXCITED BECAUSE I LOVE GINGER CANDIES ... .BUT I FOUND THEM AT LEAST FIVE ( 6 ) SIX LOCAL STORES FOR WAY LESS THAT I PAID FOR THEM ON THIS SITE ... I WILL CERTAINLY DO MY PRICE-CHECK , LOCALLY FOR CERTAIN ITEMS BEFORE I PURCHASE THEM ONLINE ... ..	-1
straight off , these teabags smelled & # 34 ; different & # 34 ; than the stash and twinings we were used to in our house . I made this for both my mother and daughter , both life-long tea drinkers , and neither of them liked it . my daughter thought it was so bad she poured it out after one small sip , while my mother managed to get down less than half a cup . this is not the red , robust tea I was expecting , but instead was a muddy brown , so , it 's back to stash for us .	-1
Their Golden is golden but not a fan of this version . Just too burnt bitter a taste for me . If your buds leans toward the grilled flavors then you might like this however .	-1
Twinings teabag Irish Breakfast Tea has four tea leaf rating while the English Breakfast Tea has three tea leaf strength rating , illustrated on the box . The images of Twinings tea tins do not possess the strength rating , however , when I received my tins they both had three tea leaf strengths on the front of the tin . I can not explain the disparity in strength rating between teabag and tin for the Irish Breakfast tea.My reason for buying Irish Breakfast tea was for my first cup of tea , higher strength than their English Breakfast tea . Amazon should correct this by getting Twinings to send updated images . Similarly , written descriptions fail to indicate Twinings tea strengths using Twinings tea leaf rating system . This should also be corrected . My supplier 's and Amazon 's processing were both superlative .	-1
I was so disappointed in these . I LOVED the flavor of candy cigarettes as a boy . I had n't had them in years so I decided to spring for a case of them . Would n't ya know it ... they not only changed the flavor noticeably , but even the texture has changed . They used to melt in your mouth and have a & # 34 ; cool & # 34 ; taste to them . Not any more . They are lumpy hard things . They do n't even paint the tip red anymore , not that it matters , but still ! Boo-hiss ! ! !	-1
I 'm with Michelle ... Due to all the hype though , I recently bought Kerrygold butter and I 'm not impressed in the least , nor is anyone in my family . I think a lot of people are convinced ; if it cost more , and comes from Europe , it has to be better . I say GREAT advertising Kerrygold ! Personally I do n't care for the taste . I 'll use it up in my baking , but will never buy it again . In spite of the use by date being 11/2014 ( it is now 4/2014 ) the butter tastes old to me . And how can butter last that long anyway , and still be good ? If it were Land O Lakes I 'd think it WAS old and toss it.And before all you Kerrygold defenders out there pounce on me ; you have a right to your opinion and I have a right to my opinion ... at 71 I know what butter used to taste like on the farm , and I 'm just as pleased with Land O Lakes .	-1
very tasty , but very small cookies , only 2 for a serving and the box can be purchased in a grocery for 1/2 the price literary . So go to publix and save 3.50 plus the shipping if you chose to go for the 2 small cookie thing . I rather do a large brownie .	-1
I hate it when I ca n't give an organic food a strong rating . I depend a lot on the reviews of others here on Amazon , and consider them a very helpful tool . These crackers are not `` flaky '' or even crisp , they are just down right hard . As others have stated , there are a high percentage of broken crackrs in every box . As someone who has to curb my use of salt , because I like it too much , I agree with other reviewers who found them too salty . I have tried 3 other organic crackers here on Amazon . We like Suzie 's organic saltines a lot , but they have the highest breakage record . Late July 's Round Saltines are n't too bad , but our favorite so far has been `` Back To Nature 's Saltines '' ..	-1
These crackers taste great and we like that they are organic . However , the texture is too soft to make it through shipping . We buy and enjoy other Late July products at the local branch of a popular grocery store that features lots of imports and organics , such as their cheese flavored and whole grain crackers . Perhaps if that store carried this type they 'd be okay to purchase from there , but when we opened the case of these that arrived on our doorstep from Amazon , about half the crackers in each box had been reduced to fine crumbs during shipping .	-1
I have to start out by saying I don & # 8217 ; t drink energy drinks & # 8211 ; ever . When Red Bull first came out , I tasted it because it was all the rage , but didn & # 8217 ; t like it . Later I found it was palatable with vodka . Lately at work about 3 pm I seem to hit a wall , I thought I would try this drink and see if it would help me over that hump.Turns out I couldn & # 8217 ; t stomach it . It tastes awful . It tastes like the medicine I have to force feed my son when he is sick . It & # 8217 ; s really not good . I took a couple more sips and could not finish the can.Then there is the obscene amount of sugar and calories - 25g of sugar , 25g of carbs and 100 calories . It & # 8217 ; s a teeny tiny can of empty calories , to me . In comparing it to my co-workers & # 8220 ; monster & # 8221 ; that was twice the size and had zero sugar , 2g carbs and 0 calories per serving . In a pinch I think I & # 8217 ; d choose that , organic or not . It tastes better and organic or not seems like a better choice for a once in a while pick me up.There was nothing about guru that would make me buy it again . Good old coffee will just have to suffice ! Cherise Everhard , May 2014	-1
This is by far the worst tasting canned drink ( energy or just regular soft drink ) of any sort that I have ever had . The taste can only be described as like cherry cough medicine with all of the medicinal taste pushed to the front . I took a big swig to start with and was shocked at how bad it was . I followed up with another tentative taste to confirm it really was so horrible and then I asked my wife to try it and see what the flavor was . She took a small taste , grimaced and said , & # 34 ; Robitussin. & # 34 ; On the positive side , I drank it on Easter morning so I would stay awake during the sunrise service and then drive for an hour to go to a family get-together and it did keep me awake .	-1
This energy drink has a horrible taste , and an even badder aftertaste.It did n't seem to give me much energy either.Not recommended .	-1
Yeah this is n't a real good energy drink at all.A bit sour and it leaves you with an aftertaste that you ca n't quite figure out.Too much sugar besides.Trying to give away the rest of my 24-pack but no takers as of yet .	-1
Anything that uses natural ingredients is fine in my book , so I was happy to give GURU Natural Energy Drink a try . It includes certified organic ingredients like can syrup , white grape juice , green tea leaf extract , guarana seed extract , achinacea flower extract , and panax ginseng root extract . That 's excellent , but most energy drinks include these same ingredients ( although not necessarily in their certified organic versions ) .What I expected was a decent little jolt of energy that was similar to the sustained energy of Five Hour Energy or the sudden punch of energy that comes with countless other energy drinks like Monster or Red Bull.What I got , however , was not much of anything except for one hundred empty calories and another can to go into the recycling bin . I was n't impressed at all.The slight energy that I did receive was mild and not sustained for a very long time . I get much more out of a sugar-free , zero calorie Monster drink.The flavor was okay in my book . I could definitely taste the grape juice , and the overall flavor was a lot less medicinal than other similar drinks.Overall , I would n't recommend GURU Natural Energy , unless you 're a really , really dedicated organic type of person . Also , this stuff is gluten free as well .	-1
I consume energy drinks on a daily basis . For a few years , I drank Rockstar . For the past 2 years I have been making my own with Sodastream - I buy the diet energy because it is no calories and no sugar , but plenty of caffeine . I usually drink a full 1liter bottle first thing in the morning and I must admit I add more syrup than you 're supposed to . I use about 1.5 caps of syrup instead of 1 cap . This does n't make me race around , but just gives me the nudge I need to get on with my day . Sometimes i 'll make another half liter later on in the day.This was my first time trying or even hearing of GURU , and unfortunately , I found them to be extremely ineffective . I have drank 6 of them in the past 11 hours ( ! ! ) and I took a 2 hour nap during those 11 hrs . I felt no energy at all from them . My last one of the 6 was about a half hour ago . I feel nothing , except a slight stomach ache most likely due to all of the sugar.The taste is n't bad . It has a typical energy drink taste . It has a little less carbonation than a coca cola would . I like a lot of carbonation and that is something else that I am spoiled with , with my sodastream . I can put as much carbonation as I want.I do n't mind drinking them as a regular drink , but I wo n't be going to them specifically for energy . It definitely was not worth all of those calories and all of the sugar.The product info here on the page is a bit misleading . In one place it says 97mg of caffeine per 8.4oz serving , another place says 100mg , but on the can it says 125mg.My sodastream claims 80mg caffeine per 8oz serving . Maybe the & # 34 ; natural & # 34 ; caffeine in GURU is not as potent ? The sodastream syrup also has some vitamin content - 20 % daily value of Vitamins B6 and B12 , Niacin , Folate , Riboflavin , and Biotin , as well as 50 % daily value of Vitamin C. It may not mean much , but I like having that vitamin content , as I am a picky/poor eater and I need to consume them wherever I can.The can says not to mix with alcohol and I am wondering why.I would n't recommend these to someone who drinks energy drinks regularly and has a tolerance for caffeine because they are ineffective .	-1
Do n't know why , but this tea makes my belly ache . I still have all 5 boxes unopened . Maybe will give it to someone . It was n't smart of me to order the whole 6-pack before trying it out first	-1
I love blueberries , green tea and Yogi Teas but I do not like this ! It has an orange spice taste up front like the only flavored tea around when I was a kid , did n't like it then , do n't like it now . Then it finishes with a Stevia after taste ! Yuck . I like my teas plain and would prefer to add my own sweetener if I feel it 's needed . This is a miss in my book and it 's not surprising when the ingredients list 'natural orange flavor ' before 'natural blueberry flavor ' in the line up . Why not something more natural like actual blueberry ? Right ? Silly me . It does n't taste like a berry of any kind by my standards . So , if berry and green tea are the taste you 're looking for AND you like the multifaceted herbal taste of Yogi brand teas then try their Goji Berry instead , it 's wonderful w/ no weird sweetener after taste and no orange spice ! Goji Berry is 5 stars in my book !	-1
I love all kinds of teas , I drink some every day . I saw that so many people like this blueberry variety , so I decided to try it . I am a big believer in the `` groupthink '' of customer reviews . And I am rarely disappointed in anything Amazon . I did n't see that stevia is an ingredient . Stevia creates a very bitter taste in my mouth . So I will be sharing this shipment with my friends who do n't mind stevia . I 'm going to look at other Yogi teas and check on the ingredients closely .	-1
Taste ok , but doesnt not work if you want to use it for slimming . However dont mind the taste , just for the sake of drinking healthy tea .	-1
Mint is not pleasant to have in winter time at all , just realize there is no winter in India where the Ayuvendic fomulla was made for . So a good formula for people live in India does n't mean it work for people live in other part of the world .	-1
It has an impressive list of ingredients ( licorice root , fennel seed , wild cherry bark , cinnamon bark , orange peel , slippery elm bark , cardamom seed , ginger root , mullein leaf , clove bud , black pepper ) , but I could not get past the taste . To me , it tasted like warm black licorice . I used only 1 bag for 24 oz water and by the time I got about 8 oz of it down , my belly started to bubble so I poured the rest out for fear I would see it again and I threw the rest of the box in the can.It is a 100 % natural herbal tea , just not for me . It is also USDA certified organic.If you like the taste of warm black licorice , it may be useful to you . I will go back to my chamomile tea for soothing the throat .	-1
I expected more cocoa but its rather like more a spice tea ... but not as delicious as chai.. if you want spicy just go for chai . definitely this is not cocoa tea at all . i do not see a point to buy this tea again..	-1
I do n't like this tea compared to other Yogi teas . The taste is a miss-mash of flavors ; kind of likedrinking something that was made of a bunch of leftover teas . Wo n't buy it again . I like theirChai Black much better , although it does have caffeine , whereas this one only has 5 mg per teabag I think .	-1
This stuff tastes like mushrooms to me and I hate mushrooms ( partially allergic ) . I assume it 's the soy based product coming out in it since it 's vegan and does n't use any other source of protein . I gave it an extra star ( bumped up from 1 star ) since it does provide protein and that 's essentially what I wanted . I ended up returning it since it tastes horrible .	-1
These chips used to be fantastic , light , crispy , good crunch and satisfying . The & # 34 ; new and improved & # 34 ; crisps are flat , hard , very brown/burnt like cardboard or heavy paper , no taste , I am so unhappy I purchased a whole case of these crappy chips . DO NOT BUY THESE , they are awful , I wish I could give negative stars .	-1
Drastic change to this product from what is pictured . I was a huge fan of the Genisoy Soy Crisps Deep Sea Salted ... the old formula , but if you order these now they will arrive to you marked as `` New look and improved taste '' ... . Not sure who determined that the taste is improved , but in my opinion these are awful.The old crisps were nice and puffy , very light tasting and a great salt flavor . The new crisps looks like they kept them in the oven for an hour too long . They are paper thin now , very crunchy , burnt colored , burnt tasting , and I think they left the salt off . And when you open a bag do n't be surprised to find mostly broken pieces inside instead of whole crisps . I 've opened two bags so far and 50 % of them are broken into tiny pieces . They are so thin and fragile now.Just beware before you buy a case of these that they have changed very much . I 'd suggest finding a bag in a grocery store first and trying them out before investing in an entire case of a very changed product.A big thumbs down to Genisoy on this one !	-1
I just purchased a box of these to only discover that the 'new improved ' formula is awful.The crisps are not puffed at all and are completely flat and hard , not at all like how they use to be or what is pictured on the bag . They are like chewing on flat rocks to be honest with you.I wrote the company asking if these was a bad batch or something to only get a response that this is the new formula and `` We think the new product has an improved mouth feel and overall pleasing crunch experience which we believe will ultimately provide for a better snacking experience . `` .Plain and simple , I am NOT going to be buying these again . Look elsewhere ( Glenny ) for soy chips/crisps .	-1
This product says that it contains Kava Kava to help with it 's calm tea , but there is no Kava in it . This is confirmed by the tea box set as well as Yogi Tea website . I just thought I would make anyone else aware in case they were looking for a little supplemental Kava for their tea , but do n't want the other Yogi tea with Kava in it .	-1
Kombucha is traditionally a combination of bacteria and yeast that is theoretically supposed to help balance the flora in your intestinal tract . While Yogi teas tea box does not make these claims , they also fail to tell buyers that their Kombucha tea contains both bacteria and yeast . They claim that the strains of bacteria and yeast are safe , however they stated to me that their product contains Brewer 's yeast which is known to aggravate even cause yeast infections in those prone to systemic yeast infections . They claim that the yeast is killed in the Brewing process , but one can not be sure of this and if you are prone to systemic yeast infections , I would highly recommend that you avoid this product . They have already had one law suit filed against them by a woman who is convinced that their product caused her yeast infection .	-1
This `` newer '' Yogi product is very different from their old mix and is a big disappointment . ( To me ) . It 's hard to describe the flavor in what I got , but there is a distinct taste of something like the odor of fresh , moist dirt . I do n't know if they got some tea from a different source , or what . The ingredients of both are identical . But this one is definitely unpleasant . I make sun tea with it almost exclusively . Their old style came in a maroon bag with a yellow square on it , and said `` Yogi Tea '' instead of just `` Yogi '' . And , silly me , I bought a bunch of this thinking I would get exactly what I like and was used to . So , I 'm sending this shipment back and going with the licorice and the ginger . So do n't buy a large quantity like I did until it meets your expectations . My bad !	-1
I have a bout of gastritis and learned that coconut water is the natural way to help relieve those issues while fasting . I tried it and it worked great but I tried two different brands , Zico and Vita Coco . I loved Vita Coco and hated Zico - the more I drank it the more I hated it ... will not buy again !	-1
Ok I agree that coconut water can be an acquired taste . However if one chills the coconut water and adds FRESH I repeat FRESH lime juice to it the taste is fantastic.I consider this essential to natural hydration without chemicals , colors etc.Update : O.N.E . is definitely better tasting , we switched .	-1
This is the product that rocked my world ... In a bad way . After buying this I realized that some companies ( and people ) will do anything for a profit - like rip off their fellow man . Here 's how ... .Zico used to be real 100 % coconut water . Now , after conglomerate Coca Cola bought them , it 's dumbed down : it 's now part coconut water ( juice ) watered down with H2O ( water ) with unspecified `` natural flavor '' added so you are tricked into thinking your coconut water has n't just been seriously diluted . Why ? It 's cheaper ! They save money by cutting it with plain water . But it would n't taste the same , right ? That 's where the flavoring comes in ... . To trick you.Zico wont actually specify how much they water it down but you can guesstimate simply by their ads ... . They brag this product has 30 % less sugar than other brands . Ok , that means this is likely a 70 % coconut to 30 % water mixture . Do you want 100 % coconut water or 70 % coconut water in your bottle ? This is n't the ratio nature intended by the way . And if that means 30 % less sugar ( ie 30 % less actual coconut water in the bottle ) it also means 30 % less electrolytes than you should be getting from a 100 % product too . It 's just logic .	-1
This is the most artificial tasting coconut water that I ever had . And its not that cheap & # 8230 ; .I doubt a coconut was ever part of the equation when making this water .	-1
I was expecting this to taste as good as some of the other coconut waters and what an unpleasant surprise ! ! ! ! I can not even finish one bottle UGH !	-1
I recently purchased one of these from my local supermarket . I thought the flavor of the box version of zico was ok so I figured they just redesigned their package ... Boy was I wrong ! I took a sip and as fast as the liquid entered my mouth , it also left the other way ! Yuck ! It tastes like really sugary old coconuts . I then looked at the ingredients and see `` premium coconut water from concentrate , natural flavors . `` I just do n't get it : Why would they go from using fresh coconut water in their box version to concentrated coconut water in this not very environmental friendly plastic bottle -- and charge more for it ! ? Am I missing something ? The taste is horrible and I really wish they would go back to their original formulation . There are enough pure coconut water products like vita coco , one , on the market , so why settle for something from concentrate , pay more for it , and hurt the planet with more plastic ?	-1
I used to love Zico coconut water . No any more . This new formula is terrible . It taste nothing like how coconut water is supposed to taste . First , is that this now comes in a plastic bottle and is from concentrate , with the added ingredient of `` natural flavors '' , whatever those may be . I do n't know how to put it into words , but it just lacks vitality and freshness that should be in coconut water . It taste nothing like their previous product which comes in the paper Tetra-Pak cartons : ZICO Pure Premium Coconut Water , Natural , 11.2-Ounce Tetra Paks ( Pack of 12 ) .These may be cost-cutting moves and they show . This product is terrible . Go with the original non-concentrate Tetra-paks .	-1
I have bought the version in the boxes before , but thought the plastic bottles would be more convenient . Unfortunately it makes the drink taste like plastic . The plastic taste is very strong , and awful . Stick to the boxed type .	-1
I never write reviews . This is my first out of 900+ unique products bought from Amazon . I average about 1 to 2 packages a day of various products bought from amazon . THIS PRODUCT IS A COMPLETE FAILURE ! I bought 3 cases and all 3 were RANCID/SPOILED ! It literally tastes like VOMIT ! Avoid this product , Quality Assurance is a major issue . VITACOCO is better in terms of quality ( VITACOCO also adds a little extra vitamin C to avoid some spoliage while shipping ) . I will NEVER BUY ZICO again , that is for certain ! I hope this helps others avoid the poorest excuse for any type of quality coconut water .	-1
Ick ! This stuff is disgusting ... why anyone would subject themselves to `` Nature 's Sports Drink '' is beyond me ! If you 're looking for coconut water at least choose the brand without all the added ingredients !	-1
I ordered 4 count of 12 packs ..and one pack was so good and pure..and some of them are spoiled..may be they are from spoiled coconuts..Zico should take care of these issuesZICO Pure Premium Coconut Water , Natural , 11.2-Ounce Tetra Paks ( Pack of 12 )	-1
I love coconut water . To be more specific , I love GOOD coconut water . My preferred brand after trying just about every one on the market is the Taste Nirvana which is smooth , only slightly sweet and very refreshing . The Taste Nirvana Lite with pulp is a bout 50 % sweeter than the regular and is very good as well with the pulp being crisp and fresh . Goya runs a close second . I am not sure if it 's the tetra packs or just the coconut water itself that makes Zico taste a little sour to me . Coconut water should not taste sour . Despite the rave reviews , I think the Zico water is just not as good as the Nirvana or Goya . Sorry I bought a whole case without trying it first .	-1
Overall decent taste , but not what I expected . Also did not expect this to be coconut water from CONCENTRATE . I will read the fine print better next time . 100 % pure coconut water is always better IMHO.The added sugar would not really be necessary if it 's pure coconut water , not from concentrate .	-1
Maybe it 's the fact that Amazon 's stock is ( apparently ) bad , or maybe I do n't like Coconut as much as I thought I did ( and I like Coconut , so I assume it 's the former ) but this stuff tastes terrible ... I took one sip and poured the rest down the sink.Amazon was kind enough to issue a refund on this order , but until Zico fixes their shipments I 'd stay away from this product !	-1
I purchased several of these the other day after all of the hype I 've heard surrounding them.Long story short , they taste awful . I ca n't quite place the taste , but it just reminds me of something that 's very stale and expired tasting . Very unpleasant , to the point where I threw out the bottle after a few sips .	-1
I somehow managed to drink one bottle ( it was hot , I was desperate ) . It really tastes bad . I have all the rest sitting in my cabinet , never to be sipped by me . When I am dead , I 'm sure they will be thrown away . I know , what do I mean by `` bad . '' Well , I almost felt like I would get sick if I drank a whole bottle straight . Maybe it is good for you , but the taste is so raunchy that I would have to be on a desert island to drink it .	-1
I did n't like this brand of coconut water it has a strange after taste . There are other brands out there that are a lot better .	-1
Each pak is sealed well . But the liquid is cloudy yellow and very bitter , with no coconut flavor or odor at all , so I do n't know if it tastes the way it 's supposed to . Please let me know if this is normal for this brand or not . I 'm tempted to throw them all out .	-1
I buy Coconut Water for as my hydration drink because of its Potassium contents ( nutrient good for the muscles ) after workout . But I found a different brand that has more Potassium . This brand has less Potassium content per serving .	-1
Some people love coconut water . After choking down one of these , I knew I was not one of them . I would describe the flavor as sweet sweat . Of course , I have never drank a cup of sweat with sugar but imagine the taste would not be too far off from this product . Kind of salty , kind of sweet yet totally gross.So , so glad I tried a single first ! Gag-o-rama .	-1
It is much cheaper than Cafe Coco , and I like the other flavors , such as chocolate cream . But this one just tastes funny . Not like a latte , not like coconut water . Just ... weird . Maybe it 's that this one 's vegan ( no dairy ) and Cafe Coco contains some real milk . But if you want a real latte flavor with the health benefits of coconut water , stick to Cafe Coco .	-1
I love the Zico coconut water in the little Tetra Pak boxes . It 's my favorite drink . I should have read the reviews for the Zico in the plastic bottles , but it never occurred to me that the same brand could be so different . This is n't even close to the same taste . It 's disgusting . I ca n't even describe how bad it is . Something like liquid plastic flavor with slight fermentation . AWFUL ! Please do not order this product if you think you like Zico coconut water in the Tetra Paks . If anyone tried this they would think coconut water is the most vile substance on earth .	-1
I like coconut water but this flavor was awful . I was really disappointed . It was cloying on the palette . We will not be purchasing this again .	-1
I noticed Jessica Alba promoting ZICO while taking credit as a well behaved , caring parent who had many health issues when she was a child and now how proud she is being part of these fine companies including ZICO ( meaning she shares the profit of the sales ) . Let 's look at some facts on ZICO ; 1 . INGREDIENT : all natural coconut water . Ask yourself , have you ever seen a natural food item , any food item even a coconut water when you crack a fresh coconut , where the natural water of that coconut to last for months in any temperature . No it will not last more than few hours so why is it that Jessica is not disclosing the preservatives that are included inside ZICO cartons and bottles when infact you will get no preservatives when cracking a fresh coconut and drinking the coconut juice for a dollar a coconut instead of four dollars for ZICO . With fresh coconut you will even end up with fresh coconut meat as well , ,2 . HYDRATE : hydration requires consuming water at zero calories , not sugar . You can drink all the coconut juices in the world and it still will not hydrate unless you drink water . Sugar will force you to drink water so you will have to consume water after drinking ZICO,3 . HAND HARVEST COCONUTS FROM AROUND THE WORLD : meaning not a Fair Trade certified product . Meaning ZICO is the same as Coco Cola , the same as the competition without Fair Trade certification,4 . AS MUCH POTASSIUM AS A SMALL BANANA : Let ' compare based on NUTRITION FACTS . For a cup comparison although not the same since we are comparing liquid with solid , but regardless ZICO vs. banana in calories 50/33 , potassium 360/317 , sugar 10/2.4 and tall of that not considering where banana offers 3.7mg of Phytosterols in lowering cholesterol , all other vitamins and minerals from 171 % vitamin C , A , K , B6 , fiber , and all minerals where ZICO offers none other than sugar in a processed container.It is fine to consume a processed food or drink if one wishes to do so but for Jessica Alba is purely misleading public while acting as a caring individual . ZICO is a processed drink in a carton , which has a whopping 40gr of sugar processed just like other coconut water brands , like Coca-Cola , not a Fair Trade product which has nothing to do with hydration or banana . I drink coconut water by cracking cold coconuts that I keep in my refrigerator and understand the nutritional value of each when a fresh coconut costs me a dollar , a banana twenty five cents not four dollars for a processed coconut in container with preservative .	-1
This coconut water has a very weird smell and a bad after taste like its an old coconut . The other coconut water I have had is the Vita coco and it 's not bad but it 's better than this Zico . Zico does not taste fresh at all . If you do n't breath , you can drink it down . I 'm going to give the rest of the cartons to my mom ; I hope she likes it ! Ewww !	-1
I grew up with fresh coconuts . I also grew up with canned coconut juice ( sweetened ) , frozen coconut juice , and recently bought some Naked coconut water from the supermarket , so I 'm familiar with how coconut water should taste.It 's hard to get fresh coconut where I am now so I thought I 'd give Zico a try since it was the cheapest available on Amazon . Big mistake ! I should 've listened to the recent negative reviews posted here.The first pack of Zico was sour . I took a sip and made a face . Crap , I thought , I got a bad one . I then opened another pack and that too was sour . I have never tried Zico before and I hope that this is n't what it 's SUPPOSED to taste like because it tastes nothing like coconut water . If I had been blindfolded and somebody handed me this drink , I would never be able to guess it was supposed to be coconut water . Packaged coconut water is supposed to taste similar to the juice you get in fresh coconut , right ? I understand that it 's not going to taste just like fresh coconuts but there should be a marked resemblance , as there was with the Naked brand I tried . But the Zico I tried tasted NOTHING like coconut . It MIGHT taste like the water that comes from a totally unripe coconut ( never having had an unripe coconut , I ca n't say ) , or it could be the taste of coconut water gone rancid . Whatever the reason , the taste is totally wrong and I am pissed because I 've now got a 12-pack that 's too disgusting to drink and is n't eligible for a refund through Amazon.UPDATE : Grocery items are not returnable , per Amazon policies ( NOW they tell me ) . However , I contacted Amazon to explain the situation to them and they generously offered to issue me a full refund . Excellent customer service by Amazon -- though the Zico still stinks !	-1
I love coconut juice but I do n't love this . I should also mention that I love pina coladas too . Though I understand that pina coladas are made with coconut MILK and not coconut juice , I thought there would be some parallels.First of all , this drink has a strange salty flavor . Secondly , it 's not sweet . It SMELLS sweet and pineapple-y , but the flavors just do n't coordinate with each other and do n't match the smell .	-1
Sorry but it does not make it , very very very ( that 's three very 's ) weak taste . Basically water with a hint of Coconut .	-1
Although Zico may claim to be natural , I disagree since it is made from concentrate . I prefer to drink Vita Coco , which is a much more flavorful brand of coconut water and is actually 100 % NATURAL !	-1
This water is disgusting and tastes like another brand also sold at Costco . The after taste is stale bread , I ordered 2 cases of http : //www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00BN6BX9M/ref=oh_details_o08_s00_i00 ? ie=UTF8 & psc ; =1 when I got this with a coupon and subscribe & save discount and now I 'm choking this down.Move on to something else if you want a clean crisp coconut water , this definitely is n't it !	-1
This is the most disgusting coconut water I 've ever had . It is brown , and tastes rotted . I buy the & # 34 ; ONE & # 34 ; brand as well , and that one comes out of the package a clear color with very slightly white tint . If you pour a glass of this next to the other one , the difference is shocking . Zico 's is a very noticeable brown color and tastes of rotting plant material.I called amazon about the first package I received , and they sent me a new one - also brown and disgusting . I will not buy any more of this . EVER .	-1
Really the chocolate flavor is kind of gross and there are little particles of stuff floating around in the liquid . Gross	-1
I used to love the old Zico when it went straight from the coconut into the container . Now that it 's made from concentrate it tastes weak and spoiled . This will be my last box of ever of Zico . I 'll be going back to O.N.E . or Vita Coco .	-1
there is something terribly wrong with this , it is super cloudy and it makes me naseated . I had finished a store bought tetra pack of coco libre a day before this came so I know i am not allergic to coconut water- there is something off with this Zico .	-1
It comes in a very lovely box and attractive packaging , but is totally funky tasting , like sour milk mixed with stagnant water . I am a big coconut water fan and would barely recognize this as coconut water when compared to other things I have tasted .	-1
Absolutely horrid . I love Zico in the tetra paks . It 's the best packaged coconut water I 've tasted . However this product in the bottle had the worst plastic taste imaginable . I ca n't believe Zico would put out a product that tastes this bad . Maybe it was stored under poor conditions , but I will never buy Zico in this format ever again .	-1
Does n't taste like real coconut water . They may have used extremely young coconuts ( that are are not desirable ) or some second-rate coconut crop .	-1
This is better than the pomegranate flavor but just barely . The pure stuff is so much better . I 'll be sticking to that .	-1
First sip had me feeling sick ! I 'm not sure if it is because I just do n't like Passion Fruit or because I do n't like Passion fruit and coconut water . I really wanted to like this flavor but luckily Amazon gave me a refund so it was n't too bad of a deal for me . I 'll stick with the delicious chocolate flavor : ) .	-1
I 've tried five flavors of Spry gum : peppermint , spearmint , green tea , fresh fruit , and cinnamon . Spearmint is among my least favorite flavors , beating out only peppermint . It loses its flavor within two minutes . That 's not an exaggeration - you get literally two minutes of chewing pleasure . The main reason I prefer it to peppermint is that at least the spearmint goes tasteless , while the peppermint turns bitter.On the bright side , the gum is flavored with xylitol . Unlike some brands that advertise that they contain xylitol , Spry actually uses it as their only sweetener . Most sugarless gums make me sick , as I ca n't handle sorbitol and maltitol well . At least I can chew this without having intestinal problems , which makes it worth two stars despite the lack of flavor .	-1
this is one of the worst gums I have ever had . It taste stale and old and the flavor lasts about 1 minute . warning , do not purchase , if you do you will be sorry .	-1
While the flavour of this gum is nice , I agree with other reviewers who say the flavour does n't last very long . Not only that , but the pieces are quite small , so you have to chew 2 or 3 of them to really get any flavour . Disappointing .	-1
It was okay for about 30 seconds then most of the flavor had gone and the gum was hard to chew . It also started to get an off taste . I was hoping it was going to be good , I have tried the mints and there pretty good , different but good . I would agree with another reviewer that it 's like chewing on a piece of rubber .	-1
I DID N'T LIKE THE TEXTURE AND IT WAS WAY TOO SWEET . I WAS THINKING IT WOULD BE MORE LIKE CORN POPS .	-1
I will not buy this again all the grocery and personal items such as six bars of soap items were thrown together with no care as to breakage or damage .	-1
no cheese flavor at all to us three that had some	-1
I 've bought these in the grocery store before , but apparently I 'd forgotten how bland they are . There are better things like this out there , and cheaper too , so I will not buy these again .	-1
Boy was I dissapointed in these babies . I thought that they would taste like an actually puff , but they tasted like nothing , honestly . I love pirates booty , that is my favorite and one that I am going to stick to . These taste like a very very weark version of pirates booty , no flavor to speak of at all and not worth the money . So I would buy a bag at a store first to try before purchasing online in a large amount . Dont expect much flavor or anything form this snack , unless your into eating flavorless food .	-1
I bought these because my daughter wanted something for a school snack , had tried these in the cafeteria and said that they `` were n't bad '' . Unfortunately , she had changed her mind by the time the gigantic box arrived on the doorstep . My huband and I tried them , and I feel like giving a stern punishment to the maker of these things . Besides having no discernable nutritional content , these things have too much salt , too much fake `` cheez '' powder , and no way to remove it gracefully after you'e eaten a few puffs . We do n't like them , and I feel terrible dumping them on the food pantry . Perhaps I 'll hide them in a large donation of healthier items .	-1
I actually love Pirate 's Booty snacks so I was over eager and purchased 2 huge cases of these . Yikes , these are going to hard to get rid of . A previous reviewer states that they are like fish food and I second that notion . I would definitely recommend steering clear of these , and choosing one of the much better flavors like cheese . I do n't know exactly how to describe these , but imagine a stale sock soaked in broccoli juice and you 're on the right track . My typically non-discriminating 14 month old turns his nose up at these . These taste like something super healthy , and though they are n't bad for you , they are not healthy enough to warrant choking them down . They are worth a try as a toddler snack , but I 'd order cautiously or you will have lots of fish food tasting snacks that you will be trying to give away to any unsuspecting victim that will take them off of your hands .	-1
I am a vegetarian , health food buyer for many years . This product is not fresh . Definitely stale . I purchased for my classroom and have given them the same product before with no problem . When purchasing from the product this time the taste is not fresh at all ! Extremely upset about the quality of this product when purchased this time . I do not have money to waste and I know many others reading this do not have money to waste . Do not buy it , ,	-1
Another reason not to buy this ( from Newdsay ) : '' A Sea Cliff food company said Thursday it was recalling a snack called Veggie Booty because it had been alerted by the federal government of possible salmonella contamination. '' Ouch ! Eating this product will not only make you fat , but now it could kill you ! Make your own popcorn instead .	-1
I used to really like this snack but this shipment just seemed very stale and tasteless . I ca n't remember why I liked them	-1
Normally I love love love this product but it tasted odd and I ended up throwing it all away . I wont order it again	-1
This company uses cheap products from Chinathat are poisen . ( remember when Veggie Booty was recalled 2 years ago ? ) Plus , this product is anything but healthy , get real .	-1
I prefer the Cheetos brand . These do not have as much tangy cheese flavor as Cheetos and do n't have as much of the good corn meal taste and texture . I have 11 1/2 bags left and went to the local store to buy more Cheetos .	-1
THIS SNACK IS `` OK '' ... 2 OR 3 STARS ... FIRST , THESE ARE INDEED JUNK FOOD ... ONE THIRD CALORIES FROM FAT , HIGH GLYCEMIC CARBS , 1 GRAM FIBER , 2 GRAMS PROTEIN . SECOND , THE CHEESE FLAVOR IS MILDER THAN THE `` AGED WHITE CHEDDAR '' LED ME TO BELIEVE . THE TEXTURE WAS THAT OF VERY SOFT STYROFOAM PACKING PEANUTS . SORRY , BUT IT 'S TRUE ! IF SOMEONE OFFERED ME SOME AT THE MOVIES OR NEXT TO A SANDWICH ... OK , SURE ... BUT THE GUSHING PRAISE I READ HERE LED ME TO PURCHASE A 12 BAG CASE WHILE THEY WERE ON SALE ... I WILL BE SHARING THESE FREELY ... NO TEMPTATION TO HOARD THEM . THEY 'RE JUST `` OK '' ... IF I COULD GIVE A BAG TO THE BIG FANS , IT WOULD BE MY PLEASURE .	-1
( I wonder if anyone else has seen the '' Saturday Night Live '' sketch about a convention of pirates whose discourse is limited to the '' arrrgh '' sound . ) This product tastes like alfalfa/barley juice , except the popcorn texture makes it difficult to make the taste go away simply by holding your nose . As for all the health benefits , the veggies indeed impart `` flavor '' to this mish-mash , a bag of which equals 8 grams of protein plus nearly 600 calories , but what do the veggies contribute and what percentage of the product do they represent ? Unless I notice some dramatic health benefits , I 'm going to have trouble disposing of 12 bags ( Lesson : Even though Amazon limits you to large quantities , do n't order 12 bags if you have n't first tried one ) . The only way I can consume this stuff is to wash down every bite with a mouthful of cold Coke . Or , picking up on the company 's pirate theme , Coke laced with a lot of rum . Unassisted by such complementary beverages , I 'm afraid this booty elicits no pirate 's celebratory `` Arrrgh ! '' from me . Just plain `` Yuck ! '' is more like it .	-1
Maybe it 's just us , but we do n't prefer this flavor . To us it takes kind of bitter . Hoping we can get through the case .	-1
I did research on whole bean vanilla and was very eager to get it , but was terribly disappointed . No matter how I used it , it had no real vanilla flavor or smell . I returned them and got a refund .	-1
Arrived quickly ..packaged as described .. Beans looked plump , However not so sure about the product .. First time with vanilla beans so not quite sure what they are suppose to look like ..only a very faint , faint smell of Vanilla ..smelled more of Bourbon than Vanilla ..Used 80 proof Vodka and half of the beans ..but it looked like mildew floating with the Vodka as well in my canning jar .. since I used a sterile jar ... it 's not from my jar ... they arrived quickly so I figure they came that way ... did n't see the mildew till I put it in with the Vodka..did a video on my phone of the floating mildew but ca n't get it uploaded ( not sure how just yet but will figure it out soon and leave an update ) after looking up further on another site what they are to smell and look like .. I feel I got a poor quality and even mildewed product .. tried to leave a review of 3 stars because I was unsure of the product and it would n't let me thus the 2 stars ... did not contact the seller since I could not leave the feedback ! Will not be using this product or the rest of the beans since I already lost out on the Vodka as well.. This is my first bad review on a product .. been using Amazon since the 90 's and had great luck on all the other products I have ordered ..I hate leaving bad reviews is why I waited and the product received great reviews is why I ordered them .	-1
On the first gritty batch , I blamed user error . I figured I had something burnt on the pot . maybe . Or perhaps the sauce packet had n't dissolved all the way . I 've made mac and cheese plenty of times , but HEY , it 's always possible . For the second batch , I was extra careful . It still turned out gritty . The only reason this Mac and cheese got two stars instead of one is that it 's edible . If the zombie apocalypse comes , I 'll still have these in the cupboard to eat .	-1
This is twice as expensive as basic box Mac and Cheese . It is just so so in taste . If you check the ingredients it is not much different than other Mac and Cheese . The cost does not justify the ordering . I will not be ordering from Amazon again . The cost is much cheaper at a big box chain .	-1
Okay , it 's organic . But the taste is awful . Acrid sour and fake . I will only eat it again if the zombie apocalypse happens	-1
do n't see how this is listed , with several other similar products from the same company , as `` prepared meal '' ; you do n't have milk or yogurt , no go ; to me , that definition is met by , for instance , some of the pad thai nuker boxes ; open noodle package , sauce package , combine in box , nuke 2min and ready to eat ; what this amounts to is a company selling a very small amount of pasta that 's wildly overpriced compared to a standard box in the s'market- and still needs to be cooked the same way , no nuking short cuts- plus a tiny package of dried cheese sauce ; do n't get it ; it 's not nukable , not quick , not complete	-1
I agree with the other reviewer who called this bland . While eating this , it seemed like I was eating boiled noodles with a little milk poured on top . I could n't taste ANY cheese flavor.For those who do n't want to make their own mac & cheese , basically ANY brand of frozen mac & cheese is better than this box mix -- and most frozen mac & cheese meals are n't very good , either . Best pre-prepared mac & cheese : a tie between Amy 's ( VERY strong cheese flavor ) and Trader Joe 's `` reduced guilt '' ( you can tell there 's real cheese in it , though the cheese they use is n't as sharp as I 'd like ) . Yes , both of these are more expensive than this box mix , but if you 're willing to eat this stuff you really should just buy your pasta separately and then sprinkle some grated parmesan cheese on top ; you 'll save money and at least you 'll get some cheese flavor .	-1
You might as well just eat plain pasta without any cheese ... you ca n't even taste the cheese in this stuff ! Completely & totally tasteless . Sad . Not even worth the time it takes to prepare .	-1
After years of consuming preservatives I have developed an intolerance to them . Look up Sodium Phosphate side effects . We bought Annie 's because it was Organic . Who knew they would add a chemical to it ? I got very sick after eating it . It really is n't Organic if it has chemicals in it .	-1
Because of tummy troubles , my doctor ordered me on a very bland diet . Well this stuff is JUST what the doctor ordered , as it is almost completely tasteless . I ca n't give it a one star which qualifies as hating it , as I ca n't hate anything that has pasta as one of the ingredients , but it is not good . It makes Kraft Mac and Cheese seem very exciting ! I would not reorder and would fear ordering anything else from Annie 's . This would only be for young children who hate anything with a taste to it .	-1
This pasta was absolutely terrible . I bought two boxes and made one the other day . The smell was interesting , but the taste was awful . It literally made me want to throw up - and I usually love Annie 's products . I 'm wishing I had n't bought two boxes because the second box is going to go in the donation pile for the food bank .	-1
Tastes like sick chemicals . I can not imagine any child eating this and liking it , same goes with all of Annie 's mac and cheese products . Sauce is thin , noodles are too small , and it tastes like vomit or stomach acid ( I 'm serious ) . Kraft now makes Organic mac and cheese and it 's DELICIOUS , I 'm eating some right now .	-1
Was very disappointed , there was no real cheese flavor . Had to add our own extra sharp cheddar to give it pop . Also , cheese sauce did n't cover the noodles well .	-1
I normally love everything made by Annie 's and often buy the bunny grahams and fruit snacks for my grandson . However , I was stunned by how much I hated this mac and cheese mix ! ! It 's absolutely awful -- the cheese sauce tastes artificial and leaves a weird aftertaste . Sorry Annie , but wo n't purchase this again . I will give it one star for being organic .	-1
This the only product of Annie 's that I am disappointed in . The cheese powder is not nearly as flavorful as Annie 's creamy delux mac and cheese with the foil packet of cheese sauce ( which my family and I all love and will be the only kind I buy from now on ) .	-1
I 've bought many Annie 's products , including another type of mac & cheese , so I was expecting to like this item as well . I eat whole grain pasta all the time and love it . With this product , I think it was more the cheese sauce than the pasta that turned me off . I found it watery and did n't think there was enough of it , although I 'm not sure if having more of something I did n't really like would be an improvement.I 'll stick to other kinds of mac & cheese and skip this in the future .	-1
I keep hearing about how wonderful is Annie 's pasta so I tried this product . A big mistake . The sauce is extremely SALTY . I should not have purchase this product as now I have so many boxes remaining . I 'll just keep the pasta and toss out the sauce packets . Stay away if you do not like your food over-salted .	-1
It tastes absolutely the same as any other store mac-and-cheese . The `` totally natural '' cheese is a fine-as-talcum-powder substance in a foil packet . Save some money and buy the store brand for 69 cents on sale at Ralph 's Market .	-1
There 's just not enough cheese powder in here to cover the amount of pasta in each box . Flavor is decent but there 's just not enough of it , and it 's very difficult to get the pasta to the right texture .	-1
I really wanted to like these , but unfortunately , ca n't stand the taste of the cheese sauce . ( I do n't care for Kraft either ) .The ingredients are better in Annies Homegrown Mac & Cheese , so if I could stand the taste , I 'd eat it without question . But the taste is , is my opinion , acidic and just bad . Almost like another reviewer said : vomit-like.Now what will I do with the case that is left ?	-1
The cheese sauce is Very Mild , and tasteless- I 'm not in to trying to doctor it up ... My biggest complaint is with the Shells ( calls for boiling 8-10min ) -At 10min they are still Very grainy.At 13min they are n't much softer.YUCK !	-1
I found this product to be tasteless . Even a dollar store product has more flavor than this does . Iwould never buy this brand again and would not recomend it to anyone .	-1
I had to try another box before I wrote this review because it seems hard to believe that I 'm the only reviewer who did n't enjoy these . Particularly when someone specifically said `` they 're not too salty '' . I 'm not sure if we got an overly-salted batch , but I 'm definitely not on board.My wife and I both felt they were very salty . We were hoping to give them to our baby who 's starting on biscuits now but we also want to avoid too much salt.I have a hard time telling if the strong flavor is from the salt or the cheddar.Out of the 5 people who tried it here , only my brother said `` Mmmmmm Cheddar '' . I gave him the remaining 11 boxes and hope I have better luck with the Chocolate flavored ones .	-1
These are god awful crackers , thay dont taste like anything close to white cheddar , they taste like a flavorless cracker . I am upset that I wasted my money on these nasty things . I love annies products but this is not a winner in my book . I have heard that the sour cream and onion are the best so I am going to give those a try next but word of warning , buy one box at a store first before purchasing online , you will be glad you did . The big reason I love annies so much is everything they make is sutibale for vegetarians , meaning they use renetless free cheese so thats why I love them .	-1
first of all , these little bunnies are delicious . as the saying goes , 'you ca n't eat just one'so why do i hate them ? because its all a lie . shame . bs . there is more salt in these treats than in your back of potato chips . more salt than SALTED PRETZELS . i know because i just came from the grocery store where i checked the bags / boxes.annies with their cute little bunny and hype about 'oh gee , you can make book marks out of this box ' is a load of advertising hype . the remaining ingredients/ nutrients ? well , i sought out this whole wheat bunny from their assortment - and only ordered it because it DOES have some fiber - organic [ good ] . but the other bunnies do n't - besides that , there is nothing else to merit this happy dappy pile of bunny-droppings.ps . i just opened another box and am munching away while i type . delicious .	-1
I 'm glad I bought one box at Whole Foods before ordering a case of this stuff . Most Annie 's products I 've tried are good , but my husband ( who LOVES mac & cheese ) took one bite and said , & # 34 ; Cardboard , & # 34 ; and would n't eat anymore . I 'm the health food nut in the family , and I thought I would at least be able to eat it , but there 's no taste at all , especially no cheese , so why bother ? I guess I could have added enough cheese to give it a flavor , but that 's not why I bought it . I ca n't imagine why so many people say they love it .	-1
These are without a doubt the worst Mac & Cheese I have ever had . I am on a Gluten Free Diet and while most gluten free are not as good as regular food items there are awful . We tried adding chili , and other items to help improve the taste and texture but they are so bad they ruined the chili !	-1
Terrible , gritty , bland noodles that are n't anything near the consistency of wheat pasta . Under-spiced sauce with very little cheesy `` bite '' . Pass on this one , and just use gluten-free cheese sauce packets on on a better pasta , such as Tinkyada 's Brown Rice pasta or any other brand that actually tastes and feels like real pasta . This is a waste of money and a real let down from a company whose mac'n'cheese I really loved back when I ate gluten	-1
I generally like Annie 's products and really appreciate what they are trying to do , especially in offering gluten-free items . That being said , I tried this Mac & Cheese made with rice pasta and was seriously underwhelmed.For one thing , there were n't that many servings , especially if you are making this a main part of your meal . Secondly , the cheese mix was very bland . I had to doll it up with pepper and even some garlic salt before I could eat any of it . Even then ... there is no way this tastes in any way , shape , or form like regular Mac & Cheese.The rice pasta cooked up nicely , which is a plus , but I would never use the cheese mix again . So I guess I might as well , at that point , buy my own rice pasta and mix up my own cheesy mixture to go over it . Takes more work , but why use something convenient like Mac & Cheese in a box if you do n't end up enjoying the end product ? Definitely a pass . Sadly . If Annie 's takes it back to the drawing board and makes the cheesy mix something tastier I would be willing to give it a second try .	-1
think it 's add water and nuke ? nope ; you get 12 small boxes not half filled with pasta and a small pack of squishy cheddar ; boil 10-12 the way you would with other pasta , then the cheese- oh , and then you need milk- for # 30 some bucks ? ; get a real box of gluten-free pasta , a chunk of cheddar and a quart of milk for maybe 1/4 of this ripoff ; it 's just standard ingredients- not quick , not in a container to nuke or heat- divided up into 12 little boxes ; look down and read all the cooking directions and it does say add milk but not up front about the product	-1
Our gluten-free family of five has tried this several times and everyone seemed to lose their appetite when this was prepared . The cheese sauce comes in a packet that you squeeze on the noodles . Everyone agreed that the sauce is too cheesy , thick , and the flavor is not as good as other brands/styles . Mac & Cheese is a staple in our house , but we wo n't order this one again .	-1
My son did not like this very much . It was hard being diagnosed just before 12 years old when he hit puberty it set in . We really enjoy the corn pasta . It holds up better and better flavor !	-1
I love the regular Annie 's Rice Mac and Cheese , but this stuff tastes artificial . The cheese has more resemblance to processed Velveeta oil-based cheese than the quality flavor I 'm used to from Annie 's . Bottom line , the convenience is n't worth it . Buy the powder version of Annie 's Rice Mac and Cheese instead .	-1
Wow ! I do n't know what the story is with this macaroni and cheese , but it has an awful bitter taste when it is going down your throat . The taste is so bad that when I went to wash it down with ginger ale and it made the ginger taste awful too . You know when something tastes so bad that no matter how much you drink the bad taste is like pasted onto to your tongue and all liquid that comes in contact with it is morphed into a different but equally gross taste ? Well , that is what was going on here . I tried eating it because I was hungry and I thought this would be a quick fix , but it was so bad that both my hunger and my grumbling stomach agreed and said , & # 34 ; It 's okay , now worries , we 'll hang on until you can get some real food , but for the love of god stop eating this crap. & # 34 ;	-1
The case was packaged with other foods and 1/2 of the cans were VERY dented . The boxed foods came fine and nothing else in the box was crushed or dented which means the cans were dented when they were put into the box for shipping . I would definitely not purchase cans this way again .	-1
I had to look down to make sure I was n't eating the box the shipment came in . The sauce has no flavor ; there is no cheese taste . Serving suggestion : clothes pin on the nose and a few drips of Tobasco . Or eat it when you have a cold -- and blame the lack of flavor on your health .	-1
Very bland tasting . Since , I ordered a 12 pack without trying one out first , I now have to dress it up to eat it . It has very little sauce so I usually add marinara sauce , salsa or as a last resort ketchup in order to tolerate it .	-1
This is definitely a kid-friendly , super-easy ( open and heat ) product . Easy to serve and usually welcomed with excitement by the under-7 set based on looks alone . BUT if you think these are a super-healthy option just because they are organic , you 're definitely kidding yourself . Organic or not , this is still stuffed with sodium and preservatives , albeit of the more natural variety -- it is , after all , canned , pre-cooked food . Better than a trip through the McDonald 's drive thru ? I 'd say , yeah , probably , especially with a vegetable side . Healthier than just about any other non-prepackaged pasta option , organic or otherwise ? Umm , not likely.As for taste , the reviewer who called these pasta in tomato soup just about nailed the flavor profile , though the mushy pasta was n't pointed out ( perhaps implied ? ) . Honestly , in the one time we tried these , when my four-year-old was left with a babysitter that I do n't really want to ask to cook anything , he was excited at first , but then barely ate any.In general , I think Annie 's tends to make tasty , convenient products that are a healthier ( note I did n't say `` healthy '' ) choice than similar products , but this one seems like a miss . If you must have processed convenience food on hand -- and , c'mon , I do my best , but we 're all human , and busy -- I think there are plenty of tastier and more nutritious options out there , including other Annie 's Organics products .	-1
I was really looking forward to microwavable mac & cheese , but this tasted so bitter and horrible . I checked the date to use by , and it was far in the future . I tried another packet on another day in case it was a fluke , but the same vile taste was present . I discarded the rest of the box . My guess is that something was wrong with the whole package , and it 's probably not common , but just in case , I will not be ordering this again .	-1
I give this product two stars because there are no artificial ingredients and it is 75 % organic . That is all it has going for it.I 'm trying to go `` all natural '' and `` organic '' with all my purchases . I saw this for about $ 5 for the five pack and since the price was comparable to the Velveeta version ( which is far from `` all natural '' ) I bought it.Stirring the cheese sauce into the leftover water from cooking the macaroni took a few minutes . I did not time it , but it was more than two minutes . My son would not eat it . I made myself a package . It tastes kind of like macaroni with Cheetos powder on it ( although I think Cheetos powder would taste better ) . I wound up melting a piece of organic American Cheese on it and stirring that in to make it palatable.I think I 'm going to try to figure out how to microwave a small amount of regular macaroni then melt cheese on it in the microwave to make my own macaroni and cheese.This product was a big fail in my household.This is the first Annie 's product that I have tried that I did not like . Before trying this stuff , I was 100 % satisfied with Annie 's products .	-1
Ok , I love mac & cheese in the blue box . This one is not at all like that . I 'm thinking it is because it has less saltiness . Not cheesy enough for me but its handy for lunch .	-1
I really wanted to like this . You have to buy a case at a time which equals to 30 servings . I would advise adding a little bit more water to the macaroni as it came out of the microwave too dry . Also , if you really like to add extra salt to your food , you 'll probably like this because it has a very salty taste .	-1
Have enjoyed Annie 's White Mac & Cheese very much , but this microwavable variety is more trouble than its worth . You must use a very deep & wide bowl to use in the microwave or the water will boil over and you 'll be left with very hot , uncooked macaroni in the bowl and a starchy mess in the microwave . It is much easier to make the conventional variety in a pot !	-1
I only tried this 1st time but this did n't cook well compared to boiling maybe I did n't follow instructions but the macaronis are very tiny , much tinier than normal . Sauce did n't mix well . So the combination , not worth it . I assume this applies to all flavors	-1
Just hated this mac and cheese . So artificial , yuck and made me sick in the stomach . I bought a whole lot and could not eat more than two packs . Gave away some to friends and neighbor kids and everyone hated it . Worst mac and cheese ever . Look at the ingredients and calories - not healthy either . I simply wasted my money .	-1
Quite frankly , we think this soup is disgusting . There is no flavor to it whatsoever , and if I accidentally buy it , hoping a different flavor will be better , my husband ( who eats ANYTHING ! ) just groans and chokes it down . The only thing good about it is that it does have more `` stuff '' in it to fill you up , but just no taste . After you dump about a pound of salt into them , they resemble something with some flavor , but not really . It 's healthy all right , but there are many other products out there that are just as healthy but have all the flavor as well . If you do n't like spices , then this is your soup . However , since I make my own and we 're more used to flavor , this one just does n't cut the broth .	-1
Heating as directed in the microwave , the heated contents blew the lid off the container , and a substantial quantity boiled over into the microware which I am still cleaning . It might be a nice product if it could be safely heated.I do not have this problem with other brands .	-1
I bought this recently , not paying attention to brand . When I got it home , I realized it was Stash , and thought , oh , no , here comes the weak tea ! Indeed , as with other of their teas , it is weak . I used up almost the entire box of tea bags to make a pitcher full of iced tea , and it was still pretty weak in flavor . When I 've made hot tea with it , I need two tea bags.The flavor is ok -- I love the tartness of hibiscus and the raspberry -- but it 's really just too weak overall . Will not purchase again .	-1
The Licorice spice tea is fragrant and delicious.I was given some to try , and was so excited about this tea . I added it to my amazon.comsubscriptions . Several days later I mentioned this tea to my Doctor . He gave me astrict warning against ANY kind od black Licorice.This tea and all black licorice products need clearly posted warnings.Not for consumption by anyone with high Blood pressure , or on blood pressure medicines.The package had not yet arrived , I contacted amazon for return instructions and was told it is not return or refundable ! Very unhappy : ( Stash Premium Licorice Spice Herbal Tea , Tea Bags , 20-Count Boxes ( Pack of 6 )	-1
I am used to Yogi Tea 's Lemon Ginger Tea , and for a change I wanted to try Stash's.Unfortunately , I will go back to Yogi Tea 's Lemon Ginger which tastes much nicer .	-1
I have , in the past , positively reviewed other Stash flavors , Ginger Lemon and Holiday Chai . Had a problem with the Double Bergamot tea once , but then a second shipment was excellent . This Double Chai Spice has a strange chemical flavor . Tried mixing it with regular black tea because the chai seems to be lacking a tea flavor . Of course , I added milk and honey . I have tried other brands of chai and have made my own . There 's something off about this - it 's got a strongly astringent , bitter flavor . I wonder if it 's because the spices are ground to a powder ? The best chai is made with whole spices .	-1
I 'm looking for a really good chai to make at home . This had good reviews and my local grocery store actually carried it . I brought it home , made a cup and literally could n't drink it . I had to put 3 tsp the sugar in it and extra cream to even be able to take a few sips . And thats reslly saying domething because i usually take little to no sugar in my tea . I actually like bitter black tea . This chai by stash is n't bitter so much as just plsin bad . I love chai and used to order loose leaf ( at a high price ) from a place online that does n't have it anymore . I guess you get what you pay for . This tea has a terrible after taste i ca n't begin to describe . Like dirt or sour cinnamon . I like both cinnamon and cloves so i 'm not sure my complaint is the same as other reviewers . It really tastes like old bitter , sour , cheap spices to me ! Glad i got this on sale at the store rather than wasted money ordering here . This box willbe going to work , annonously so no one knows it 's from me ! Or perhaps i should just throw it out . Do n't like to be wasteful but I ca n't bear the thought of drinking a whole box of this !	-1
I 'm really curious as to what `` blended black tea '' , means . It does n't say it on the ingredients list , but it smells and tastes just like menthol , camphor and eucalyptus oil , with a nice blend of cinnamon , which it does list . In removing it from the wrapper , it had such a strong aroma of Vick 's Vapor Rub , that it gave me second thoughts as to whether it was safe to drink . However , I did want to try it , so here I am , alive and still kicking . The only positive thing I can say is that it has a nice cinnamon flavor that pleasantly lingers in my mouth , and the packaging is easy on the eyes . Not sure what the manufacturers were thinking though , in putting this product out in the public arena as a beverage . The ingredients are : blended black tea , ginger root , cinnamon , cinnamon oil , clove oil , allspice , nutemeg , clove , and cardamon oil . Because of the unknown element , I would n't be surprised if they started marketing it , as a familiar cold remedy . Todd Wilbur ? ... you missed one .	-1
I bought this because I thought it actually had organic ingredients- as the description stated . It does not . It 's quite good Chai tea , but I 'd rather drink organic Allegro chai tea ( available at Whole Foods for close to this price ) than buy this stuff . The good news is that unlike some teas on Amazon , this one is very fresh and has a good sell-by date . I ordered it only a few weeks ago , and it is good until 11/2012 . So if you do n't care about organic tea , and you want a nice chai with strong cinnamon overtones , this is a pretty good one . I really like Allegro chai- it tastes more balanced to me , and I was hoping the Stash would be like that , but it 's not .	-1
Not familiar with what `` chai '' tea is supposed to taste like but this tea tasted like stewed cloves to me Yuck.Got this flavor in a sampler box and , so far , it 's the only Stash tea I 've tried and disliked strongly . Some are better than others , of course , but I find this particular flavor really , really unpleasant , which is odd given my love for most of the spices listed on label . The problem is that the clove just overwhelms everything and that 's about all I could taste , outside a touch of cinnamon . IMO , clove has much too strong a taste to be used beyond sparingly ... in anything . Perhaps adding milk and sugar might 've made it more palatable - might even be the way it 's 'supposed ' to be prepared , but one of the reasons I drink tea is to stay away from having to add sweeteners or milk to make it taste good . In any case , I ca n't imagine using enough milk/sweetener to subdue the overwhelming clove taste would leave any room in the mug for tea or water .	-1
I enjoy many types of tea , the more flavorful the better . I received this in a sampler that I purchased and did not find it to be very good . It has a very oily taste to it . I will finish off the tea bags that came in the box but would not purchase this type again .	-1
I realize that taste in tea , and particularly green tea is a matter of personal preference . For me , I found this tea to be unpleasant . Opening the tea bag , I detected an aroma reminiscent of lawn clippings . As I drank the tea , I find the unpleasant aroma becomes an unpleasant taste . I am not sure how to describe it . . . perhaps wet lawn clippings or even a mossy taste . I do not get the sharp `` bite '' I normally expect from a good green tea.I will try this for a week , and see if I am missing something , but as for now , I can not recommend purchasing this tea .	-1
I WANTED to love this tea -- It was SAD . I gave it away . On the other hand , I ADORE the Harney & Sons Chocolate Mint loose tea - it is FABULOUS ! ! ! !	-1
Not sure why this Stash Choco Hazlenut tasted so different then when I have purchased it in the past . I was really disappointed in the amount of tea leaves in each bag . Just was n't the same Stash I 've purchased in the stores . It almost seemed like it was old or stale . Really bummed to because I was looking on buying this over and over again from this vendor .	-1
Their Earl Grey and English breakfast do not come close to the quality of Twining teas.Very disappointing . Poor quality . Lousy flavor .	-1
This is the only herbal or decaf tea I have ever had that has soy . I am alergic to soy and am now stuck with 5 boxes of tea I ca n't use .	-1
I bought this from my local market . My husband liked it . I happened to notice this morning when looking at the tea bag wrapper , it containted PEANUTS ! No mention of that allergen was listed on the outside of the box . I fired off an email to Stash already . It seems Amazon got it listed correctly . All of my tea has now been trashed.Watch out since Stash does not seem to label the outside of their boxes .	-1
First I wish Amazon would separate the reviews for Stash teas based on flavors rather than lumping them all together . I have the Stash Chocolate Mint Oolong tea and I really like that , so I figured I would also try this so I could have a decaf chocolate tea as well . I ended up giving the rest of this away because the artificial smell and taste got to me . Normally I love hazelnut and figured chocolate hazelnut would be even better . I suggest when you read the reviews on here that you check to see which flavor tea is being reviewed so that you are n't mislead .	-1
I threw it away . It tasted bad . It was bitter and tasted wierd . Maybe I got a bad batch or something .	-1
It tastes mildly of chocolate with the addition of stevia in it . The problem though is the dental hygienist pointed out at my last cleaning that my teeth are getting unusually stained from something new I 'm eating or drinking . I mentioned purchasing a ton of this tea from Amazon and she was pretty sure that was the source since I do n't normally have this issue . As a result , I 've mostly quit drinking it .	-1
This tea just is n't for me -- I thought it was a little gross . It did n't seem to taste like chocolate OR hazelnuts.I do n't really think it had much taste at all , really . Pretty disappointing . I did n't add any sugar to it , so perhaps the flavor would change a little with some sweetness ?	-1
I am a chocolate fanatic and pairing chocolate with tea only seems natural to me . I 've sampled several chocolate flavors and this Stash tea , when compared to the others , is nothing spectacular . When unbrewed , the Stash tea bag smells like chocolate but that scent does not translate to much of a chocolate flavor once the tea is brewed . I could taste quite a bit of vanilla and some nut but the chocolate was just negligible . Additionally , there was a strange aftertaste with this tea . It just was n't pleasant.If you are committed to a chocolate decaffeinated beverage , your choices will be limited . I have sampled quite a few chocolate teas and many use a black tea base . However , if interested in a caffeine free tee that has a good body , I would recommendChocolate Chai Tea by Zhena 's Gypsy Tea , which is a naturally caffeine free tea . Zhena 's chocolate chai is supposed to taste like chocolate , but it has a lot of spices . Still , Chocolate Chai Tea by Zhena 's Gypsy Teahas a much richer overall flavor than the Stash Premium Chocolate Hazelnut tea.If you do n't care about caffeine and are just looking for a chocolate tea , there are several others that I would recommend before this one . They include : Tisano Organic Chocolate Tea , SerendipiTea ChocolaTea , Chocolate , Vanilla , Rooibos & Black Tea , 4-Ounce Boxes ( Pack of 2 ) , andBigelow White Chocolate ObsessionTea , 1.6-Ounce Boxes ( Pack of 6 ) . The first two are loose teas and the last is a bagged tea.At the end of the day , I do n't think I would recommend this Stash tea to any chocolate lover . It does n't taste like chocolate and the overall flavor is poor .	-1
As someone who loves Japanese-style green tea , I highly recommend Stash 's regular green tea . That 's why I ordered their green decaf . However , this decaf does not have the same qualities as their regular green tea . The tea is not green in color -- it is more of a brownish color -- and it does n't have that fresh `` green '' taste I enjoy with their caffeinated version . Maybe green tea just does n't keep its color or flavor when it is decaffeinated . It 's not too bad though , and I 'll have to keep trying it to see if it grows on me . I actually have not found the perfect green decaf yet.PS : After a long period of thinking I did n't like it , then going back to try it again , it may not be as bad as I first thought . Most green decafs disappoint , so do n't consider any green decafs as having true green tea flavor . Stash 's is n't objectionable like some , it 's just bland . It 's a bit better than most green decafs , but not nearly as good as good Japanese caffeinated green tea . For true green tea taste , try a Japanese Sencha or Macha caffeinated tea , like Kirkland 's Signature Macha or Yamamotoyama teas . I very much DISlike the Stash Organic Premium Decaf Green however , and urge you not to buy it . I have a concern about the levels of fluoride in green teas ( especially Chinese teas , so I 've read ) , but I suppose if consumed in moderation , like everything else , the risks should n't be of great concern , and the benefits probably outweigh them .	-1
I honestly do n't know how this item is allowed on store shelves ! It 's THAT BAD ! I was having trouble locating my favorite vanilla nut tea from another tea company and in its absence decided to try Stash 's . I can not even express how 'chemical ' and unnatural it smelled and tasted ! I had to throw it out ! Will never purchase Stash again.Disregard the 1 star rating ... I would give it 'zero ' if I could !	-1
Had a craving out of the blue . Felt & tasted like I was chewing Slim Jim flavored paper . Even after I peeled the casing , it chewed down to what seemed like a wad of paper . I do n't remember this happening in the long ago past .	-1
I used to like Slim Jims way back in the day , so I was glad to get these from Amazon . But I 'm very disappointed . I 'm not sure if this is how they 're supposed to taste , but they 're very strange and unpleasant.I noticed that these do n't say they contain pork , but they do contain `` mechanically separated chicken . '' They also contain textured soy protein and corn syrup . Gluten-sensitive people should be aware these contain wheat flour . Since the packaging does n't advertise that they are anything but a `` smoked snack stick , '' and that description only occurs in fine print above the ingredient list , I 'm going to guess these are n't aimed for people who care about niceties like `` meat-looking snacks actually being composed of meat . '' At 140 calories , 3 carbs , and 480mg of sodium per stick , they are n't too bad in my opinion for the size of snack you get in the package . And on the plus side , they are quite filling.But that 's about the only good quality these things have . Their casings are fibrous and almost papery , and toward the bottom the sticks are coated in a strange slick reddish oily liquid . The stuff inside the casing is an odd texture and even more odd scent -- dry and oily and redolent of smoke flavoring and spices . They taste dry and powdery and yet soaked in oil and binders . They knock you off your butt with cloying smokiness , and there are weird bits of gristle all through it -- some chunks so big I could n't eat them . Every bite chewed down to a cardboard-y feel . The flavor lingered in my mouth long after eating the stick and my husband , a vegetarian who normally does n't mind at all if I cook or eat meat around him , said he was overwhelmed with the stench of the stuff on my breath even after I brushed my teeth and flossed ( which was actually a necessity as the sticks ' fibrous contents had gotten stuck in my teeth ) .I can not imagine anybody wanting to purchase these and can not imagine them as a valid snack food . The only way I could eat them is if I were starving hungry and/or drunk . I can actually see these going well with cheap beer . But otherwise , I 'm certainly never buying any.I do n't think they were anywhere near this bad in my youth . I ca n't even imagine what happened to Slim Jims in the last 20 years , but I 'm sorry to see a cherished snack from my childhood destroyed this way .	-1
I am on the subscription service for the Slim Jim pack of 100 . My most current order does not contain the same product . The box I received a few days ago has PORK in it , which is NOT mentioned in the product description . But the ingredient of pork is clearly stated on the outside of the box , along with beef and chicken . Also , the sticks are soggy and limp ... no snap like the previous order . I 'm cancelling my subscribe & save option on this item .	-1
I love beef . I love honey . I love barbecue sauce . I found this flavor so revolting , I could not even gag one bite down.Something has gone drastically wrong here .	-1
I 've consumed products of this nature most of my life , but these just fell far short of being any good . To put it bluntly , they 're just too greasy and chewy . There are many products of this nature in the same price range that are of far higher quality , so there 's really no excuse for making something this poorly.Right out of the bag , they were very greasy to the touch , and left an orange grease on my fingers . The casing and filling seem like wet paper with seasoning , and the filling appeared to be the cheapest `` meat '' you could pull from an animal and still call it meat . I 've eaten beef sticks in this same price range that are clearly beef , with much better texture and consistency.These sticks also contain mechanically-separated chicken , which is a pretty disgusting product I try to avoid . Watch some being made sometime , and you 'll never eat it again.If you like greasy , spicy meat-stuff in a chewy , paper-like casing , you 'll like these . If you would like a bit of quality and texture in a beef stick , look elsewhere . If I had to describe these with one word , it would be 'nasty . '	-1
I am a regular consumer of Slim Jim products - at least twice a week , I buy one from the counter at the cafe in my office building . But these Slim Jims from Amazon did n't taste right - I do n't know if it was a combination of the exceedingly hot weather and these Slim Jims traveling some distance on the back of a hot truck to be delivered to me , but I eagerly tore open the package , took one bite , could n't even swallow it , and ended up throwing the entire Slim Jim in the trash after I tried a second bite , just to make sure my mind was n't playing tricks on me . It tasted horrible . So I 'm not sure what 's up , because like I said , these are products I eat regularly - I 'm not some health food nut vegan who just ordered a product so I could condemn it , and then lecture everyone else about the evils of eating meat . I like meat , and I like Slim Jims . But I did n't like the taste of these ...	-1
The Slim Jim meat is very bad . The meat is dry and the taste of the meat is bad . I do not like this meat . The sticks are useful . I like meat in a stick .	-1
I found this oddly fibrous and inedible . It was almost like there was paper or rubber in my mouth as I chewed on this . At first I thought it was just that stick , so I opened another one and it was exactly the same !	-1
These things will burn off your tongue and throat . You can not even eat half the bag in one sitting . Even worse , they are very salty , so if you suffer from high blood pressure do not buy this item ! ! !	-1
The licorice tea was not for me , and the fruit flavored ones tasted too bland.I do love their Apple Cider tea , especially in the colder months .	-1
I hate licorice flavor . Half the teas in this pack include licorice powder in them , which ruins it for me . Why would you add it to the otherwise lovely , fruity flavors of blueberry , mango or raspberry tea ? I 'm surprised others find these teas to be weak . As one reviewer pointed out , maybe they were diluting it with too much water . I love ginger in cooking , and I even like eating pieces of it in dried form . But in a tea , you expect a hint of it 's flavor , not the full strength of the spice . The ginger tea was just too overpowering to the point of being unpleasant . Although I like the other teas in this box without licorice flavoring , I would not bother buying this sampler box again to get them .	-1
A sampler box is a good idea when it comes to tea . However , this selection includes some strange flavors , including licorice which can be found in many of the types the box offers . If that is not your cup of tea ( no pun intended ) , a third of the box will be useless for you . The bags are of poor quality too . They fall apart much of the time : (	-1
The pretzels are tasty and convenient , but I ca n't give them a higher rating due to the extreme jump in price ( nearly double the price it was a couple of weeks ago when I made the purchase-around $ 17 ) . Due to this , I assume the previous great reviews are based on the former price . Now I can pick these up at my local Grocery for close to the same price per bag , which defeats the purchase of buying in bulk online .	-1
I purchased the High Protein Pretzels . I 've had Newman 's Own Organic Pretzels before and they tasted great - but these are not good at all . 95 % of the salt is at the bottom of the bag ( have to have salt on pretzels ! ) and they have an overwhelming flavor of being burnt and not a good burnt either ! I have no use now for all these pretzels and i ca n't imagine anyone enjoying this taste ! It is upsetting to see that a few others also ended up with the High Protein pretzels having this awful BURNT flavor and yet they still kept sending them out . I 'd think maybe they 'd look at batch numbers or something to prevent them from being shipped out to dissatisfied customers who will give it a bad review.Generally Newman 's Pretzels are really good , but buy these at your own risk ... .	-1
This review is for : Newman 's Own Organics Pretzels , Salted Sticks , 8-Ounce Bags ( Pack of 12 ) ( Grocery ) If it 's not the & # 34 ; U & # 34 ; with a circle around it , then it 's the & # 34 ; D & # 34 ; ( dumb ) , & # 34 ; M & # 34 ; ( moronic & # 34 ; or & # 34 ; K & # 34 ; ( kryptonite ) that 's found on so many processed foods these days . Nobody not affiliated with a certain religion needs to pay a tax for a commodity that has nothing to do with that religion , but when you find a & # 34 ; U & # 34 ; or a & # 34 ; K & # 34 ; on the packaging , it spells T-A-X , and an involuntary one at that . Let the people who belong to this non-universal , tribal religion fork out the money . Shame on Newman 's Own for making the majority of consumers pay for the ideology of the few . There is no health benefit from this sort of sectarian labeling , do n't kid yourself.These sticks are tasty and satisfying , but all their taste fades away when I see the & # 34 ; U & # 34 ; on the back of the packaging , and I realize the consumer is being unfairly and involuntarily tricked into paying for something that has conveys no health benefit whatsoever . That really puts a bad taste in my mouth . ***This product also contains soy . Tsk , tsp , tsk . No wonder it 's & # 34 ; kosher. & # 34 ; GMO soy kills.Check out the website double you double you double you dot checkthelabel dot org dot uk	-1
The Spelt product listing States it is wheat free.The box of product received today states Contains : Wheat , and , Manufactured on equipment that processes products containing wheat.The bag artwork does n't match the Amazon product photo.Those of us with wheat allergies are not happy with this product.Photo ( s ) posted .	-1
These might be OK for hi-protein pretzels but they are not so good as pretzels , period . In addition , the bags I received will expire in less than 3 months . I am not pleased .	-1
I bought it to make ice cream . I have n't try it yet ( the beans are vacuum-sealed ) , however , the picture is misleading , the beans are moist and about half the circumference of a yellow # 2 pencil . A little disappointing looking , but who knows , it may be a great buy .	-1
I do n't know if the Newmans had their friends come on here and write glowing reviews or something , but I 'm amazed people are raving about this awful popcorn.The problem is the palm oil . I am never buying anything with palm oil again because of this popcorn , it is disgusting . Its not only solid at room temperature , butwhen I heated one of the bags partially up to try to clean the oil off the kernels so I could pop them with some regular oil.. I could n't even get the blasted stuffoff of the bowl I had it in , with warm soap and water ... .So I looked this frankenoil up , it 's 85 percent saturated fat , why the Newsmans Own company would choose this hard solidified oil instead of some regular oil is beyond me.. maybethe organic version of corn oil is too expensive ... maybe theyre trying to keep it from leaking during storage by having this solid mass.. I dont know..But do n't waste your money , if you have any palate at all you wont like this , the mouth feel is tacky and waxy plus an unpleasant taste to the palm oil , which like others said solidifies onthe popcorn and gives this granularish greasy waxy feel . Not good at all . If youre the type that cant tell the difference between margarine and butter or real whipped cream and cool whip..you might not mind this stuff . But for something this saturated , may as well use real butter.Im stuck with about 8 more boxes I 'm having to heat and get the oil off the kernels.. what a blast .	-1
We 'd ordered this popcorn once via Amazon , and my entire family was amazed that an organic microwaveable popcorn was so good . The next time I ordered , though , the popcorn was a major disappointment . It smelled _bad_ while cooking , and the taste was very unpleasant ... not just a strange greasy flavor , but absolutely no butter-flavor to it , either .	-1
I 'm a fan of just about all Newman 's Own products , so when I caught a sale on this popcorn ( 36 bags for & lt ; $ 12 ) - even though I 'd never tried it , I assumed it would be delicious . Wrong . This popcorn is completely flavorless , which I could actually tolerate by adding my own butter and extra salt - if not for the unpopped kernels in every single bite . Not such a great deal for me afterall .	-1
This popcorn is rather bland . I purchased it because generally I like Newman 's own brand and I liked the idea of Organic popcorn but it is flavorless . I would not buy again .	-1
Last summer Amazon carried another organic brand that was superior to this one . Although Belle ( commenter ) does n't agree , it is bland tasting and chewy . Maybe I just got a bad case , but I wo n't be buyng this again.I do love other Newman organic products , just not this one .	-1
This product tastes great ! But not without a price . : - ( I reviewed the label and even though it advertises itself as `` no butter '' , the popcorn still uses plenty of other oils . Like palm oil which is an all-natural ingredient , but also one of nature 's fattiest substances . It 's not as unhealthy as butter , but it 's still pretty bad ( especially if you 're like me and eat 5 servings ( the whole bag ) in just one sitting ) .Alternatives : - Orville Redenbacher 's `` Light Natural '' is a better alternative , offering a pleasant taste but with just half as many calories , half the fat , and approximately the same amount of sodium.- Bearito 's No Salt/No Oil and Healthy Choice Popcorn are other alternatives , although I do n't think they taste as good as Redenbacher 's `` Light Natural '' brand . ( Bearito 's and HC Popcorn are also much more expensive ; almost twice the price . ) I wo n't be buying anymore of Newman 's brand , but I 'll definitely be buying more of the alternatives listed above . : - )	-1
Rarely has a product offended my taste buds as much as this bar did . I'n definitely not going to stock up on these bars .	-1
I have not tried a lot of these types of bars to compare , but I did not like this one . It is very chewy and it might be filling too if you can finish it before you get tired of chewing it . I tried to eat these on several occasions and I noticed they also seem to give me a headache and just a general bad feeling .	-1
I was under the impression I was getting a box of 15 bars at least there was nothing otherwise that would indicate something less . I received one bar on a hot Saturday afternoon delivered by the Post office . The bar was soft and we had to refrigerate it for several minutes before we could taste it . The first taste was enough to appreciate the fact we only received one bar of the Think This Chocolate Fudge Bar . There is a slightly bitter taste plus there is a lingering dryness that will take a while to disappear . While the bar touts only 20g of protein and zero sugar , I think we will opt for a High Protein Bar that has more flavor and less of the after lingering effects . I just ate a Hershey bar and now the original taste is gone . By doing so I messed up terribly the sugar and protein count for today.The bar states that the mission of thinkThin is to positivity impact the lives and wellness of others and to lead in changing the endemic destruction of weight and poor nutrition related diseases in our country . I am afraid the maker has gotten somewhat carried away in his/her ambitious mission statement . I may never buy a protein bar again . Sorry ! I do agree that you would probably lose weight since after the first bite I wanted nothing else to eat.By the way the bar does not hold up to the very hot heat outside here in Texas however In have to fault the Post office for part of this since the delivery was made in the late afternoon thus that little bar has been on that truck all day .	-1
As others have posted , this bar is not anywhere near anything I would ever eat again . While I use protein bars to supplement my appetite throughout a day , this one was as tasteless as I 've come across . Bland , blah and borderline nasty .	-1
ThinkThin Chocolate Fudge Gluten Free bars may very well be the worse bar that I have ever tasted . Think of everything that the words `` chocolate fudge '' create in your mind . This is none of those . It has a very strange texture as well . Total pass !	-1
This is a chalky , dry tasting sweet that tastes like it is gluten-free and delicious-free . I got only one of them , but I did save the box which I will find great use for , I 'm sure.I wish I had ordered the peanut butter . No I do n't plan on buying anymore , and I will not think thin anymore either .	-1
I 've had quite a few of these bars in my bag as I travel - the Clif Protein bars are the top , with a couple of the Atkins varieties slightly below , and this one near the very bottom . They 're sold under the auspices of healthy - that halo effect from the `` gluten free , '' but they 're really just a not very good candy bar.Pros : - No sugar , so if you 're low carb they 'll work- Um , they 're larger than some of the teeny tiny bars , so that 's good.Cons : - They taste pretty terrible . Flavors of wet cardboard , stale beer , and old cigarette butts meld with that something you 'll find on the floor at a fraternity house.- They 're not good for you . Just eat a candy bar instead , seriously .	-1
So this is chocolate and fudge . I tried it after a day at work , to 'relax ' and hold me over until i got home . Close , but no cigar.Chocolate taste on the coating is minimal , though melts with finger heat just like the real thing . Body is crumbly , heavy and bland . I noticed a full , but backgroundish chemical taste ( not oder ) . There was little feel or taste for a chocolate fudge energy bar.Yes , it 's edible . Recommended ? I 'll leave that to individual tastes in case you buy it .	-1
These are OK. Not the best kind of protein ( soy is inadequate to whey or other types ) and not a whole bunch of it . They taste good , but I have found better tasting bars for around 200 calories . Not the highest quality ingredients either . For this type of bar ( meal replacement ) , I would recommend a Clif bar . It tastes better , has higher quality ingredients , and leaves you feeling much fuller for a much longer period of time .	-1
These Thin bars are unfortunately pretty much what you would expect from something like this . Small , flavorless for the most part , or at least carrying an off flavor , and only satisfying in the sense that you know its better for you than a Twinkie . I really did n't get any real chocolate fudge flavor out of these at all . They really do n't taste bad , just not satisfying or all that pleasant . They do the trick as far as having something in your tummy and putting off hunger pangs for a little while , but that 's about it . One thing I did like about them is the chewy texture . It was rather gummy to me in that sense which is something you either like in these things or not . I do for it gives you the sense of this small bar lasting a little longer ... My biggest gripe with these is the cost . None of these protein/diet type bars are cheap , but these are definitely on the high end for sure . And there is no flavor there to account for the bigger bucks . You can do better here as far as taste , and price . The specs on these are pretty good for those that are really trying to lose weight or snack healthier , but I see no reason to recommend them otherwise ...	-1
The only word appropriate for describing this product is gross . I eat a lot of protein bars , my favorite being Quest bars . I tend to steer clear of protein bars that have that artificial/chemical flavor and unfortunately these fall into that category for me . Some flavors are better than others and although this was one of the less offensive flavors ( hence the two stars ) , it 's still not a product I 'd ever buy again.These have that typical `` protein bar '' texture that 's a bit difficult to explain ... it 's somewhat dry and crumbly and almost seems to dissolve in your mouth as you chew , and the flavor was sickeningly sweet in a very artificial way . Everything about this bar just tasted so unnatural and I 've come to expect more from protein products at this price point.Overall I found this bar to be awful and can not recommend this product .	-1
This review is for the Chocolate Fudge flavor of the Think Thin Bars . In a word , yuck . This bar may be all kinds of nutritious , but you have to want to eat it for that to take any effect.The taste and texture was kind of like eating cocoa powder dusted Styrofoam . It was kind of chewy and soft all at the same time and the only flavor , aside from a dry flat taste , was the cocoa powder . And it was more like a milk chocolate for the cocoa powder as it had that kind of sour aftertaste . Needless to say , I did n't enjoy it.The ingredients are decent . The following is the ingredients list copied from Think Thin 's website : PROTEIN BLEND ( WHEY PROTEIN ISOLATE , SOY PROTEIN ISOLATE , CALCIUM CASEINATE , CASEIN ) GLYCERIN , MALTITOL , COATING ( MALTITOL , COCOA BUTTER , CHOCOLATE , SODIUM CASEINATE , MILK FAT , SOY LECITHIN , NATURAL FLAVORS , SALT ) , ALMONDS , WATER , CANOLA OIL , CHOCOLATE , ALKALIZED COCOA , SOY LECITHIN , NATURAL FLAVORS , SEA SALT.You would think since it was real chocolate and cocoa butter that it would have been a bit better tasting , but all I can think is that perhaps they used low grade chocolate . And I was really surprised to see almonds listed in there , I did n't taste them at all . And using Maltitol for the sweetener , I would have preferred stevia or even just a tiny bit of cane sugar ( yes I realize part of this products boast is having 0 grams of sugar , but a tiny bit would n't hurt ) . Still , for a protein bar this is n't a bad list in comparison to other brands.This product is certified to be gluten free and it is sugar free unlike many bars out there . So it is unique in that aspect and good for those on special diets . There 's 240 calories per bar , but this is meant to be a meal replacement or training snack , not a regular snack . 8 grams of fat and 1 gram of fiber are in it along with 20 grams of protein , which is a lot . And while there is no sugar , sugar alcohol is present as 12 grams of this bar.I would n't buy these again . At least not in this flavor . Perhaps some of the others are a little better tasting . But I could n't even finish this bar I thought it tasted so bad , and I 'm not normally one to waste food . But , perhaps with different taste buds , someone could enjoy this enough to reap its nutritional benefits.Review by M. Reynard 2013	-1
I have tried other `` healthy '' chocolate bars , but I would not recommend this one . Many `` healthy '' bars , although they are not as good as candy bars , of course , have some taste appeal . But there was little taste to this bar . It did , however , taste very artificial . The outer cocoa layer was somewhat bitter , too . When I looked at the nutritional facts , I found that it was not that healthy either . The calories amounted to 240 , 70 of which were from fat . For comparison 's sake , a regular old Milky Way bar of about the same size contains 240 calories , 80 of which are from fat . The sodium for this bar was 190 mg . The Milky Way contains only 75mg of sodium ! The only thing that I thought was any good about this bar was that it was made without gluten . Because this bar neither tastes good nor is healthy , I would not recommend it .	-1
The thinkThin chocolate fudge protein bar is a very underwhelming protein bar . Boasting 20g of protein , the bar also has 8g of fat , 3 of which are saturated , with 240 calories . For that , you might as well have a Luna Protein Bar , which is chocolatey , hearty , hefty , filling , and extremely tasty . This bar is none of those things.The initial bite is reminiscent of a lackluster Three Musketeers bar . The chocolate has a chalky , Play D'oh taste to it . Another bite , you notice the slightly meaty flavor of the protein ( this is a problem from which most high protein bars suffer ) . More bites ... I honestly ca n't say . It 's taken me almost a week to eat the whole thing . It does n't feel substantial , yet you definitely are n't in the mood for more after a bite or two.Bottom line : you want a lot of protein and you do n't care what it tastes like , go for it . If taste and consistency are concerns , look elsewhere ( like the Luna Protein bars ) .	-1
Just make sure this is your only food source , and i guarantee you 'll start dropping pounds . Starvation is a more tempting option than letting these pass your lips.Because i 'm a slow learner , i 've tried two different flavors : chocolate fudge and chocolate covered strawberry . In both cases , for the first half second or so , i thought they might be decent . The first flicker of flavor is unoffensive . But then that vanishes and something dreadful replaces it . I ca n't even describe it.There 's nothing redeeming in the texture either , something along the lines of fluffy damp sawdust.And lest you think i have a problem with all high-protein meal bars , i assure you , i 'm a lazy person and often end up eating zing or clif or builder bars instead of tracking down an actual meal . Some are good , some are decent , some are not so good , but they 're all better than these .	-1
I have tried my fair share of protein bars and they all seem to taste like powdery chalk . This high protein bar by Think Thin is not an exception . The flavor is chocolate fudge and while there is an element of chocolate it is mired with a bitter aftertaste that is prelude by powdery chalk aspect that haunts my palate . This protein bar is designed to be a meal replacement , hence the calorie count of 240 and a total fat count of 8 grams . I would imagine that if a person is willing to sacrifice the calories and fat , this meal replacement bar should taste better . In addition , this protein bar has cholesterol in it , which I found quite disappointing . There is no sugar or trans fat in this bar but cholesterol ? I believe I will continue using homemade smoothies as my meal replacement .	-1
As others have already stated in their reviews , the bar is loaded with 20g protein and it is a quick fix to curb the appetite , but the taste and texture is pretty poor . Dry but chewy texture , feels like an old fudge bar with chalk or dust in it.If you like this kind of thing then you 'll like it I suppose .	-1
I have had dozens of `` thinkThin '' gluten-free bars over the last few years . If you ask fitness experts like Tom Venuto , you are buying a candy bar with vitamins and protein thrown in it . However , I 've enjoyed supplementing my meals with this nutritious energy boost for some time . Having a gluten-free diet , I am pleased to report that all the varieties I 've tried are tasty and filling enough before or after a workout . ( And , anyone who has `` Celiac 's Disease '' like I do will vouch for the fact that any designated gluten-free product not tasting like sawdust is usually worth our time and money . Right ? ) You can get these bars at several grocery stores , and , depending on the purveyor , this product is reasonably priced at about $ 1.50 . There are 20 grams of protein , and if you have a cross-intolerance to dairy , then , I believe , `` white chocolate '' should be your ideal choice.When this nutritional , meal supplement arrived , I ate it the first day . `` Chocolate Espresso '' is my favorite flavor , but the item I got was stale . Instead of it being rich and chewy , it was chalky and crumbly.Do n't get me wrong , I love Amazon . They are my favorite retailer . It 's just that it seems to me the shelf life is most likely shorter at the grocery store or at Wal-Mart than it is from Amazon . I do n't know if something needs to be improved from `` thinkThin '' to Amazon or from Amazon to the consumer , but a change needs to happen ( hopefully ) soon , for the benefit of consumers and pureveyors .	-1
The bar had many nutritional pluses . Sadly it lacked [ at least for me ] the one thing I require - taste . I also thought the texture was undesirable . I wo n't be buying any more .	-1
I like the flavor , but these will break your teeth ! I have taken to dipping them in hot coffee to soften them enough to chew , but I wo n't be ordering more .	-1
The positives of this product is that it is gluten free , sugar free and has a reasonable amount of protein , but being pretty much flavor free , these are not enough for me to recommend it . The first bite was a bit dry but OK with a subtext of coffee flavor . Sadly , the experience deteriorated from there . I was unable to discern any espresso flavor in subsequent bites and if blindfolded would have been hard pressed to taste anything in the way of chocolate . Definitely something that needs a large glass of water to help it along . Few energy bars offer little more than the promise that they can , with any semblance of satisfaction , replace real food .	-1
The texture was crumbly and dry . The flavor tasted like a weak cup of espresso with no sweetener and a little cocoa powder . I was n't impressed and will not purchase these in the future . The only redeeming quality is that they are somewhat good for you .	-1
I tried a thinkThin Chocolate Espresso bar , and it 's an OK , gluten free protein bar , but it 's not for me . They have a decent chocolate taste with some espresso notes , but the texture is dry and chalky , and there 's a definite sweetener aftertaste.Despite the `` thinkThin '' brand name , this is basically a protein bar , with 230 calories , 20 grams protein , 8 grams of fat , and 25 grams carbs , including 10 grams sugar alcohol . Each bar also has about 20 grams of caffeine.All in all , if you 're looking for a gluten free protein bar , I think this would be worth a try , but if not , I think there are better choices .	-1
This bar has the makings of a good protein bar . 0 grams of sugar and 20 grams of protein are a solid start . It was just the chalky , strange taste and the unpleasant dry texture that sealed the deal for me . I definitely will not be placing an order for a box of these . If you are still willing to try them out because the ingredient list suits your needs , I would suggest starting with one bar and not a whole box .	-1
Yuck . This bar tastes like chalk and non-food bulk with the slightest hint of chemical-laden chocolate . There 's no way I could get all the way through this thing . In the event that you are able to eat the whole thing I 'm sure it 's quite filling , as it 's a very heavy , dense bar . That said , I think the box it came in had better texture and flavor than this thing . This is only `` food '' in the loosest possible sense of the term .	-1
Yuck ! This has GOT to be the worse tasting bar I have ever eaten . It tastes like you are chocking down a bunch of chemicals . Yes , yes I KNOW it says `` all natural '' but really it 's gross . I looked up the ingredient list ( the ingredient list IS on the back of the bar but on my bar Amazon stuck a sticker right on top of it ) and it maybe a form of natural ingredients or maybe what USE TO BE natural ingredients but it 's not anymore.Also if you are really looking to avoid products such as MSG , and GMOs this bar is n't for you . Soy , and Canola are both now primarily GMO unless it 's organic . If you are n't familiar with GMOs it 's a good time to learn about them and decide for yourself if it 's something you want to consume . I 'm not here to tell you one way or another but I 've made the decision to avoid it as much as possible.And regarding `` Natural Flavors '' . What I have heard is `` Natural Flavors '' is industry term ingredients which can contain MSG and / or Aspartame.Just doing a bit of research on the ingredient list of this bar , I ca n't see how Think Thin can get away with calling itself `` All Natural '' . It really should be called `` Deprived from Natural Ingredients '' or `` What was once natural ingredients but now is in a unrecognizable form '' .INGREDIENTS : PROTEIN BLEND ( WHEY PROTEIN ISOLATE , SOY PROTEIN ISOLATE , CALCIUM CASEINATE , CASEIN ) , GLYCERIN , COATING ( MALTITOL , COCOA BUTTER , CHOCOLATE , SODIUM CASEINATE , MILK FAT , SOY LECITHIN , NATURAL FLAVORS , SALT ) , MALTITOL , ALKALIZED COCOA , COCOA SOY CRISPS ( SOY PROTEIN ISOLATE , ALKALIZED COCOA , TAPIOCA STARCH ) , PEANUTS , WATER , CANOLA OIL , NATURAL FLAVORS , SOY LECITHIN , COFFEE.CONTAINS : MILK , PEANUTS , SOY.MANUFACTURED IN A PLANT THAT ALSO PROCESSES EGGS AND TREE NUTS.GLUTEN FREE Certified Gluten Free by GFCO , gfco.orgMaltitol is a sugar alcohol and is artificially produced ( according to various sources ) .Sodium caseinate is the biochemical name for casein . Casein is the name for a family of related phosphoproteins . These proteins are commonly found in milk.For 230 calories a bar and 20 grams of protein I think a person could do better for their body and have something tastier to eat . Perhaps a few eggs ?	-1

I tend to steer clear of protein bars that have that artificial/chemical flavor and unfortunately these fall into that category for me .

For a healthy snack , the thinkThin Chocolate Espresso is not what I expected . I 've eaten a few types of popular nutrition bars before , and they are either the really fruity-soft kind or the really nutty-hard kind , none have been like this -- - the soft-but-hard kind . Let me explain , the thinkThin is a 2/3 '' thick piece of chocolate bar formed with expresso inside , it 's a very dense heavy chunk mushed together . And while you 're suppose to 'think thin ' , the bar gives the opposite impression ! And after taking several bites , you certainly dont feel thin , it 's a very clunky taste , sort of soft but dry and hard paste that does n't even have a very good flavor . Feels sort of like eating cardboard if cardboard had an edible texture ! And you will need a drink to wash down your healthy bar ! I do taste the expresso , not really the chocolate cause it 's just a mess of flavors and none really stand out . It sure tastes healthy , if healthy means it has no [ good ] taste and we all know , healthy is something most people do n't enjoy eating but only because they have to ! `` High Protein . Low glycemic . Sugar free , Wheat free . Gluten free . 0g trans fat . All natural . 20g of protein . 2g effective carbs . Best taste . No ingredients produced using biotechnology- wow , if this is what biotech does to food , NO THANK YOU ! Please take technology out of the process ... machines do not have tastebuds , that 's why this thinkThin bar has ZERO taste . Definitely no sugar , which is why it 's like eating cardboard , which also does n't have sugar but lots of protein ! ; ) '' Delicious wholesome weight management '' - because after you eat this , you 'll not want to eat anymore since it ruins your tongue/appetite.Not recommended . Yikes . Worst tasting health bar ever , think I 'll go back to fruits and nuts , thinkThin has someone managed to destroy chocolate and expresso ; (	-1
I have tried this bar numerous times and I do not like it . It 's like eating cardboard .	-1
This review is based on a single bar provided by the Amazon Vine program.I eat a lot of `` bars '' from protein bars , to snack bars . This bar is small , but packs 230 calories , 20 grams of protein , no sugar , and 25 grams of carbs . The chocolate covering had good flavor , and consistency . It was n't too waxy or melty . The interior is a single mass of dry filling . It had a vague chocolately espresso taste , but was n't good . It was also very dry.If you need gluten free , it may be an ok option , but I 'll be looking elsewhere .	-1
I ate one and threw the rest away . That should sum up how I feel about these supposed `` ThinkThin '' candy bars . They are definitely not Nutrition bars as they do not contain anything close to nutritious . I get snack attacks and am always looking for something healthy to munch on other than fruit . So far the only bars that I have found to be even close to healthy and that taste reasonably good are Zone bars . These ThinkThin bars do not have much flavor and have an unpleasantly gritty texture . It amazes me when companies will call candy bars healthy and nutritious when they are far from it . These ThinkThin bars contain Fat and Sugar but No Vitamins . The front of the package says 0g of Sugar but the ingredients list 10g of Sugar Alcohol ( Maltitol ) . The only good aspect to these candy bars are that they are Gluten Free but they do contain Soy . If Gluten Free ( but with Soy is ok ) is your overriding requirement and you do n't care about flavor , taste or grittiness then you might want to try these ThinkThin bars . If you are watching your diet or trying to lose weight , not sure that these bars would be a good idea .	-1
The Chocolate Espresso flavor of the thinkThin bars is the only one I have tasted and I found it disappointing . There was no coffee flavor to the bar other than bitterness . Is that supposed to be the espresso flavor ? I have tasted many other things with a better coffee flavor . The chocolate flavor is strong but more of a baking chocolate flavor , not candy flavor . Of course since the bar contains zero sugar , barely any fat , and is gluten free , it is n't going to have a `` rich '' flavor to it . It contains 20 grams of protein but only 10 % Calcium and 15 % Iron for the RDA . It leaves a strong after taste that made me grab for a beverage to get rid of it . If you like a bitter chocolate flavor , then you would like this bar . Personally I wo n't be eating another of this flavor .	-1
I was looking forward to trying these bars as a good mid afternoon snack . It is really difficult to get gluten free bars that have a nice texture to it so this bar falls into the `` to be improved '' category . The texture is chalky and dense . The flavor was not as bad but it had some aftertaste to it . This bar tasted like cocoa powder mixed with some protein powder ( the chalky kind ) , then some oil ( or glycerin as it states ) and some sweetener . In this case it contains maltitol which is a sugar alcohol . I had an upset stomach for several hours and then lots , I mean LOTS of gas ... .not cool ... .wo n't be buying this , sorry .	-1
I 've tried many bars that are out there on the market . They all seem to be either hit or miss with me . These are a miss . I do n't care for them.The taste is not that great . The texture is not very good either . The size is n't bad for 230-240 calories but I just do n't care for them . They are n't so bad that I ca n't finish them but I just do n't care to.Chocolate Espresso- I found them to be only a tiny bit on the chalky side but they are quite a bit gritty . I do n't taste a very strong Espresso flavor . Did n't like the flavor at all.White Chocolate- These were a tiny bit better but not by much . The White Chocolate bar was just coated in White Chocolate but it was n't a yummy White Chocolate . It was lacking the yummy White Chocolate flavoring that I love.Chunky Peanut Butter- These were also a tiny bit better but again , not by much . The Chunky Peanut Butter did n't really taste a lot like Peanut Butter . It was lacking flavor and I did n't really see/feel any chunks either . There were some tiny little pieces that I felt while chewing but they were really , really small and it felt like chewing on unflavored coconut or paper . It was just odd.Brownie Crunch- I did n't find this bar to be much different from the Chocolate Espresso . Did n't like the flavor at all . Not much like a brownie in my opinion and there was no crunch.Dark Chocolate- Although I liked the dark chocolate coating , I still did n't care for the inside.Chocolate Fudge- This one was n't as bad as the others but I still would n't say it was good . It was just more edible . Coating was n't bad and the inside is the same as the rest , not good.I have some other flavors to try and although I 'm hoping I 'll find one of those to be more to my liking , I 'm starting to think that 's not going to happen.Unfortunately I would n't recommend any of the bars that 's I 've tried .	-1
I suppose if you are a big fan of dates you might like this thing because that 's all it tastes like . No chocolate flavor . No coconut flavor.I 'll eat them all because I paid for them but I wo n't buy anything else from this company.I gave it two stars because it 's not bad for you ( not the same as good for you ) .Later : Okay , I 've eaten the whole box and they kind of grow on you . If you really like dates , you 'll really like this bar . But I still wo n't buy them again .	-1
I love chocolate and coconut combination , and expected to have more chocolate-coconutty taste from this . Instead , it tastes more like prune with grains , and could not taste much chocolate nor coconut at all . Quality of the food is excellent ( ingredients . )	-1
Below was my original review however , since they 've been bought out by Kellogg/Kashi the quality and taste has completely gone downhill . There are barely any fruits/nuts , merely just flavoring . I was a Bear Naked customer for years but no longer. -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- This is a great natural snack food . Has lots of good stuff in it and is great as a mid-afternoon snack between lunch and dinner . While it may be healthy , it is not a low-fat food and though it can be easy to eat the entire bag , one needs to pay attention to that . That said , it is delicious !	-1
Amazon does n't allow zero star reviews ... and the one star I had to allow is far too generous . This product deserves about a negative 10 star designation . It is not organic ( one reviewer described finding it in the `` organic '' section of their local grocery store ) . The label on the bag claims `` 100 % pure & natural granola '' ( this claim is meaningless ) and on the back has the following : '' No artificial flavors ; No cholesterol ; No hydrogenated oils ; No high fructose corn syrup ; No artificial preservatives ; 0 g trans fat '' Notice it does NOT claim to be GMO-free and the likelihood is that this granola DOES contain GMOs , as it has non-organic canola oil . Please be aware that `` Bear Naked '' is not some folksy brand - it is a subsidiary of Kelloggs ... the same Kelloggs that has donated substantial amounts of money to defeat a California November 6th Right-to-Know Ballot Initiative ( Proposition 37 ) that would require mandatory labeling of genetically engineered foods and would , in the words of the Organic Consumers Organization put `` an end to the unethical practice , unfortunately common even in the alternative food sector , of marketing or labeling GMO-tainted food as `` natural . `` The group GMO Free USA , has launched campaign # 1 : Boycott Kelloggs , noting `` In this digital age , you have to wonder why a company would spend more money than it could possibly cost to change their product labels to fight against the consumer 's right to know what we are eating . `` Why , they might even have to label a seemingly `` clean '' brand like Bear Naked with the truth ... and then how much of this phony product would they sell ? Do n't be fooled ... I certainly wo n't be buying from Bear Naked again ... or any Kelloggs products .	-1
Since this was the only Bear Naked Granola on the store shelf that did NOT contain Canola Oil , which I 'm very allergic to , it was the only one I could use my coupon on . Maybe the other Bear Naked varieties : Bear Naked All Natural Granola , Fruit and Nut , 12-Ounce Pouches ( Pack of 6 ) , Bear Naked All Natural Granola , Peak Protein , 12-Ounce Pouches ( Pack of 6 ) , Bear Naked Fit Vanilla Almond Crunch Granola , 12-Ounce Pouches ( Pack of 6 ) , Bear Naked All Natural Granola , Banana Nut , 12-Ounce Pouches ( Pack of 6 ) , Bear Naked 100 % Pure & Natural Granola , Maple Pecan , 12-Ounce Pouches ( Pack of 6 ) , Bear Naked 100 % Pure & Natural Granola , Peak Flax , Oats & Honey with Blueberries , 12-Ounce Pouches ( Pack of 6 ) , andBear Naked Granola Heavenly Chocolate , 12-Ounce Pouches ( Pack of 6 ) , taste better , but I found this product unpleasant , with a foul aftertaste coming from the freeze dried berries.I recommend theBack To Nature Oat Vanilla Almond Agave Granola , 12-Ounce ( Pack of 3 ) instead .	-1
The label on the bowl says 35 grams is in the bowl and that it is 110 calories , but when I weighed it myself on my food scale it weighed almost twice that ! I 'm confused , does the whole bowl really contain 110 calories ? I really want to know can someone help ?	-1
Special K Bars , Vanilla Crisp , 6 - .8 oz Bars , ( Pack of 12 ) I ordered this item as an addition to my low calorie diet foods . I was extremely dissapointed in the fact that they have absolutely no taste and were very small . I have eaten other low cal bars made by Special K which were good , but the recipe for these should be discarded . I do not recommend this item to anyone who is looking for a low cal bar which also tastes good . Kellogs you missed the boat with this one .	-1
First If I could have rated this ZERO STARS.. I would havI would like to say I am a regular eater of protein bars . This is NOTHING like that rather a cut down version of a crunchy candy bar..1. it is extremely SMALL.. it did n't even fill the modest size package that is was wrapped in . Approx 2/3 of the size of a usual bar2 . it is Thin as well as short ... 3 . Extremely sweet and modest crunch4 . It might only measure 90 calories but most of those come from simple Sugar- the first 3 ingredients are SUGAR ... So if you want a sugar high fine but if your are looking for a healthy low cal mid meal snack that is healthy find another bar there are loads of them out there.So inconclusion this is a cut down candy bar faking it as a healthy low calorie item . Kellogg You can do way better than this ! ! !	-1
I buy all my cereal from Amazon . I am usually very pleased with products received from Amazon . This box of cereal bowls contained several bowls that were open ! All of the varieties I tried were stale and did n't taste right ; and the Raisin Bran actually seemed rotten . The first thing I did after encountering these problems was to check for an expiration or use by date . There was no indication on any of the packaging ANYWHERE as to when these bowls of cereal would no longer be appropriate for human consumption . By comparison , the General Mills cereals I 've purchased from Amazon have expiration dates on each and every individual bowl ( usually printed on the bottom ) . Kellogg 's makes great cereals - I have no problem with Kellogg 's - I think I got a bad box that had been stored away in the back of some warehouse somewhere that should have been discarded because it was way past its shelf-life . Amazon , of course , refunded my money . But , just beware that it could happen to you and if it does be sure to get Amazon to refund your money . Amazon 's warehouses need to be more vigilant . We ca n't just complain on here and hope the warehouses change their practices - we need to make our money talk to Amazon so they will get warehouse management/personnel to comply with Amazon standards and federal consumer laws .	-1
Kellogg 's cereals contain genetically modified organisms which have been patented by chemical companies that genetically engineered them in a lab and turned them into EPA registered pesticides . GMO Bt corn is an EPA registered pesticide and is one of the ingredients in Kellogg 's this products . YUK ! ! ! ! They are also made to be resistant to high levels of a chemical called glyphosate , an herbicide , which is linked to birth defects , cancer , organ damage and inflammatory bowel disease . It also has insecticidal properties and kills off beneficial gut flora . These GMOs have not been subjected to independent , long term , peer reviewed studies to prove that they are safe . These GMOs make my family sick . We do not pour pesticides on our food and we no longer eat anything that is an EPA registered pesticide . GMOs are linked to organ damage , faulty insulin regulation and obesity , autoimmune disease , autism and a whole host of other health and environmental problems . Kellogg has contributed $ 632,500 to a propaganda campaign in California which is spreading lies to convince people that they should vote again GMO Labeling ( prop . 37 ) in California on Nov. 6th because they do n't want you to know that they use GMO corn , soy , sugar and canola in their products . Frosted Flakes are NO LONGER G-R-RRREAT and neither are any of Kellogg 's other products . 50 countries around the world require that GMOs be labeled . Kellogg does not use GMOs in these countries . We are boycotting all Kellogg 's products . Join GMO Free USA , a grassroots consumer email initiative that is contacting Kellogg en masse with emails to tell them to Just Label It or remove it . Americans have the right to know what 's in their food ! [ ... ]	-1
Kellogg 's has come up with the ultimate in unhealthful snack foods with these bite size sugar fixes . Sure , the graham snacks are made with whole wheat , but two of the most prominent ingredients are sugar and high fructose corn syrup . And , the `` buns '' do n't taste much of cinnamon . For my grocery cart , these tidbits are `` out . ''	-1
It 's just a cookie ... and quite a fattening one at that . One 1.76-ounce pouch of Cinnamania Cinnamon Buns comes in at a whopping 230 calories with a significant 30 % from fat . The contents consist of several small graham cracker-type cookies with a white sugar glaze to simulate rather half-heartedly the look of a cinnamon bun . The consistency , however , perhaps due to the enriched wheat flour , is anything but and a pale imitation of what you would buy at a Starbucks or bake from a Pillsbury roll-up package.In fact , the weakly-named Cinnamania is more akin to something from Mother 's Cookies , the kind of unmemorable confection you would find in one of those big bags you get at discount on Costco . The flavor is not bad , just undistinguished considering how it has been positioned as a proxy for a freshly-baked bun . The package exclaims that it 's a `` Good Source of Calcium and 4 Vitamins '' , but it hardly warrants an endorsement for its questionable nutritional value . If you have a need for a cinnamon bun , then I suggest you go to your nearest Cinnabon in order to justify the calorie intake .	-1
The package for these cookies looks very inviting . I was hoping that the flavor of the cookies would be as delicious as the package . The cookies taste okay , though much less inviting than the picture on the package , and are significantly less delicious than genuine , fresh-baked cinnamon rolls . Worse , these cookies list sugar as the second largest ingredient and corn syrup as their fifth largest ingredient . Any product with that much sugar and corn syrup is unable to convince me that it is a `` healthy '' product , regardless of how many vitamins or other wholesome ingredients the product has.There are better tasting cookies , and there are cookies that are more up front about their calories . I am always suspicious of any cookie that claims to be healthy . Adding a few vitamins to sugar and corn syrup fails to make this cookie a health food . Do yourself a favor and either eat a genuine cinnamon roll , or get yourself some fruit and have a truly healthy snack.This review is based on a sample of the product provided to me by Amazon.Good luck !	-1
This popcorn was okay , but it was WAY too salty for me . I think they should change the `` simply salted '' to say `` seasoned with salt '' or `` nuthin but salt '' something that indicates that this is a very salty product .	-1
I bought this , took it home , and read the ingredients and saw SUCRALOSE , EWWWWWWWW ! If I had read it at the store I would n't have bought it . Either way I popped some anyways . It 's surprisingly good , it 's not great though . It has more negatives than positives . The positives are that it has a sweet taste for sure , nothing chemical or weird though . That 's about it for the positives . The negatives are that you need to eat a handful or the popcorn is bland , if you eat it in small handfuls THEN it tastes sugary and sweet . The popcorn is also cold , coming right out of the microwave , I think this is due to it not really having any coating like butter so it gets cold fast ... ... I like warm popcorn . It 's also really light and dry ... ... .I like buttery popcorn . All in all this popcorn is good tasting and I am really picky about this stuff and artificial sweeteners , it does n't taste fake or chemical to me . Have you ever had a popcorn ball ? It tastes like a less sweet version . I happen to love popcorn balls , some people don't.UPDATE : I only ate 1 bag of this stuff . It 's gross . I do n't like it .	-1
The SMART pop does n't have enough flavoring . : ( I do not like it sam I am .	-1
This must have been old even though it was not outdated . My cheapie brand pops better than this . Otherwise , it tastes good . I wo n't buy it again since I only get half the bag to pop .	-1
This product claims it is `` Simply Salted '' , though a read of ingredients I soon discover it has soybean oil .	-1
I used to buy the low fat version of this popcorn , but found it to be slightly too salty so I tried this . Oops . What a mistake . This is equally as salty , but this is like eating grease . The grease literally oozes out of the package before you even stick it into the microwave . Someone out there must make a good popcorn . This is not it .	-1
I can tolerate half a bag of this stuff , but then I find I need to drink huge amounts of water , due to the very salty nature of this product . Blech.I recommend buying the LIGHT natural instead , which has the same flavor , but almost no salt . The only problem is that amazon frequently runs out of stock on the Light Natural , which makes it hard to get . ( An alternative is to buy Natural + Bearito 's Unsalted and mix them together , thereby diluting the salt to a manageable level . )	-1
These things are like like soft chewy rubber . Typical of his type of `` food product '' .Packed in liquid that I really can not relate to a specific taste.The picture on the label is a joke.A chewy rubber disk in a `` flavorabel liquid '' If you are vegetable person and you eat this stuff maybe you like it.But DO NOT EVER think this is any where close to real meat .	-1
I am a big fan of Pamela 's Products . Their plain shortbread and pecan shortbread are incredible . So I was optimistic about the lemon shortbread cookies , since I 'm a fan of everything lemon-flavored . These cookies were a ) too sour , b ) soggy , without the crumbly , buttery texture of real shortbread and c ) they tasted like someone had sprayed Lemon Pledge furniture cleaner on regular shortbread , then sealed it in plastic while damp . Really , they were that gross . Not recommended .	-1
I am not a fan of these lemon cookies . I love other Pams ' cookies , but these have a too strong lemon flavor and that 's all I taste . I still have most of the case and I may just throw them out .	-1
I thot shortbread with lemon sounded yummy . Not the case..taste of lemon overwhelming , too strong for me , plus the taste was slightly 'chemical ' sure didnt taste shortbread .	-1
I 'm shocked to see such great reviews for this product . Admittedly I have only used this mix to make pancakes but they were just not good so I 'm hesitant to try making anything else with it.I love Bob 's Red Mill gluten free pancake mix and recommend it over Pamela 's .	-1
I had such high hopes . However , after both times I have made this bread now , I 'm bummed to have to state & # 8230 ; .I too am among those whose stomach just can not tolerate this gluten free bread mix at all . Unfortunately I get pretty severe gastrointestinal problems .	-1
I do n't understand why Pamela 's has to over compensate by using so much sweetener in their bread mix . If I wanted a sweet bread I would add my own sugar ! This is not a bread to have eggs and ham with . It taste more like a dessert . There are better brands of gluten free bread mix out there . Do n't waste your money on this one .	-1
It cooks well but still has that dense , sour , bitter taste that is typical of any gluten free breads that I have tried . I regret buyingthisin bulk without trying it first .	-1
Please note that this is not a review on the taste of the product - it is a review for what I believe would be the majority of people considering the purchase of this product - those intending to go wheat free / gluten free for the health benefits / weight loss etc . This is not a product that fits . It 's just a trade of one high glycemic index ingredient for others.If your intent is to go gluten free only/specifically - this meets the bill . If your intent is to go wheat free - in the literal sense , this also meets the bill . But if your intent is to go wheat free in the sense of the book Wheat Bellies and avoid high glycemic index foods that promote high insulin and fat retention - this is NOT the product to do it . As indicated in the Wheat Bellies blog ... Wheat raises blood sugar higher than nearly all other foods , including table sugar and many candy bars . The few foods that increase blood sugar higher than even wheat include figs , dates , and other dried fruits , and rice starch , cornstarch , tapioca starch , and potato starch-the most common ingredients used in gluten-free foods . A gluten-free whole grain bread , for instance , is usually made with a combination of brown rice , potato , and tapioca starches . These dried pulverized starches are packed with highly-digestible high-glycemic index carbohydrates and thereby send blood sugar through the roof . This contributes to diabetes , cataracts , arthritis , heart disease and growing belly fat . This is why many celiac patients who forego wheat and resort to gluten-free foods become fat and diabetic . Gluten-free foods as they are currently manufactured are very poor substitutes for wheat flour.I took a look at this product so that I may have some bread - wheat free . This is not a good substitute .	-1
I would not recommend this mix to anyone , it has NO flavor and its texture is not what home baked bread should be . Even my crows and four-legged animal in my back yard avoided this ' ? whatever ' .	-1
I also received the shortbread swirls in a crumbled state . The almond ginger cookies arrived fine in the same box and are excelllent . I did n't realize food products could not be returned until I just tried to return them.I would n't mind if these were simply broken , but they are crumbs . Pretty expensive bird food ! Pamela 's are the best Gluten Free cookies I have found , but I guess it is better to buy them at the grocery store for a higher price , than feed a whole case to the birds.I rate the cookies 5 but shipment of them 1 .	-1
... the Organic Chocolate Chip Pecan Shortbread 2-Count Cookies ( Pack of 12 ) were within 60 days of their expiration date upon arrival . They were tasty but crumbles , too many crumbs , NOT the nicely formed cookies depicted . I would n't buy theses again UNLESS I knew the expiration date was further out . Hopefully they would have an improved taste and form.So my first try with wheat and gluten free cookies was `` just OK '' : -s	-1
As others have noted , these do n't arrive as cookies . They arrive as crumbs . And , on top of that , the crumbs I received tasted stale . Customer lost .	-1
These cookies are very rich , oily and smell so strong that you can smell them through a ziplock bag . We wo n't buy these again . They did n't taste very good .	-1
I must say that I am a fan of gingersnap cookies , I love the combination of crunch and ginger . While these had a definite ginger flavor , they were very soft and that was a bit of a turnoff for me . I do like gingerbread cookies but these did n't seem sweet enough for my taste and the almonds seemed a bit out of place .	-1
From a Gluten-Free subscriber . Oh dear . I ordered this from Amazon because it is a dollar less per box than in the Martin 's store in their gluten-free aisle , and these are the best chocolate GF cookies we have ever eaten . BUT ! The cookies arrived totally broken into very small pieces and loads of crumbs . Guess they would be great for a pie crust , tho . What a dissapointment . They are somewhat tender to begin with , and I do n't know how Amazon can package them in a special way to prevent such destruction . We all know how packages are treated by the carriers who deliver them ... .not delicately , that 's for sure . So , will never order these by mail again and must pay the exorbitent price the go for at Martin 's . Pooh !	-1
Very disappointed in these cookies - I was hoping for a something great and ended up with extremely dry cookies , some were already broke on arrival and others broke by just opening the individual bags . The cookies are small - the image here makes them look a decent/normal size but they really are a bit smaller . Case they are shipped in is great for storage , in fact that was probably the best thing about the purchase . Look elsewhere for Dark Chocolate chunk cookies though ... unless you like dark , crumby hard ones .	-1
liked the individual wrapping ... the taste too much preservative or chemical taste . will not repurchase . you will have to try for yourself to see if you do n't mind the extra taste .	-1
Sorry , but I did n't like these cookies . The chocolate was good but the cookie part was not . I would rather not have any rather than eat these . Pamelas makes some good cookies , but not these .	-1
I have been gluten free for about six months now and have yet to find an edible prepackaged cookie . These were just as bad as all the rest . I remember as a little kid eating a dog biscuit on a dare , add some chocolate chips and that is exactly what they taste like .	-1
I had already tried the Dark Chocolate Chocolate Chunk and thought THANK HEAVEN for Pamela ! I would be able to survive GF ! There 's a slight sugar grain in the 'bite ' of them but they are tasty with a nice crunch . No artificial 'beany flour ' flavor . I even took those to a baby shower ( to share with a GF cousin ) I was completely in love.Then I tried these . I was absolutely shocked at how awful the Chunky Chocolate Chip cookies were . They are tasteless with that lovely texture you 've come to know and love . I make cookies for a living and would close my doors rather than put my name on these . I 've been inspired to start working on GF cookie recipes as soon as my Christmas rush is over.As far as the 11 good reviews - if you 've been GF for a long time or think Chips Ahoy are great cookies - you might like these just fine , otherwise , go for the double chocolate ones : Pamela 's Products Organic Dark Chocolate Chocolate Chunk Cookies , 5.29-Ounce Boxes ( Pack of 6 )	-1
I like many of Pamelas gluten free products but this one is not as tasty as her mini chocolate chip cookie or her ginger cookies . I would give it a 2.5 if I could .	-1
Peanut butter Cookies : Yeach . the pecan shortbread cookies are so wonderful and these had 5 stars beside them , so I ordered a case . nobody will eat them -- they 're rubbery . I 'm surprised because most of Pamela 's products are so tasty.Chocolate Chunk Pecan Shortbread : These are WONDERFUL , gluten free cookies . The only problem is , and it 's a BIG PROBLEM , that they were shipped in a tiny , tight box and so they were all in crumbles by the time they arrived ! Had Amazon packed them in a larger box and used bubble wrap OR the plastic air bags they often package with , the cookies would likely not have crumbled . So disappointed , because these are GOOD COOKIES .	-1
I , too , like other reviewers was surprised at the quality and texture of these cookies for a Pamelas Product . I am an avid consumer of Pamela 's gluten free products , but this one I will be feeding to the birds . First of all , they are extremely rubbery . When other reviewers comment that they are chewy , they are chewy times 10 ! And they have a strange taste . It 's like a pseudo-peanut butter flavor . Probably because they are also dairy free ? I would not pay the $ 3.60 per box for a measly 12 cookies again !	-1
I liked ginger cookies but these cookies had bad texture and not enough peanut butter flavor	-1
These cookies are essentially tasteless . I do eat them but after one the consistency is weird kind of mushy . The Betty Crocker chocolate chip mix is a zillion times better ... .except you have to bake . ; )	-1
I 've subscribed to receive Pamela 's GF cookie mix and after the second delivery of OLD mixes I am returning to buying them in the store . All of the last mixes during the last several months ( 6 bags per order x 2 = 12 ) have been OLD -- not expired , but the chocolate is dried up , light brown and crumbles to a powder . I discovered it 's not possible to return a subscribe 'n save order ( for some reason ) so I have to throw out the chocolate chips and use Ghiradelli instead . Whenever I have bought Pamela 's from Whole Foods the chocolate in the mix has been dark brown , fresh and never has crumbled to powder.AVOID subscribe and save on this item . Buy them in a store .	-1
Not at all what I wanted from a shortbread cookie . They had a cold , wet feel . Very dense , not buttery , not crisp . Terrible texture .	-1
These cookies are not of the quality I have come to expect with Pamela 's Products . In addition , there are only 9 cookies per box.I regularly use the bread and flour packages that Pamela 's Products produces and highly recommend them . These cookies fall short of quality.If you need to be gluten free , and in desperate need of a cookie only then would I recommend these .	-1
I 'm a fan of the Pamela 's Products line of cookies but this one tastes strange . It must be the agave sugar . When I think of biting into a shortbread cookie I expect something buttery and crumbly . This one is soft and chewy . I could n't get over that concept . Normally a box of Pamela 's cookies lasts 1-3 days ; the first box lasted about 2 weeks and then it was eaten only after every other & # 34 ; good & # 34 ; kind of Pamela 's cookies was out of the house and this was our last resort . I had to encourage my husband to eat these just to finish them up and he refused them more times than taking one . I wo n't be buying these again .	-1
Main ingredient is wheat and not SOBA . In fact buckwheat is next to the last ingredient but yet they sell this as Soba noodles	-1
Rice noodles have OODLES of flavor when cooked ( steamed ) . Absolutely no flavor at all . Indian grocery stores carry better noodles that soak in boiled water for 10 minutes . Or you can make FRESH ones if you have rice grains .	-1
I 'm astounded how much praise Annie Chun keeps getting for her noodles . When I see people practically orgasming at how wonderful they are , this tells me they do n't have much experience with this type of product.Do n't get me wrong -- her noodles are n't the worst thing I 've ever had ( except this one horrible exception ! ) , but there are better tasting noodles for literally half of what her noodles cost . For example , Myojo Udon puts out these delectable packets ( seeMyojo Udon Japanese Style Noodles with Soup Base , Chicken Flavor , 7.22-Ounce Bag ( Pack of 15 ) ) that can be had for about a dollar and they are way more flavorful than this particular bowl . ( Do n't buy them from Amazon , though , get them at your local Asian grocer 's or trusty online retailer ) .Of course , the Myojo Udon type noodles are n't as `` easy '' to prepare as Annie Chun bowls ( you ca n't really nuke them in a microwave ; you have to boil them , then add a flavor packet ) . But in the end , the taste is worth the extra hassle . I would sooner take a one dollar pack of flavorful udon noodles that took 5-6 minutes to prepare on a stovetop over a watered down version that took 3 minutes in a microwave .	-1
I 've never had miso soup but I highly doubt this is what it 's suppose to taste like . It tastes like hot toilet water . Seriously . It 's bland , no flavor at all , not even salty , just totally unsatisfying . I liked the noodles though but not even noodles can save this soup . I even added less water like reviews suggested and it did n't help at all . I 've also tried Annie 's Udon soup and it 's gross as well . I wo n't be trying anymore of Annie 's soups , they seem to all have a similar flavor that is just bland and disgusting .	-1
I purchased these on Amazon based on the nutrition information provided . It is a LIE . The packaging states 1 serving per package , 290 calories , 970 mg sodium . Thats a lot of sodium ! ! ! The nutrition information on this website states 140 calories and 470 mg sodium for one serving . If that were the actual case , I might actually try the soup . Now I will never know if the soup actally TASTES good or not since it has proved to be A VERY UNHEALTHY CHOICE . Please provide ACCURATE AND ACTUAL information so your customers can make INFORMED decisions . Waste of my time and money . The ACTUAL NUTRITION FACTS from the side of the carton are : Calories 210 , total fat 1.5g , Sodium 970mg , Total carbs 59g , dietary fiber 2g , sugars 4g , protien 11g . As you can see you are consuming about half a days sodium and depending on your diet , a lot of carbs with very little nutritional value . Had this information been available on Amazon , I would have purchased something else for my workday lunches .	-1
I bought these after a trip to Japan when I was craving miso soup ! I could n't find them in-store so I just went ahead and bought the 6-pack through amazon . I was so excited when they arrived , and so disappointed when I first tried one . They just do not taste good ! I 've had other Annie Chun 's products and loved them , so I was unpleasantly surprised with this purchase . I could n't even finish the entire bowl - in fact , I still have the 5 other bowls sitting in my cupboard . It was a good idea , but poor execution . I still intend to try another bowl in case the one I got was somehow bad , but I got the feeling that was n't the case . The reason I gave it two stars was because the noodles were fine , and in general I like Annie Chun 's products .	-1
Tastes like spicy cardboard . Really overrated product . I will not buy this again period . I do n't recommend it .	-1
Compared to other brands of instant soup cups , Annie Chun 's Hot and Sour Soup Bowl is pretty darn good . Compared to the other flavors of Annie Chun 's Soup Bowls , this one is a major disappointment.The noodles are fabulous , and the veggies reconstitute very well , as with all Annie Chun 's Soup Bowls , but unfortunately the flavor is really lacking . I ca n't quite put my finger on what exactly is missing , but it basically tastes like extremely watered-down hot and sour soup . I 'm Annie Chun 's biggest fan , so it pains me to leave a negative review , but the Hot and Sour is definitely out of my order rotation .	-1
To each their own , I suppose , but I love miso soup , and I love udon soup , so I thought this would be the perfect combination . After making a bowl of it , I was n't able to finish it . Hard to explain , but it was just ... gross . : (	-1
ANNIE CHUNG PRODUCTS ARE HORRID . GROSSLY STICKY , TOO SALTY , NOT AS PICTURED OR DESCRIBED , NO VEGETABLES . I WOULD N'T EAT THIS CRAP IF I WERE STARVING	-1
Perhaps Annie Chun ( and the rest of the manufacturers on the hot & sour bandwagon ) understand hot and sour soup to be a completely different animal than I do . Then again - maybe not.After discovering a love for hot and sour soup at our local Chinese restaurant , I thought I 'd try some of the store brands that said `` hot and sour '' on them . BIG mistake . The hot and sour soup I am used to is a flavorful , robust soup with chunks of tofu , pork meat , bamboo shoots , egg and dried mushrooms laced throughout it . It is slightly tangy affair and a bit spicy on the palette.By contrast - oh dear . Annie Chun has fallen into the same pitfalls the others have when trying to make a store-brand , prepackaged hot and sour soup . I must admit I was interested when I saw that the noodles were 'fresh ' rather than dried - but when you add hot water to them , along with the 'flavor ' packet and hot oil sachet ... ... .ugh . Tastes like someone strained a whole head of garlic and some chillies through a sieve and into a bowl of boiling water.The dried veggies ( most noticeably the green onions ) are godawful . They have a consistency more akin to bad calamari , and a taste that more closely resembles cardboard ( do n't ask how I know what cardboard tastes like ) .Just awful . Do yourself a favor - go to your nearest Chinese restaurant , and order like ten servings of hot and sour soup . It 's usually about $ 3-a-pop , and portion it out into individual freezer-safe tubs or sandwich bags . Freeze . Extract one-at-a-time from the freezer when you have the craving . MUCH HAPPIER ! !	-1
I 've tried several of these Annie Chun noodle dishes and soups with noodles . I do n't find any of them very good as compared with 'real ' Asian food . Some are n't too bad when doctored with some soy sauce , hot sauce , or other sauce . And some are n't too bad for ease of preparation.This one is n't easily doctored , nor is it that fast/simple to make . Therefore I do n't see any reason to keep in the pantry . If I do n't feel like spending 20-30 minutes to make my own Asian food from scratch , I 'll stick with better/easier ready-made products to keep on hand .	-1
I was disappointed in this product . Really bland , not much nutrition , boring . I am going to donate the rest of my boxes to a shelter .	-1
The noodles were okay , but I would rather use angle hair noodles . And the sauce was nothing more than soy sause which one can get anywhere . That is all there is to these packets , noodles and sauce.La Choy Chow Mein is 1000 % tastier .	-1
This is a gooey sticky mess . The noodles are one lump of noodles that I must run under hot water to separate before cooking in the microwave . The teriyaki flavor is a bit lacking . I enjoy Annie Chun products , but this is definitely a miss .	-1
I 'll just be blunt - this concoction is awful . The noodles are akin to rubber - so bad the dog would n't eat them after I washed off the peanut sauce . Remember those 1950s Swanson TV dinners or some of those coach class meals that were served at 35000 feet ? These are worse , much worse . I 'd even be reluctant to donate them to the next food drive that is fast approaching . The trash bin is the only safe alternative .	-1
I was optimistic about the flavor , based on the yummy soy sauce and sesame aroma coming from the finished product . But the taste ... oh man , the taste . It tasted like pure vinegar . The sauce was SO SOUR . The acidity overpowered any soy or sesame flavor by a long shot . The only thing I can think is that in order to compensate for the dish being lower sodium than most noodle bowl type things , they tried to ramp up the flavor with acidic ingredients . A touch of acidity does help bring out the flavor when you reduce the salt , but this was WAY too much .	-1
Even if you only leave the bag in for a few seconds the flavor is overpowering . I like cup of herbal tea at night enjoying everything from Chamomeille to Peach . I gave it away .	-1
This soup has two specific directions for cooking , with microwave or without microwave . Although the directions for preparing are rather simple , dealing with it was not easy . I cooked it in the microwave , and the bowl , if very hot , is rather cumbersome to hold onto . Draining it is a problem , and you may need protection.The bowl of soup nutrition facts claim 200 calories , total fat 2.5 , and Ogm of saturated or trans fat . Sodium is high , 440 it contains 38gm of carbohydrate . I purchased it for the lack of fat.You can add chicken , tofu , stir fried vegetables , and fresh chopped vegetables . Keep in mind that the meal comes with a small packet of dried tofu , carrots and spinach topping . The vegetable packet consists of very small pieces , and dry and dehydrated ! Not very appetizing.There is an odd flavor and consistency with the noodles , and the sauce was not all that tasty or flavorful ! First impressions are critical , and I 'm not sure I would try other Annie Chun 's dishes , and I will not crave the Teriyaki Noodle Bowl . ... .Rizzo	-1
This is just noodles and the vegetable is more of a garnish . I added chicken and broccoli so it was tolerable , but not tasty .	-1
I expected a bit more from the photo on the package . We all know they exaggerate a bit , but this was ridiculous ! I am not kidding , there were maybe 5 kernels of corn , 6 peas , and broccoli ? ? ? NO broccoli was in this ... there were some green flakes and maybe 10 tiny dried tofu cubes . The oriental noodles are spaghetti and mushy at that . We did NOT overcooked them . The flavor itself if tolerable . If you get it , be prepared to add a significant amount of veggies to it for it to resemble the photo on the packaging.We wo n't be buying any of these products .	-1
Normally , I could buy these types of noodles at NYC 's Chinatown for a dollar a pop , but I 've been getting lazy and tried testing these Annie Chun bowls when they showed up at my local supermarket two weeks ago.As it stands , the noodles and vegetables themselves are n't bad at all . However , the so-called `` teriyaki '' sauce is terrible . First , it does n't taste like teriyaki . Secondly , the sauce kind of tastes like watered down ketchup . If you 've ever actually added ketchup to your ramen noodles , you 'll know what I mean . It 's that slightly tangy , slightly sweet taste you get when you have n't yet put enough ketchup or seasoning to taste . Needless to say , I felt gypped . It was like I had paid three bucks for some basic Japanese noodles in a ketchup sauce.So needless to say , I would pass on these bowls . You 're better off gettingMyojo Udon Noodle Soup Mix Beef , 7.22-Ounce Packages ( Pack of 30 ) . No , these do n't come in fancy cardboard packaging or a thick plastic `` bowl '' you 'll bever use again , but they 're much cheaper and taste great , so what 's the difference ?	-1
I like most pre-packed Chinese noodles but this was just awful . Weird sour taste combines with overwhelming saltiness . Tossed them all .	-1
I do n't typically eat processed foods but I was sold on their mission statement of offering convenient , healthy , delicious meals made with only natural and organic ingredients ( 100 % Natural , No MSG , No Preservatives ) . I bought several to keep at my office , unfortunately , these Noodle Bowls are just barely edible in my opinion.The first one I tried was late last year . They were the Teriyaki Noodles and after trying to convince myself that it was n't 'that bad ' , I finally tossed it after just several bites . I refused to touch the other bowls in my desk after that experience but also did n't throw them out because it seemed like such a waste . Today , out of hunger and laziness , I finally tried the Kung Pao Noodle Bowl . While I did find this one to be more palatable and finished all but just a few bites , it really is n't something I could recommend to anyone.The Teriyaki Sauce and Noodles were just gross . The Kung Pao Sauce was at least tasty but the Noodles were still funky . Basically , the noodles are pre-cooked and vacumed sealed for you . Out of their packaging , they smell like playdoh and they look weird - like soft rubber - not like a food item . You add boiling water ( or microwave them with water ) to basically re-heat them , drain and add the sauce . I love the concept but that weird playdoh smell just never disapears and I find it hard to convince my brain that I 'm actually eating noodles and not some weird inorganic product . With the Kung Pao noodles , I chose to use boiling water ( over the microwave method I used the first time ) and after straining the noodles I repeated the process a second time with more boiling water to better 'rinse ' the noodles . This seemed to get rid of the weird smell a bit more and the sauce was flavorful enough that it covered up most of the remaining weird noodle smell taste.The last one I have in my drawer is the Pad Thai flavor . I 'm in no rush to try it but of course , wo n't throw it out ( I hate being wasteful like that ) but once it 's gone , I will not be purchasing any more Annie Chun 's Noodle Bowls .	-1
These noodles have a pungent smell , and hardly any pleasant complex flavors except a terribly salty , vinegary taste . I could n't even finish the bowl ; had to toss it . Would not buy this flavor again .	-1
I think I 've had this flavor ; they 're all so bland it 's hard to distinguish them . Not to worry , though -- the portion is so small it 'll all be over soon ! I 've tried several flavors and they 're all forgettable . I give up . The people who love them must not get out much ... ..	-1
I buy the miso with udon noodles ( I think that 's what it is anyway ) in this brand often . They 're $ 3.99/each at my local grocery store so I found these on Subscribe & Save and it was like half that so I bought a few kinds . This one , in my honest opinion , tastes bad . At first I thought it was the sauce but it 's actually the noodles , which by themselves , are really very tangy . I like tart , bright flavors , but this one is just weird for me . And it 's really high in fat !	-1
I love annie chun but this particular soup just does not do it for me personally , however you may love it . The soup has a very unusual taste . I really wanted to like this soup but I will stick to the other flavors that I love .	-1
My local grocery store was clearing out these for $ 1.25 each . I bought a couple just to try for the first time . I was disappointed because it was really small portion for the regular price of $ 3.79 . It also does n't look like pad thai or taste like pad thai . The sauce is sour and a little bitter . Glad I bought only 2 to try and cheaply at $ 1.25 each . Nong Shim ramen noodles are better tasting , very filling and way way cheaper too .	-1
We are allergic to corn starch , and though the Annie Chun peanut noodle bowl has none , as do the Udon and Miso soups , this DOES have corn starch . If you are allergic , or sensitive to corn , do not order this product . The corn is not listed , but believe me , it is there- and once you get your package you will see it on the label .	-1
And these noodles , ugh . I ate them all since I did n't want to waste them , but I 'll never order them again . Some people might like them , but some people are n't oriental , maybe they 're just Asian .	-1
Bad sauce . Good chew to the noodles but the sauce was just sour and bitter . Would not buy them again .	-1
The noodles etc were good but the peanut sauce smelled odious and tasted worse . I am making my own to get the rest 0f the portions down .	-1
Tried two different boxes of Annie Chun 's noodles ... . did not enjoy . These noodles are convenient and the Annie Chun noodle bowls are completely microwave safe , unlike 90 % or so of the imported Asian noodle bowl products.I will not purchase these again - IMHO , this brand is an acquired taste - if this was the only noodle product you ate for many years , you might get to actually like them .	-1
I have bought these numerous times over the years as a 'backup ' quick lunch at work if the need arises . Frankly it was my favorite flavor since I tended to vary the noodle flavors I bought over the years for variety . But this last order convinces me I wont be buying this flavor again . What once was a good `` Peanut Sesame Noodle '' is now a horrible `` Lemon Noodle with peanuts '' . They changed the recipe for the peanut sauce and it 's now just overpowering lemon grass . I do n't expect fine dining when I get these , but I do expect edible and it 's nearly not .	-1
This is the absolute WORST noodle bowl I 've ever had the displeasure of tasting ! ! ANNIE CHUN PRODUCTS ARE HORRID ! ! I wish I could get my money back . There are no vegetables to speak of , the noodles are sticky and the sauce is way too salty ! I learned from this dreadful experience to always read the reviews first ! Yuck !	-1
Loved the idea of a healthy snack so gave these a try . Tasty treat but WAY too much salt . They are soooo salty they gave me a headache ! If you are watching your sodium intake , skip these little crackers . It 's too bad , too , because otherwise they were a nice snack . Not going to purchase again .	-1
These were by far the worst peanuts I have ever tried . They are hot but taste nothing like chili . My son did n't like them either . They were n't even edible with beer .	-1
These nuts had a funk to them , I ca n't place it , kinda tasted like old nuts . I would not buy this again . I 'm throwing the rest away .	-1
These are nothing like the ones in the bigger tubs . These nuts are smaller , taste greasy and are very salty . I do n't mind salt at all , but these were way too salty .	-1
Not so good ! You 're better off buying any other cashews ... .Dry , small , and taste odd.Can NOT recommend .	-1
Added sugar , honey , corn syrup , fructose and corn starch . A healthy snack should not contain any of these . Freshness varies , too . I 'd avoid this product .	-1
This product contains Maltodextrin and so is NOT diabetic friendly . Maltodextrin reacts on blood glucose the same way as if you ingested table sugar . As per my physician : If you are diabetic , pre-diabetic or have a family history of diabetes you should AVOID maltodextrin.When I was first diagnosed with type 2 diabetes in January 2012 , though I cut back my carb/sugar intake to no more than 20 grams per day , my blood sugar readings would frequently shoot up from within normal levels to either close to 200 or even over 200 . I thought it was because my blood glucose meter was no good or something.The metformin I was taking caused gastric distress so I was on a clear liquid diet for a few days to clear that up . The diet consisted of water , low sodium , msg free chicken broth and sugar free jello . After I had been on the diet for almost 2 days , I had to go in for an additional lab . Since I thought my blood glucose meter was malfunctioning , I asked the lab to test my blood glucose and with the same blood sample , I used my meter to test . The lab test was 186 and my meter was 183 . The head of the lab said that is very accurate for a home meter so why was my blood glucose so high ? ? ? ? It turns out , it was from the sugar free jello that contains maltodextrin . It could n't have been from the chicken broth or water and those were the only two other things I was ingesting . Later , my new physician confirmed that maltodextrin was definitely to be avoided.Once I cut out all products with maltodextrin in them from my diet , my blood glucose readings quickly normalized and have been normal ever since.Note that this product says it contains maltodextrin from CORN . Most people know that corn is a carbohydrate and is NOT a free food for diabetics . Because of how the law reads , manufacturers who include maltodextrin in their products do not have to count it as a carbohydrate or sugar in the nutritional information on the label they only have to list it in the ingredients.This page mentions that the American Diabetes Association and the American Dietetic Association says sugar free Jello is a `` free '' food and I do n't know if those entities say that or not but it is NOT safe for diabetics and you can check with your diabetes educator or your endocrinologist to make sure but I 'm absolutely POSITIVE that it spiked my own blood glucose REPEATEDLY . If you still doubt it , fast for a few hours , take your blood glucose reading , eat some of this Jello then wait 15-30 minutes and test again . I 'm betting if you are like me - a non-insulin dependant diabetic - you 'll see a spike in your blood glucose . How many spikes does it take before it affects your eyesight ? Your kidneys ? Your heart ? Or before you get diabetic neuropathy ? I do n't mean to be an alarmist but if you have diabetes then you NEED to know what to avoid and those companies who tout their products as being diabetic friendly should have to tell the truth and be accountable . This is a DIET food but that does not make it suitable for diabetics .	-1
I 'm always appalled to see fellow diabetics extoll the virtues of many sugar free products because many of them contain a substance called `` maltodextrin '' which is every bit as bad ( if not worse ) than cane sugar for causing super spikes in blood glucose.Notice in the ingredients list , the first two ingredients are a modified food starch and maltodextrin made from corn . So ... .starch and corn ( which is also a starch ) . The way the law reads , those who produce food products do n't have to add certain substances to the nutrition information , they only have to list them in the ingredient list . Ingredient lists always go from most to least and by that I mean the first item on the list makes up more of the product than anything else . The second item is the 2nd most and so on so this sugar free jello is primarily made up of starch and maltodextrin from corn and if that was n't bad enough , you 're going to add milk to this product which is more simple carbs . There are over 11 grams of carbs in 1 cup of milk . You would be much better off to just eat a regular sized chocolate bar than to eat this sugar free product.This product might say in the nutrition information that it 's sugar free and carb free but that obviously is NOT TRUE because the ingredients say it 's not true . They 've added food starch and maltodextrin.My endocrinologist said that pretty much everyone should try to avoid ingesting very much maltodextrin but especially if you are diabetic , pre-diabetic , have a family history of diabetes or are pregnant ( gestational diabetes ) .The really sad thing is that much of the time maltodextrin adds NOTHING to the product - not flavor , certainly not nutrition . It is a cheap low calorie/no calorie filler.Maltodextrin is in sugar free jello , sugar free jello pudding , many sugar free hot beverage mixes such as Maxwell House sugar free coffee drink mixes and it 's in many sugar free liquid coffee creamers and I could go on and on . Please , if you are diabetic , READ the label and not just the nutrition info.When I was diagnosed with diabetes in January 2012 , my average blood sugar was in the 290 's and my A1C was a whopping 11.7 ! I figured out on my own that maltodextrin was bad and began researching it . Once I cut out all products with maltodextrin in them my blood sugar readings quickly normalized and when I went back to my physician at the beginning of April 2012 my A1C was 6.5 so I was able to reduce it to a much better level within just a few months . I could never have done that without cutting out the maltodextrin.Another bad thing about maltodextrin is it can adversely affect your appetite . Anytime you have big fluctuations in your blood sugar , it also causes fluctuations in appetite which can make it hard to stick with any kind of eating program.I 've been following a low carb/high fiber diet for years now because my husband , though a normal weight and very active , was diagnosed with type 2 diabetes almost a decade ago . I was sort of shocked when I was diagnosed with it and I 'll always wonder if we had just known about substances like maltodextrin that react so negatively on the pancreas if I could have avoided the disease or at least held it off until later in life and I cried when I realized that all this time , I 've been buying sugar free stuff for my husband thinking it was okay because his nutritionist never said a WORD about maltodextrin ( and other substances like dextrose , sorbitol , etc that also react on the pancreas ) and the reality is that I was making his diabetes/insulin resistance WORSE.I hope this helps someone out there . Wish I 'd have known about it much sooner .	-1
I just could n't eat it . I 've tried a variety of sugar free products and had high hopes for this Jello brand cheesecake pudding . However , the stuff tasted bad and the consistency reminded me of wallpaper paste . Sans Sucre has a much better pudding/mousse , made with Splenda , but it is much more expensive . I thought for sure I 'd like this stuff , but now I have a huge box of this that I ca n't eat .	-1
this tastes nothing like a real cheesecake not even close to what you would buy already made . my kids like it but as for me and my husband , we wo n't eat it again .	-1
Not even close , nobody cared for it , now I have a case to get rid of ! Ugh !	-1
$ 136 for 12 boxes ? Is this a rare item ? That 's $ 11.33 a box.I think the item might be a bit overpriced .	-1
For the Holidays last year , I decided to forgo the legitimate Pumpkin Pie and try something a bit lighter/healthier . I 'm familiar with Jell-O 's No Bake line , such as their delicious No Bake cheesecake , so I figured their Pumpkin Pie ( style ) mix should be good too . Well , it 's not . At first taste , I thought `` that 's not bad ! `` , but after a few mouthfuls of it , I could barely stand it anymore . There are two main problems I find with it . First of all , the consistency is off , it does n't really get to a Pie consistency , more like pudding as another reviewer mentioned . I 've added less milk ( 1.5 cups ) and that helped a bit with the texture ( now more like thicker pudding ) . Second , in order to compensate for the lack of any real Pumpkin , Kraft put wayy too much ginger , cinnamon , nutmeg or whatever else in there . The pumpkin spice flavor is overly pronounced and upsets my stomach after a few spoonfuls . So now I 'm stuck with a few boxes of this stuff trying to figure out how to use it and/or get rid of it . At the very least , I could use the included crust mixes for another one of Jell-O 's better flavors .	-1
Looking at the ingredients , this has zero pumpkin in it . That is why it 's called 'pumpkin style ' . It 's basically just sugar and preservatives . Addendum : Its now 2008 and I noticed that the ingredient list that used to be available is no longer available ... hmm ... hiding something ? ? ?	-1
I wo n't take up too much of your time . This is the singular worst tasting Shells and Cheese ( Mac and Cheese ) product I 've ever had . The cheese has the most bitter aftertaste and is so unappealing even my cats would not eat it ! I rarely , if ever , review food products but this one is so bad that I felt I must just to do my public duty ! So , for our house , its 6 thumbs and 8 paws down ! Awful !	-1
There is something just completely wrong with the way the bacon bits that are packaged with the Velveeta Shells and Cheese taste . Additionally the cheese sauce does not taste the same as the regular Shells and Cheese sauce , and not in a good way . Stick with the original .	-1
There are two Velveeta pasta and cheese dinners . This one , and Kraft Velveeta Original Shells & Cheese , 12 oz . They both use packets of cheese sauce , not packets of powder.But sadly , this one 's not that good . It 's salty , and the tiny bits of broccoli are few and far between . And with all the sodium ( 1230 mg per serving compared to 940 mg for the regular Shells and Cheese ) , it 's a long way from healthy.Shells and Cheese is better . It 's pure , creamy comfort food that goes down smooth and leaves no aftertaste . The pasta 's ridged-shell shape makes every bite taste good , as dribbles of cheese seep into each piece and stick to its sides . It 's much better than the broccoli version ... and way more yummy ( if more expensive ) than the regularKraft Macaroni & Cheese Supermac & Cheese Pasta and Sauce , 6-Ounce Boxes ( Pack of 24 ) .	-1
1000mg sodium per serving makes this extremely salty tasting , cheese has a slight off , bitter taste . Definatley wont be buying this again .	-1
YOU DO N'T GET MUCH IN THIS BOX , I GUESS THEM PUTTING THE BACON BITS IN THEY CUT BACK IN QUANTITY , BACON BITS HAD VERY LITTLE DIFFERANCE IN FLAVOR .	-1
I usually love this coffee but for some reason the last box I purchased I had to return due to a strange chemical taste and odd odor that is not normally in this coffee . I was very sad because I love this coffee	-1
I had a cup of Green Mountain at Christmas and it was so good . I came home and bought a Keurig and the Green Mt k cups . The coffe was beyond awful . It was not expired but something was very wrong . Bitter and undrinkable . I tried different sizes of cups and even purchased another box of GM k cups at another store . I found a brand that is good - prima barista Italian roast .	-1
Ca n't use this anymore because my Keurig K65 is a brick . What good is good coffee if your $ 200 coffee maker quits ? I 'm going back to a # 2 Melitta coffee cone system . Maybe I can crack open these K-cups and salvage the coffee .	-1
Really bought this coffee to brew at a larger size - 10 oz - instead of the usual 8 oz size for a bigger cup of coffee . Still too strong and bitter tasting at a larger size brew .	-1
Bought this for my mother who has been drinking Green Mountain Breakfast Blend since she moved in with me . I noticed the color of the top was different ( green instead of brown ) but did not realize until opening the package that it said light roast . My mother thinks it tastes like dishwater . Looked on line and saw that Green Mountain no longer had a medium roast so I ordered Tully 's House Blend which she says is much better .	-1
These K Cups brew a very mild cup , which is OK sometimes , but I have found that about one in six produces a very weak , tea-like swill . Not good . The price is below that of my favorite brew ( Pike Place Starbucks , always good ) but you get what you pay for ! If I have to dump one of every six cups , the bargain loses it 's shine . I will not reorder this brand .	-1
The worst raspberry salad dressing available . The flavors ( olive oil ? ) are fighting each other . It smells atrocious ... like someone 's dirty feet after pouring vinegar on them . And the odor lingers in the air , driving you to distraction.It will certainly make you wash your dishes quickly . There are amazing Raspberry salsad dressing put there . This is n't one . Disgusting	-1
During the big $ 25 Kraft promotion , I bought this to have something in the house for when my niece visits ... kids like Kraft mac and cheese , aunties would prefer to serve something a little healthier . So I figured with the price incentive , this was an OK compromise . I 'd tried it before , and it was fine . And I do love me some mac and cheese ( even this lowfat version ) in my weaker moments.Well , not this time . One of the boxes was kind of crushed in shipment and the macaroni was spilling out , so I thought `` what the hey , I 'll just make it for dinner . '' Ugh ! Big mistake ! Utterly disgusting . Unlike the reviewer who said the cheese sauce barely registered , I found it to be completely overpowering , and it had a horribly bitter chemical taste . I practically had to choke it down , and eventually I just gave up and threw it out . I have no idea if all the remaining 5 boxes will be just as bad , and I 'm afraid to find out . I hope others who purchased this product at the same time will weigh in with their experiences.I 'll definitely be sticking with Annie 's . Wish I 'd noticed that promotion before the Kraft one .	-1
Chose this one because of the creamy cheese vs the powdered cheese even though it was more expensive . I put it on Subscribe and Save because I was certain the family would be wanting it all the time and it would save me time and effort making it from scratch all the time . Received it yesterday afternoon and made it last night for the family as a surprise side dish . It was awful . I do n't know if I got a bad batch but the smell of the creamy cheese when I began mixing it with the hot pasta was so foul and nasty I had to open the kitchen windows to clear the stench out of the house . Mind you we 're in MA with over 6 ' of snow right now piled everywhere and filling every nook and cranny available and minus temps and wind chills so believe me , I would n't have opened the windows and propped the back door open to get rid of the smell if it was n't absolutely necessary.I remember having this as a kid , both powdered and creamy cheese but I sure do n't recall it having a smell like this . It ruined all our appetites . Because the smell lingered throughout the house , we ended up leaving the house for a while and going out to eat after riding in the open air to clear our nostils . Terrible experience . I was thinking of keeping the remainder of the first order and making it when no one else is home to give to the 5 dogs , but on second thought , if it is a bad batch , I certainly do n't want to feed it to my 4-legged babies . Out in the trash it goes and the S & S ; order canceled.Must admit I 'm disappointed . I was hoping to be able to cheat now and then with mac and cheese I did n't have to make from scratch but if this is the alternative , I 'll stick to my homemade recipe each and every time .	-1
This stuff is nothing but leagal poison . It is full of chemicals . It tastes awfull . It is a gmo . There is nothing about this product your children should eat . Buy amy 's organic it is comparable price and tasye like actuall food .	-1
I 'm not a believer in `` sneaking vegetables past the children , '' especially when the veg in question is in the form of pasta . While there may technically be cauliflower in it , it has none of the health benefits of eating actual cauliflower . There is also less in a package than original mac and cheese , and only two servings rather than three . Even if the cost per package is the same , that makes this product more expensive per serving.Cooking the very thin pasta for the six minutes directed on the package resulted in pasta well past the al dente stage . I used butter rather than margarine in the preparation but otherwise made as directed with no added ingredients . We got two decent sized servings from the box . The resulting mixture was just o.k . For me , the pasta had no texture and little taste , only a mild cheese flavor . Mrs. Boilermate said she could taste the veg in the pasta and said she thought it was a `` good addition . '' She thought it was less creamy than `` Easy Mac '' or the regular variety . She said Stouffers Mac and Cheese was better , and I agree with her.Overall there 's not enough here for me to like enough to purchase this product . You get less per package than the regular variety in exchange for a `` veggie benefit '' that 's a bit over-hyped . And , if Mrs. B. is to believed , one that does n't taste as good .	-1
This `` veggie '' pasta purports to sneak in a serving of vegetables and as well have less fat and calories than the original Mac 'n Cheese . It 's easy to have less when you change from a 7.5 ounce to a 5.5 ounce portion , which I first noticed when I poured the pasta into the water . It 's a lot less than a normal box , even though the box is roughly the same size.After cooking , the pasta smells vaguely of cauliflower , the vegetable that makes it `` veggie '' . Of any vegetable to choose , why that one ? What nutritional advantage does it have in its processed forms ? Even then , does it really matter what you choose when the chief ingredients are butter , milk , and cheese ? The taste is fine , but nothing special . It 's not quite the original .	-1
First thing to note is this box is smaller than the normal kraft mac & cheese ( 5.5 oz vs 7.25 oz ) . So you get 2 `` servings '' instead of 3 according to the boxes.As far as the veggie part ... the pasta has some `` enriched cauliflower '' ( whatever that means ) .It has more fat , cholesterol , and sugar than the regular mac & cheese . The only true benefit ( according to the box ) was the vitamin C difference.I decided to have a taste test with the family for dinner tonight . I cooked a box of regular mac & cheese and a box of these ... they did not know which was which . Everyone agreed that the regular one was better . Everyone also correctly guessed which one was the new one . Side-by-side there is definitely a difference in taste . In fact , the veggie pasta does have a distinct taste of cauliflower in these.In conclusion , the slight nutritional benefit is not worth the inferior taste and servings .	-1
This product makes it sound healthy having 50 % whole grains in the pasta however the part that everyone should be aware of is the 3.5g of trans fat . Trans fat is chemically made to prolong the shelflife of products and it is not good for ur health . Eating this each day is unhealthy due to the enormous amount in each serving . I suggest buying one that contains 0 or at minimal .5g trans fat if u must .	-1
Same old Kraft mac and cheese . I mistakenly thought I was ordering some one/two servings , i.e . instant mac and cheese , but was surprised , as a single person , to get a case of the larger boxes . My mistake .	-1
This was a disappointing `` macaroni and cheese '' product . Sure , it sneaks in some nutritional value , but face it -- you can add regular veggies like broccoli or cauliflower to regular macaroni and cheese with far more cheese flavor . This did n't deliver Kraft 's signature cheesy flavor or a significant amount of vegetables to the diet.My recommendation is to just stick to the regular mac & cheese products and have your veggies with it -- it 's going to be a lot better for you . This was n't a great dish , and far from a successful one.Economically speaking , it has fewer servings in the box to deliver that half serving of vegetables , and by the time that half serving is shrunk even further by eating less of the entire box ... there 's not enough vegetables to matter .	-1
At our house we usually make our own mac n cheese with real cheese but sometimes it would be nice to whip this dish up super quick from a box . However , after receiving this , we feel the extra time and effort is worth it . Even our 3 year old son said he did n't want this again . Yes , he has been spoiled on the real thing but I think in this instance , that 's a good thing . We have tried the Betty Crocker brand of mac n cheese since ordering this , and we do feel the Betty Crocker is a little better .	-1
When I was younger , I loved Kraft Macaroni and Cheese , easily eating an entire box myself for dinner . As I 've matured , I 'm now a home made mac & cheese kinda guy , but the Kraft flavor is still appealing ( kind of like a Macdonald 's double cheeseburger - not really a hamburger , but still quite munchable ! ) . That said , this is not what I want when I eat Kraft Mac & Cheese - ~2-oz less stuff ? Hrumph ! Also , though childless , I agree with other reviewers that describing this as a method to get veg into your kid is stupid . I much preferred the , `` If you do n't eat those vegetables you do n't get dessert ! '' method when I was a kid . It worked for me .	-1
I am generally a fan of mac and cheese , though I typically go for the sharp cheddar variety . I do n't have a big problem eating my veggies , but if I can get a little extra in while enjoying some mac and cheese I figured it might be worth it . Oh my goodness , but this was the most bland dish I have tasted in quite some time ! The noodles seemed a little more soft than those to which I am accustomed , and there was just no real taste at all to the sauce . After a couple of bites , I spent some quality time in front of my spice rack and finally came away with something I was willing to eat.So if you are on a soft , bland diet and you need to get in more veggies then I guess I could recommend this . But if you are able just stick with your usual mac and cheese and add a salad . You will get more veggies and your taste buds will thank you .	-1
There is really no added nutritional benefit to this product and to call it `` veggie pasta '' is seriously stretching the limits of credibility . I get it : kids love Kraft mac & cheese . Here 's I used to `` sneak '' veggies in to mac & cheese : at the last minute , I poured a handful of green peas in to the macaroni . Was it hidden ? Of course not , but my kids grew up thinking that was how Kraft mac & cheese was . It was only the occasional visiting neighbor kid who ever protested .	-1
I do n't know if the box I received was old or stale but this sure tasted like it so I gave it away .	-1
You look at the box and you think -- a way to sneak in more veggies that no one will notice . As good as that might sound , you have to look deeper at this box and the product inside.I prepared this for my family and I was immediately confused by the nutritional list on the box . Now a non-veggie pasta from Kraft Mac & Cheese has three servings , this listed only two but to be blunt it easily fed three people . It also listed only one half serving of vegetables per serving in the box so frankly with one box feeding three of us , it was basically adding no vegetable value at all.The taste was basically tasteless . We expect a certain cheesiness from Kraft and this just failed utterly . It was salty but not cheesy . The only creaminess was from the milk and butter I added along with some spice when it proved so bland.I could take a nice tomato and/or spinach pasta and add my own cheese mix to get a product that was tastier and healthier . My family would eat it and be better pleased as well . No one liked it in my household .	-1
To be fair , I 'm not a fan of boxed Macaroni and Cheese , I 'd rather make it with the real stuff ! But I was curious how veggie pasta would taste . I cant say this tasted any better than regular boxed mac and cheese . Didnt care for it .	-1
The macaroni is straight , not & # 34 ; elbowed & # 34 ; like the picture on the box . Prepared according to instructions , this is not & # 34 ; mother 's & # 34 ; . I will buy some & # 34 ; elbow & # 34 ; macaroni and & # 34 ; cheese & # 34 ; it up with either Velveta or Cheese Whiz . Or , without naming names buy the & # 34 ; real & # 34 ; stuff from the grocery store freezer .	-1
Had this for lunch today . It wasnt good , and I think I remember the regular boxed version being better even . It had a funny taste , not really like white cheddar , the other flavors I 've tried are better .	-1
We are a Kraft dinner eating family for decades and nearly every week we cook at least 4 boxes . This looked like a great idea for lunches at work . It does not taste like normal Kraft Dinner , nor do the noodles cook enough when following the directions . I will not buy this again .	-1
We usually eat the cup version from Kraft . I got tired of always watching the sales at my local store and rushing out to buy them , so I ordered these . First of all , these are not the cups . There is a plastic pouch with noodles and a paper pouch with powder . You have to use your own bowl . Not really a big deal.The weird thing is they tasted funny . Not quite as cheesy . Really they tasted stale . My 3 yo wo n't eat them . My husband and I both tried them and agreed they are off . We threw them out . Waste of money ... ..	-1
Not what I thought it would be . Not to my liking , taste bland , hard to cook as you do n't know how much water to use . I thought it was p remade & all you had to do is warm it up .	-1
I bought these for just under $ 15 a few months ago . They are now over $ 32 . This is for 8 bowls of macaroni and cheese ! DO NOT BUY AT THIS PRICE .	-1
The Amazon web site says they have bowls ( now it says cups ) included but you get 18 sets of elbow macaroni with a packet of cheese sauce . I bought these for work so I would n't have to fuss with washing a bowl . Value is okay if you do n't mind doing dishes at work . : ( The thing that upsets me the most is that the description states there is a disposable bowl / cups you can toss out . NOT ! Jan / 30 / 2013 Amazon has since changed the wording in their description . Old add said `` Disposal bowls . ''	-1
I thought I would purchase a cup of this upon happening upon it in the local grocery store . It was new , cheap , and well -- I like alfredo.Since Kraft does manufacture cheese , I was convinced that this recipe should be fairly impossible to screw up . I realized I would not be getting five-star Italian bistro , or even something which I have become comfortable making for myself . Instead , I assumed it would be a 'distant cousin ' of Chef Boyardee 's mysteriously vanished mass-produced chicken alfredo in a can -- bland and mass produced but ultimately edible pasta.If only I could have been so fortunate.The noodles tasted okay , but the sauce was THIN despite my having followed the cooking directions exactly and not overfilling the cup . If I wanted to recreate the recipe for this product , I would put noodles in grey-yellow-colored water . Doctoring it up with meat and veggies ( when chopped up to fit into the cup ) will make it look nice , but it will still taste blah.Even school cafeterias , hardly known for dishing out gourmet entrees , operate with better sauce recipes , aware kids eat Alfredo in the 21st century . Surely the various divisions at Kraft can talk with each other to come up with a little better product than this ? Especially thankful I had only bought my local store 's one trial cup , I do n't recommend this product to anybody wanting remotely decent pasta . People absolutely needing a pasta fix are much better off treating yourself to something from San-Francisco !	-1
I am a long time lover of Kraft Macaroni and Cheese ( the blue box please ) . I have tried many different brands of microwavable macaroni and cheese and most are barely edible . The Kraft Easy Mac falls into the barely edible category , just barely ! You receive 18 pouches with this product . THESE ARE NOT the Easy Mac bowls like you see in the stores . These are packets that you have to open , pour into a bowl , and measure and add your own liquid to . Like all Kraft Easy Mac , the best thing about this product is that it 's quick and easy to prepare , in fact , that 's the only thing I like about this product.The taste is NOTHING like Kraft Macaroni and Cheese in the blue box . This has a powdery , blah taste to it . The cheese is not strong enough to taste cheesy , but too strong to taste plain , so it has sort of a milk that thickened consistency and taste and is just disgusting . The noodles have that slimy , clumpy appearance that many microwavable noodle products suffer from . It 's not the worst microwavable macaroni and cheese I 've ever eaten , but it 's certainly not something I will buy again in the future .	-1
My kids eat the boxed Kraft Mac and cheese so I thought these were a great idea . YUCK ! I bought a whole case and had to get rid of them . No one would eat them ... they taste different than the boxed variety . They have a strong , fake cheesy , chemical flavor and odor ... ..maybe from the plastic the product is microwaved in . BLECH .	-1
I refuse to make and consume chocolate sauce on a regular basis just because I made the mistake of buying this in bulk.cocoa powder is healthier.Conclusion : not recommended despite affordable for newbie bakers and no taste problem.The one bowl brownies recipe on the back of all the boxes is not tasty . It 's missing the baking powder and coca powder ingredients from the Hershey 's Best Brownies recipe.Saturated FatsAll fats are composed mainly of triglycerides . These , in turn , are composed of `` fatty acids . '' These fatty acids fall into three categories : saturated , monounsaturated and polyunsaturated . Of these three , saturated fatty acids are the main culprit in raising blood cholesterol.Foods high in saturated fat come from both animals and plants . Animal-based foods containing lots of saturated fat include butter , beef tallow , lard and poultry fat . Seafood contains a small amount . Plant-based oils containing saturated fat include coconut oil , palm kernel oil , palm oil and cocoa butter .	-1
Kraft Foods ( owner of Baker 's Chocolate ) just DOUBLED the price of this product . There is no justification for this dramatic price increase , other than pure greed . This item , as listed , costs $ 4 per box . That is about 70 % more than it sold for in the grovery store just a few months ago , before the price increase . The price increase , by the way , came in the way of reducing the chocolate blocks to half of their original size . I recommend that you boycott and not purchase Baker 's Chocolate in protest.Edit : If the actual cost were 47 cents per ounce , that would be a good deal . But , with the $ 4.95 shipping fee , the cost per ounce becomes 62 cents per ounce ( $ 19.95 divided by 32 ounces ) , which is not a good deal , at all . The price at the store typically runs about 59 cents/oz .	-1
First , the potato strands are too easy to burn . After the initial cooking you press the mixture down , to brown the bottom . You turn them , which is interesting because they stick . Then you brown the other side . Now it is time to stir in the Velveeta cheese sauce.What is the point of browning both sides of the mixture , when the potatoes probably burned when you started ? Even Velveeta couldn & # 8217 ; t save this product.The dollar stores had a lot of this product . Want to guess why ?	-1
These noodles were very good , but my boxes had bugs in them - small , black , about half a size of a small ant . Packaging is bad - noodles are not sealed , they 're just plain in the box , coated in seasoning and all . Any bug can get into this box and feast on tasty noodles . I ca n't imagine why they made the choice not to put them at least in a sealed plastic bag inside the package . Plain noodles are ok , they 're completely dry , but this product was seasoned . For this reason I 'd never buy them again . Bugs took good 2 months to get rid of , extremely annoying in a completely bug-free home . Now I understand why all seasoned noodles come in plastic packaging . I had to throw out all remaining noodles .	-1
There are two main problems I see with this product ... number one , squeeze bottles of any kind are just terrible for mayo and salad dressing . Number two , miracle whip 's formula has changed over the years to remove most of the fat from it . I 've stopped buying miracle whip and buy the off brand 'salad dressing ' for this reason , they still have full fat formulas . Just a heads up . Full fat stuff works much better for stuff like pea salads and the like . Much richer flavor .	-1
Miracle Whip , 18-Ounce Bottles ( Pack of 12 ) is one sweet , obnoxious product I have ever encountered . From what I hear people either loves it or hates it . I am in the latter category . Even if I was on a deserted island and this product was the only one available to accompany be that a fish freshly caught , a salad made of the abundant vegetation this island would offer , a loaf of bread that unexpectedly drifted towards the shore in a waterproof container , Miracle Whip is a resounding NO . And now the commercials try to make it look like the rebel of mayos , the one who did not played by the rules . Way too sweet to be anything other than a disastrous addition to any course served in my table . 1 Star since 0 is not available .	-1
I love mayonnaise - the bland types . However , I ( like some others ) continue to hate the tangy , skunky flavor of Miracle Whip . If Miracle Whip were the only mayo on earth , I would never eat mayo again .	-1

Keep Looking ... ... ... ...	-1
I bought these and the salted variety because I make homemade peanut butter . I should have paid closer attention to the ingredients . These peanuts include cottonseed oil , a hydrogenated oil . I do n't know why they do n't just roast them with peanut oil . Well actually I do know why : Peanut Oil is more expensive than cottonseed oil.If roasted with peanut oil these peanuts would be healthier and in my humble opinion taste better . I 've switched to buying peanuts from The Peanut Shop of Williamsburg [ ... ] which are also available via Amazon Prime though unfortunately not part of Amazon 's Subscribe and Save Program . I just bought the last 3 cases ( two unsalted and one salted ) though so you 'll have to wait until they get more . They are more expensive but better quality and healthier food normally is more expensive.If you care about your health , stay away from hydrogenated oils and , accordingly , stay away from Planter 's Peanuts . Once you become accustomed to the taste of unadultarated peanuts you 'll never go back .	-1
Did I just get a bad batch or what ? My wife and I use normal Maxwell House coffee every day and love it . It 's flavorful but not too bitter . But then I tried this . Not only does it smell bitter and acidic , it tastes the same way . There is no real flavor to it , it is strongly bitter ( to my taste ) , and it does n't even taste good with cream and sugar . Hoping I just got a bad can , but at this point , I will not be buying Wake Up Roast again .	-1

I regret I bought these nuts . There are too much sugar and fat in them . Not a natural fat from nuts , but rather saturated fat from `` milk '' chocolate in amount of 30 % of daily allowance ( there are 2.5 servings per bag ) . Milk chocolate covering is probably the worst I 've ever tried . Planters make good nuts , but chocolate is not their strength . But you 're already fat it wo n't hurt you !	-1
While these nuts are edible , I am most disappointed in them . Not all of them are crisp and crunchy . Some of them are soft and chewy . The taste is not very consistent from nut to nut . I was expecting more from a Planters product .	-1
These nuts are drenched in oil ... the only way to eat them is to rub them with a paper towel first ... then they are edible . I would not buy again .	-1
These are just less than acceptableNot especially beefy nuts.More like the stuff that ; s fallen to the ground and been recaimed	-1
The pecans all tasted sour . Yuck ! These sour gross pecans ruined a HUGE batch of waffles I was making for a breakfast party . So embarrassing ! ! I 'll stick to the old-fashioned way : going home to my parents and picking up the pecans that fall off their tree !	-1
These just do n't taste right . I think it is the kind of oil they are using . Best cashews are at Costco . That 's where I 'll get them next time .	-1
Not really my taste but gave them away the guy loves them .	-1
I got these because they were cheap and i got what i paid for . These taste like something would buy in one of those vending machine snack packs . Salty , small broken pieces . I gave it away at work . I stick now with my raw organic Brazilian cashews , cost about three times more but taste 6 times better .	-1
As someone who did not grow up eating this stuff , I admit that a lot of its praise is lost on my family . It really is quite a different beast than what most people would consider Spaghetti . It tastes more like a pungent herbal version that is as to spaghetti what a veggie burger is to a hamburger . In a similar fashion , opinions are going to vary widely and I 've found that many people recoil a bit because they simply were n't expecting it to taste so different . That does n't make it bad , by any means , but I would suggest that you do n't start with a whole case . Personally , I find a simple dinner made with store brand sauce and noodles vastly preferable .	-1
Oh my god . I expected so much more from a food with 4.5 stars.This tastes worse than the cheapest spaghetti at a cafeteria . Like canned food.I could n't even eat half a bowl , let alone a whole box !	-1
yeast extract is msg -- a neurotoxin . Take it out of your products Rapunzel ! ! You think people that care enough to buy vegan want msg ? While food additives are n't unusual ( for instance , salt is an additive ) , it is rare to include a food additive that can actually cause severe health problems . Some of the side effects of consuming MSG include : burning sensations in the back , neck , chest ; paralysis ; numbness in the same areas ; tingling or warmth in the face , arms or back ; nausea ; facial tightness ; rapid heartbeat ; chest pains , asthma attacks ; drowsiness or cravings for other foods.Reactions to MSG may happen at any time , from right after MSG is consumed to up to two days later.Read more : Side Effects of Monosodium Glutamate | eHow http : //www.ehow.com/about_5066340_side-effects-monosodium-glutamate.html # ixzz2VGrkY3sF	-1
Not only does this product have too much sugar to really be healthy , but it also tastes like cardboard . Nobody would eat these , and I had to throw them away . I tried to eat these twice myself just so they would n't go to waste , but each time , I took one bite and had to throw it away . It 's really pretty inedible .	-1
my kids like all of the flavors but chocolate . They say they just do n't taste very good .	-1
even the website says they are wheat free only , not gluten free . oatmeal can contain gluten if it 's grown where wheat was grown previously , it picks it up from the soil . I would n't trust these until the company says they 're certified gluten free .	-1
I ate this brand for years until I was put on a sodium restricted diet . There 's no reason that I can see to add salt to oatmeal . Until Nature 's Path at least lowers the sodium I 'll be buying instant oatmeal with no salt added - yes it 's available .	-1
I tried these , even though I have n't had a toaster `` pastry '' since I was a kid ( and did n't much care for them then , either ) . For what they are , I suppose they are good , especially considering the healthy/organic angle . However , honestly , I would n't bother purchasing these again . They are a hard , piecrust-like wrap encasing a very thin smear of jam , with another very thin smear of `` frosting '' on the outside . The flavor honestly is pretty much `` sweet cardboard '' . Just not really worth eating , in my opinion . A piece of toast with jam is more appealing .	-1
Better than the non-frosted blueberry , but I 'm just not a fan .	-1
I picked up a pack at the West LA Whole Foods and could not finish the first bite . The bars had a funky taste that suggested either spoilage or poor choice of ingredients . The same taste permeated the exchanged strawberry bars too . I recommend trying them first before you commit to a whole case .	-1
If you like Rice Krispie squares , you 'll probably love these granola bars . That was the first thing that came to mind , trying these.Way too sweet , with a gooey consistency . I was not impressed and would n't buy again.The only thing that was good about these was that the ingredient list was mainly organic .	-1
Sadly , this is no longer the super-premium jerky that it used to be . Granted , if you 're used to grocery-store jerky , then this is still a much better product . But if you 've acclimated to chemical-free jerky , then the `` smoke flavoring '' that they 've recently started adding tastes like , well , smoke flavoring , and not the real thing.You may not notice a difference . Apparently jerky is one of those things where you notice a down-shift in flavor , even when you would n't notice an up-shift in flavor . ( Like margarine eaters think butter tastes fine , and powdered milk drinkers think cartoned milk tastes fine , but when people do the opposite , they find the tastes terrible . Jerky is the same -- if you upgrade from convenience store jerky to premium you might not notice it , but when you downgrade from `` the real thing '' to anything else , it tastes distinctly artificial . ) I used to buy this in bulk every few months ( with a discount per Amazon Subscribe & Save ) , but the change in flavor made me double-check the ingredients list , and I found that the new `` smoke flavoring '' was added when they changed packaging . So this jerky is good , but not worth the premium any more . If anyone has a suggestion for an all-natural replacement without ingredients like `` smoke flavoring '' I 'd appreciate it , since I 'm now searching for something new .	-1
I would give this really a 1.5 star , but I was generous . It is way too sweet . Others have said the same in their reviews , but I ignored them to my chagrin . It is very very thin and has a texture and appearance like it has been reconstituted and highly processed . Because it is so thin , there are never any big lumps of gristle , but sometimes you can tell the meat quality as a bit off in some pieces . The worst problem is the overly sweet flavor , the second problem is the texture and meat quality . This is not a very good jerky . Their Buffalo , while also too sweet , is much better as is their Turkey . They are much much less expensive than a really premium jerky like those from Mountain America , so it is a toss up . For the price , I may re-order the Turkey and perhaps Buffalo , but I will never order this Beef again .	-1
After an initial positive experience with the product , I ordered a second pack of 8 . The first pouch we opened was fine , however the second was where we encountered a problem . The meat in the bottom of the package was covered in a thick nasty mold . I reached in and was about to take bite when I noticed the mold covering it ! I 'm guessing the seal must have somehow broke on the packaging ? Just make sure you check before eating !	-1
Short and Sweet : this jerky is quite sweet , compared to commercial jerky . In a one ounce portion , there are seven ( 7 ) grams of carbohydrates . For those on a low-carb diet , that is a significant amount.I notice that in the more `` natural '' jerkies , they tend to use more sugar . Perhaps it helps the texture and make the jerky a little less likely to dry out.It does show this on the label , which Amazon makes available , so do n't make the same mistake I did and buy impulsively.If you are trying to find a beef jerky without preservatives , and from animals raised without antibiotics , etc , then this product is acceptable , if a little sweet . But if you are on a high protein diet , avoiding carbohydrates , then beware .	-1
UPDATE 16 September 2013 : Just called Nature 's Path after verified problems with our most recent purchase . I 've used two of the six bags and repeatedly get `` my '' symptoms associated with gluten ( yes , everyone 's different ) . After nearly 30 years of eating gluten free , with `` accidents '' and early lack of knowledge along the way , I am very careful before blaming one product . Something has changed with this product . I 've slowly gone through two full bags , eating some one day , reacting that day , waiting a couple of days to `` settle down , '' repeating , and getting the same reaction , again and again . Initially , I did n't associate my `` symptoms '' with the Mesa Sunrise , because it still showed `` gluten free '' on the bags and I 've got a many-year history of eating this product successfully . But after several days with symptoms , I realized it may be the cereal , thus beginning my `` rule-out '' experiments . I also tried several days in a row , `` toughing out '' the symptoms , just to see if it settled down on its own ( or ruled out this cereal ) - no change - still reacting , whether one day eating Mesa Sunrise , or several in a row . And symptoms subside after 24-48 hours , reappearing ONLY when I 've reintroduced the cereal into my diet . It 's pretty certain where the reaction is coming from - sadly for me . This has been my FAVORITE gluten free cereal for years - I buy it by the six bag case.I have to say that Nature 's Path responded just like one would hope a company with integrity would respond . The customer support representative told me they did change where the product is made about a year ago , but that they 're still testing machinery before gluten free runs just as before , so there should be no issues . She had no explanation for my reaction , unfortunately . But she promised to send me coupons for all six bags ( not just the four remaining ones ) if I 'd just scan in the remaining four bags to verify UPC and `` Use By '' date information . That 's reasonable - they should n't be expected to just hand out coupons to anyone that calls in an alleged problem . I 'll gladly use them on some of their other gluten free products.I really hate knocking down my previously 5-star rating , but would not want someone else that needs to be gluten free to experience what I experienced after all these years of no problems ( I 've purchased dozens of the large Eco bags of this cereal over the years ) . I 'll miss it ... . I will say that if someone does NOT have to eat gluten free , this is still a great cereal . I have no idea what other reviewers are saying about this cereal being bland , tasteless , thin , etc . Whatever differences there are were negligible ( until I started reacting ) . I 'm going with a 2-star rating because a previously gluten free cereal gives every bit of indication that it 's no longer gluten free despite the label . Otherwise , my 5-star rating would still stand for non-gluten free customers.=========== Original 5-star Review Comments Follow ============As I said in the title , this is great cereal that also just happens to be gluten free . It 's not a `` kids '' cereal , and has a distinct taste that is somewhat unlike any other ( so it 's hard to describe ) . I purchase it by the case ( six ) of the large bags ( 26.4 oz./bag ) , and eat it often . I do n't know what else to say beyond that - great cereal , very good pricing even when compared to much poorer quality `` supermarket '' cereals . Nature 's Path makes a number of really quality cereals , and this is one of my favorites . I give 5 stars only with truly superior products - and this one is a no-brainer.I can imagine there will be some who will not like the taste all that much ( especially those used to sugared cereals ) , so perhaps buying one smaller box at the grocery store would make sense to `` sample '' it ( if they even carry it - try a health food store or the `` natural '' section of your regular supermarket if they have one ) .	-1
The last shipment that Amazon sent to me was with the product past it 's Best Before date . The cereal smelled so terribly that I had to dispose of the whole shipment ; that is six bags.The cereal is actually excellent when fresh .	-1
Maybe salty oatmeal is a British thing ? I do n't know . But man , this stuff is pretty nasty.If you were raised on salty oatmeal , knock yourself out . More power to you . I guess there are people who love this taste , God bless them , but I will never understand how that 's possible.For our family , this was a huge waste of money . We have loved every Nature 's Path product we 've tried up to this point , but geez . We just do n't get this one .	-1
The flavor was wonderful but i just could n't get past the gritty texture . These are going in the trash .	-1
No MSG , no hormones , no antibiotics , makes for a great purchase in my book . So why only two stars ? Unfortunately , after giving Golden Valley a chance with both this and theirSweet N ' Spicyflavor I could n't make myself enjoy the taste . The texture is strange , it reminds me of chewing cube steak . You know it 's beef but you also know it 's a little too chewy to be steak . It 's possible people who like their steak rare may enjoy the chewy texture as it 's not too tough as far as beef jerky goes . Plus , something about the flavorings they use gives the meat a sour , almost rancid taste . I 'm guessing it 's the apple cider vinegar as it reminds me of fruit or apple juice that 's turning bad . They need to improve their flavors before I try them again .	-1
This jerky sounded pretty promising.It has a great price , and they use quality beef and no chemicals.When I got it , however , I was very underwhelmed by the flavor . It was too sweet , and not spicy enough . Also , when I got done chewing on a bunch of it , I would have a wad of unchewable fatty junk in my mouth which I had to spit out.Pros : -They use quality beef with no growth hormones or antibiotics-None of the chemicals that are in a lot of jerky-Texture was good , but not great-Good priceCons : -Not very spicy-Sugar is the second ingredient , making it way too sweet and not as healthy as it could be.-Beef cuts a little too fatty.I would definitely not buy this flavor again , and I would probably keep looking before considering another bag of Golden Valley Jerky .	-1
hard to explain why this was so gross , the texture of it was like it had a sticky film of tripe or something on it . tasted ok but felt icky in my mouth . it also wasnt the best smelling jerky either . alot of the peices had really rough texture like there was still cartilige in it or something -and you literally could not chew it . some peices were better than others within the same package , but compared to most others beef jerky ive had , ill only give it one star .	-1
I did n't like this jerky at all . I read other reviews and decided to try it . However , the bag I received was very soft and sweet . I realize that it 's called `` sweet '' n ' spicy , but it was n't spicy at all . The sweetness was overpowering . I prefer at dryer jerky also . This was so soft that you could bite right through it . I 'm used to jerky that is tougher.I know I 'll never purchase this brand again .	-1

I bought this on the recommendation of a friend who LOVES this tea . I do n't find the vanilla taste strong enough , nor is the hazelnut flavoring strong . It 's not distinctively either taste and I do n't care for the blend even though I love both those flavors .	-1
I 'm used to cheap tea ( by the way , cheap tea is n't low quality ) , but this one 's awful . It tastes like very spicy water.. water with Tabasco added , essentially . Although I did steep the tea bag for about four minutes , there was no depth to the flavor . I finished the cup , but I certainly would n't buy it .	-1
Remember `` Raw Bits '' , that cereal sponsor for the `` Prairie Home Companion '' ? The one made from `` oat hulls and wheat shafts '' ? By George I think I 've found it ! YES ! ! ! This is the number one most crunchy thing on the planet , which is edible . I 've not broken a tooth yet , but my ears still ring from eating it . And I tried to like it . At first I thought I liked it . Later I thought I hated it . Then I decided that I was missing the point ; `` Raw Bits '' is not about flavor , it 's about commitment , it 's about doing the right thing , it 's about put up and shut up . Think about your Norwegian Bachelor Farmer ancestors , for gosh sakes ! Do you suppose that they whined about their cereal not `` tasting good enough '' ? Of course not ! Eating Heritage O's/Raw Bits gives shy people the courage to get up and do what needs to be done ! ( Now could someone please help me find those tasty and expeditious `` Powder Milk Biscuits '' ? )	-1
I really wanted my kids to like this , But unfortunately they do n't , it would not soak the milk so it stayed crunchy , and its bigger and bulkier than Cheerios ( which was the cereal I was trying to replace ) , I still think its very good quality ( Organic and Non-GMO ) , I will offer it to my kids as a dry snack they might like it better , or try to cook it in milk to make a sort of porridge out of it and maybe include it in my baking .	-1
I got these hoping they 'd be a healthy alternative and low cost option for our family 's breakfast . Unfortunately , my son has balked at this super-crunchy , wheaty-tasting cereal and , frankly , my husband is n't that big a fan either . They taste very `` raw '' ( ca n't think of a better word for it ) and , no matter how long you soak them in milk , they never seem to soften even slightly . These may be pluses for some people , but if you 're looking for an organic Cheerio replacement , as I was , you 'd be better off with `` Barbara 's Bakery Organic Breakfast O 's Cereal '' ( also sold on Amazon , though priced higher per oz . ) .	-1
This product comes up in a Gluten Free search , but it contains WHEAT and is therefore NOT gluten free .	-1
Gluten free for sure , And like most gluten free items you dont quite know what to expect for the taste , knowing it wont taste like the regular `` flour '' version . All I can say is that I have a sturdy stomach , and enjoy almost any flavor . But these , well these I dont know what to say . They were bland but had a distinct taste , while not bad I would call it odd . These were not for me , and as many other reviewers have stated , not these . I cancelled my subscription to these and went and grabbed a glass of water .	-1
These just taste weird . I do n't know how to describe it . I knew they would n't be like `` regular '' rice krispy bars , but these feel weird with a clear sticky type of glaze & have a very odd rice & peanut butter taste . They also have an aftertaste . My toddler ate half of one , but has n't asked for one since .	-1
I grew up eating the puffed rice in the big bags ... by Malt-O-Meal and I LOVE that stuff . Thought these would be similar but it was n't the case . I ended up donating them to a thrift store that offers free meals ... so at least it went to a good cause :0 ) I couldn'teven dress them up with a little white sugar .	-1
I live in a remote area where I can not get these great products . I ordered two different kinds of this cereal and all 6 bags of the oat bran flakes smelled very rancid when the bags were opened . It is not returnable as I later found out . Warning , buy cereal close to home not online , it was an expensive lesson . The chickens will eat well this week .	-1
I had to double-check the expiration date : Yep , expires a year from now . Still , it smells and tastes like oil gone bad . There 's soy . There 's flax . There 's something sweet . But it 's all drowned out by the taste and smell of the bad oil . I opened two bars to be sure , and passed one to my coworker to smell . `` Yeah , gross , '' she said . `` I usually eat stale stuff , but I would n't eat that ! `` Although I purchased this exact product locally , I did not buy it from this retailer.I 'm surprised and disappointed - their pumpkin granola cereal is my favorite cereal ! I much prefer Cascadian Farm 's crunchy pumpkin granola bars , but they 're hard to find . Kashi 's are good if you do n't have a wheat or a gluten allergy .	-1
I wanted to like this . I like ginger teas for upset stomachs ; I love cranberries in most forms . Unfortunately , this flavor was just too far out there for me.Texture of the oatmeal was okay but not great .	-1
I usually love Nature 's Path oatmeal but this was disappointing . The flavor is a bit off and it is full of soynuts , wth ? They should have mentioned that but here is the thing ... ..where are the cranberries . There are literally about 3 half cranberries per package , again , wth , are cranberries that expensive ? Do n't buy this flavor , there are other flavor that are wonderful , this is n't one !	-1
These corn puffs were pretty bland . I could only get my kids to eat it by adding alot of sweetener ( I use organic evaporated cane juice , or unrefined sugar as I call it ) and a little sprinkle of cinnamon . I probably will not purchase again .	-1
I have eaten this before and am usually satisfied with the product when purchased in a store like Whole Foods . However , I thought I would try an online purchase because I can no longer get the cereal where I currently reside . Bad mistake . This cereal was stale upon receipt , not so much in taste ( although it was oddly bland ) , but more in texture . I 'm not sure whether this is because of how it was packaged but I noticed that the bags were strangely thin in places . I can not recommend this unless you like old tasting puffs .	-1
As an avid vegetarian cook and cookbook author , I use a lot of different herbs and spices . But sometimes , I do like the convenience of a basic , all-purpose seasoning blend.I tried Bragg Organic Sprinkle Seasoning recently and had hoped it would be a good alternative to the non-organic basic seasoning blends that are available ( ie Mrs . Dash etc ... ) Unfortunately , having rosemary as the dominant ( first ) ingredient is not a good choice . It overpowers the rest of the ingredients that are included in this mix.I plan to transition to making my own organic seasoning blends very soon , having found a good supplier for organic herbs/spices recently.This is not a seasoning blend I would buy again or recommend.Geraldine Helen Hartman author of The Groovy Green Kitchen and Not Just for Vegetarians	-1
It 's a nice time-saver for a meal , but watery sauce without alot of flavor and not alot of gusto .	-1
Title says it all . This product `` pours '' out of the pouch almost like a soup . I was very disappointed in the taste , but I 'll make myself finish the six . I much prefer the Bombay Potatoes and Jaipur Vegetables .	-1
It 's too bland for my taste , it has absolutely no kick to it . Not what i 'm used to when it comes to curry , i had to add some seasoning to it and heat it up longer than normal to make it thicker . I think this would be my only purchase .	-1
I wanted to like the three flavors of these I ordered ... ... ... but , I just can not enjoy them . They taste nothing like the fine Indian food I enjoy eating out . In fact the after taste reminds me of any food that is old . Will not order again . Two stars because they tried .	-1
When I look at the label it says 5 % truffle so 95 % salt . It smells mostly like salt . It looks mostly white , with specks of dark spots . So you are basically paying for the salt . Like someone said I would need at least 10 % .I do not like the real thing concentrated but this is not enough . I would have to add some myself . It tastes OK if you like salt .	-1
When I opened the jar I could n't help but say 'WOW ' . The truffle smell was great . Unfortunately after a few weeks the smell is gone , replaced with a terrible mixture of rancid chocolate and burnt rubber.I have a deep suspicion that this does not contain any truffle at all , just truffle scent and filler , with the scent having petered out very quickly . We bought a truffle salt from Dean and Deluca and it lasted far far longer , and the taste and smell was much more prominent than in this one.Very disappointed !	-1
We used to drink this all of the time - for years - then it disappeared . When I found a box I was thrilled ! Until I brewed it ... Celestial Seasonings changed the recipe and added peppermint ! Seriously ? ! ? ! So instead of that lovely bright flavor we remember so fondly you get something that tastes like liquid chewing gum - yuck . Our family is not fond of mint teas . Guess we are back to SV Teas until CS ( HOPEFULLY ) change it back .	-1
Although I like many of Celestial Seasonings Herbal varieties , I was not impressed with this green tea blend at all . My personal hunch is that the reason is not necessarily the quality of the starting products , but the way in which the tea is packaged . While most of us can and do applaud CS 's concern for the environment , unfortunately tea is prone to readily absorb whatever essences it is in the close vicinity of ( even the fragrances of orchids or peach blossoms carried on the wind are infused in the new tea buds as they begin to open ) , so if the tea is not tightly sealed , the leaves go stale and flat quickly , plus they become tainted by the packaging materials ( such as paper and cardboard ) . So I would appeal to Celestial Seasonings to either abandon their paper-like pouch and folded wax paper bag , or abandon tea ( camellia that is ) altogether , because when one deeply inhales from this package of tea , the nostril is quickly inundated not with the fresh , garden aroma of quality tea leaves , but with the distinct fragrance of cardboard.Steeped in the cup according to recommendations , the experience does not improve much . Although the liquor is a deep , golden-greenish color , it is quite thin to the taste , strongly astringent ( even soapy ) , flat , lacking body and character , and unenjoyable . I tried to give it a little more oomph by using two pouches instead of one per cup , but even that did not seem to have a noticeable impact . It tasted nearly the same ! It is also still several months from its expiration date , so that should n't be the problem . I would like to note that adding a touch of sweetener and cream did help round off the rough edges and mellow the flavor out , but the liquor was still not strong enough to hold its own , and it thus took on more of a watered down character.I have tried a few other green and white tea varieties , and I should say that I 'm not as wild about green tea as the fermented blacks , but there have been some that took me by surprise , such as Good Earth 's Lemongrass Green Tea , which I highly recommend if you want a more robust green tea experience . I so really enjoy that tea , since it has an immense amount of body , is well-balanced , and has a fresh , rich , playful character that embodies a warm summer day . However , in contrast , I found this selection by CS to be quite boring unfortunately , and I 'm sorry to say . Nevertheless , it is drinkable , so I will probably finish the box , if only for the health benefits .	-1
I have been drinking tea for years . This particular blend of green and white tea by the folks at Celestial Seasonings is quite possibly the worst cup of tea I have ever had . Green tea naturally has a grassy kind of taste to it , but it is very light and hidden behind the smooth , sweet , and slightly bitter taste the rest of the flavor produces . I love the taste of a solid green tea , however this is anything but . I do n't know what exactly went wrong with this blend of green and white , but the final product remains consistant no matter how many times I try to give CS a chance to prove it was just a bad batch I have recieved . The smoothness and slightly sweet flavor is totally gone and you are left with nothing , NOTHING but bitter grass . I am not a particularly picky tea drinker folks , I can tell you of the kind I have had which is better than the others , but I still can find enjoyment in most teas I consume . This particular brand is just totally unpleasing to the pallet in every way and there is no way I can possibly recommend you avoid it enough .	-1
This decaf green , like every other brand I 've tried so far , is not green in color and is missing that light , fresh , `` green '' flavor of a good caffeinated Japanese-style tea . I 'd say it is actually a bit smoky , sort of like a Chinese-style green tea , which is not what I 'm looking for . I like smoky green teas , like Hojicha , but I do n't like that flavor in plain green tea . I 've drunk green tea my whole life and tried many kinds from restaurants , groceries and Asian markets , and this one just does n't do it for me . It was surprising given the glowing reviews at Amazon that influenced my decision to buy it . So far Stash 's decaf has been the best , but I 'll keep searching for better .	-1
IF YOU 'RE SOY SENSITIVE LIKE ME BE AWARE THAT THIS AND OTHER HIBISCUS TEAS BY CELESTIAL SEASONINGS HAVE SOY LECITHIN . IT MAY NOT BE LISTED ON THE WEB BUT WHEN YOU GET IT IN THE MAIL AND READ THE INGREDIENTS ON THE BOX THERE IT IS , SOY LECITHIN . SOY LECITHIN DOES N'T MAKE ME ITCH AS MUCH AS SOYBEAN OIL OR SOY PROTEIN BUT IF I WANT TO GET AN ITCH FREE GOOD NIGHT 'S SLEEP I STAY CLEAR OF IT .	-1
The `` most critical '' review says : Do not buy for the Cranberry Apple and Tangerine Orange ! The picture and description is NOT accurate for this product as the shipped package replaces Cranberry Apple and Tangerine Orange with Wild Berry and True Blueberry ! - - -A few years back I bought a box of 6 packages of the Fruit Tea Sampler and it was different . As stated above , they have now replaced two of the flavors with cheaper fare . I looked at the graphic before ordering a few days ago and it said 18 tea bags . I wondered how they could do this . What I got before was 5 flavors , 4 tea bags each . Yes , 5 times 4 = 20 . How did they get 5 flavors and only 18 tea bags ? Well , I found out today when I received the package , the obvious fact being that two of the flavors only have 3 tea bags , being two of the better flavors , Raspberry Zinger and Country Peach Passion . Doh !	-1
I 'm glad I bought the sampler instead of individual boxes because I did n't particularly like any of them . The flavor of each is pretty weak .	-1
Nice spicy tea -- but I wanted a chocolate caramel tea ! Ca n't taste any chocolate and the bit of caramel flavor is drowned out by the strong spiciness . I wo n't buy this flavor again .	-1
I love this brand of teas but this version is more of a spice tea than a sweet tea . Not my cup of tea ! But if you like spicy teas then this is for you .	-1
These have a great mild flavor but I 've recently read celestial seasonings is using a higher than acceptable amount of pesticides in their tea leaves .	-1
It 's a below average rooibos red tea , which is still priced to make it a great deal . Go for this tea if you are a deal hunter . Not recommend for a true tea lover .	-1
I love tea . I was so excited to try this , because of health benefits , as well as the supposedly delicious taste . I bought the whole case with the intention of enjoying some myself and giving some as presents . The reviews were so positive , and I thought the vanilla would have to make it wonderful no matter what . But , I was wrong . To my taste , this tea is awful . It 's nearly tasteless ( which I do not consider a benefit in tea ) , but what I did taste was n't very nice . After one cup , I threw away the box I 'd opened and put the unopened boxes where people could take them if they wanted . I would n't have given it to anyone as a gift .	-1
After reading the review by `` That Chatty Gal '' I have to agree with her . I really wanted to like this tea . What 's better than Madagascar Vanilla and Tea ? I love both so this seemed like a wonderful choice . Unfortunately for me , the tea smelled like tobacco ( good tobacco if that matters ! ) but had a syrupy sweet taste and no real depth of flavor . I also tried it with soymilk , honey , sugar , milk , and both cold and iced . Still , I was unable to even drink one cup because I just did n't find this to be a pleasant experience . I used about half of the box trying to make it work , but it didn't.On the other hand , my children really enjoy this tea so I think this is one of the teas that you either love or hate . As for me , I 'll stick with Celestial Seasonings Chai teas if I 'm in the mood for a sweet tea with milk and sugar .	-1
I wanted to love this tea . The reviews here were so motivating . I was seeking a tea I could drink daily with no caffeine , that also would not upset my sensitive stomach . Rooibos sounded like the answer . However , I absolutely am repulsed by the smell ( both out of the box and after tea is infused ) , as well as by the taste and after-taste . I wish I loved it - I love the benefits it is supposed to have for health - but I loathe drinking it . I tried it ( 1 ) straight and hot ( 2 ) with sugar ( 3 ) with sugar and milk . All were horrible . It tastes strangely fruity - but there is an earthy taste that I just ca n't place that rises up and fills your senses . The aftertaste is like an artificial fruity taste , maybe artificial vanilla . Oh my it is awful . The color is quite pretty - it looks like a cup of pumpkin pie when you add milk - but I just ca n't down this beverage . Maybe if you like herbals as a rule that are fruity - you will like this beverage . I on the other hand love the flavor of black or green teas . I tolerate the taste of chamomile and peppermint . But this is just too much to ask . No rooibos for me . Sorry !	-1
I bought this tea on a whim thinking it would be perfect for this autumn and winter . When I opened the box , the smell was fantastic . I had such high hopes for this tea , but was sorely disappointed . It was much too sweet for me . I was expecting something that was heavily spiced , but it seems like the apple flavor is more prominent.I did n't want it to go to waste , so I experimented , trying different things in hopes that my taste buds would be satisfied . I tried steeping it for a short period of time , making iced tea , adding a splash of milk , adding more cinnamon , etc . Nothing seemed to do it for me . I really wanted to like this tea , because it smells so great , but I guess I 'll be on the look-out for something else .	-1
I bought this about a year ago and remember being so disappointed in the flavor , that I never bought it again . It seems that a lot of these cheap teas , taste like dirt . Not that I remember ever eating dirt , but that is what comes to mind when I taste it . I think this company uses a lot of raisen/prune juice to cover it up . That is the flavor that overpowers many of these teas , as well as cinnamon and anise , in some . People who like fruit cake might like it . I 'm not one of them . I do n't remember specifics about this flavor except that the picture is false advertising . The luscious orange flavor was only hinted at . The taste did not inspire me to try any of the other flavors , but prior to that , I did find one called Tuscany , that by itself had too much cinnamon . But on a hunch , I added it to Carnation Instant cocoa ( with the marshmellows ) and it was fantastic ! One good thing I can say is that I appreciate the wax paper packaging . Shiny metallic paper used in Bigelow and Twinings , I think , adds a metallic taste .	-1
The serial labels on the boxes says it is dark berry cherry but the box is the green tea raspberry version . It must be replacement for cherry BEWARE .	-1
I bought this with serveral other teas because soda has gotten too expensive . We make tea by the gallon and then put them in the frig . This saves a lot of money as there are 9 people in our household . This tea does have a very nice flavor but you have to hunt for it . All-in-all I will not buy it again because it is just too weak .	-1
Did n't do anything for me except give my heartburn . Gave it to some friends , they love love it .	-1
I have drank Bigelow band peppermint tea and loved it . But , by current supermarket does n't carry Bigelow 's peppermint tea and I figured how different can they be..after all the ingredients on both is `` Peppermint '' . I was very surprised to find Celestial Seasonings peppermint tea is very weak tasting . I am using two tea bags just to get more flavor . Also , there is a subtle difference in the taste of the two teas . Bigelow 's brand has a slightly sweeter taste , which I enjoy . In the future I will not be purchasing Celestial Seasonings peppermint tea .	-1
The past six months I 've been trying all the zinger teas available on Amazon ( after learning about the high antioxidants found in Hibiscus tea ) . This is definitely my least favorite ( FYI , the Tangerine Orange is my favorite ) .I should mention that I 've been using these teas as iced tea . This particular flavor is definitely more suited to be a hot tea . Even then , the apple flavor is very faint , and the cinnamon flavor seems stale to me . Not sure that 's the right wording - the cinnamon flavor tastes a lot like the flavor in cinnamon gum , rather than the cinnamon flavor in a pastry or something . I hope that makes sense .	-1
I love peppermint , so my sweet husband bought a box of this tea to try . Unfortunately , he did not realize how much I dislike spearmint , which is also in this tea.What really ruins the flavor of Mint Magic , however , is the other ingredients -- roasted chicory , cinnamon and orange peel . In combination with more robust teas , chicory is a nice , nutty additive . Cinnamon and orange peel are wonderful with fruity teas , but not with mint . These ingredients change the tea from a refreshing , cool flavor , to something more warm and spicy . Clearly , they do n't go together !	-1
I have been using Bigelow Thai Chi and once tied Twinnings , both were good , thought I was buying the Twinning , but not so . It was just not to my liking . Not a big tea drinker . Use the Thai Chi tea with powered sugarfree vanilla coffee creamer . For me , it is hot and has a nice flavor . I am not , a tea lover . This brand did not work for me .	-1
I 'm a South Asian , I know how real , true chai is made . That being said , this chai is overwhelming with the clove flavor . Authentic spice chai includes cardamon ( lots of it ) and this is lacking in that . There is an extremely subtle coconut flavor but it 's barely there . Overall I hate this stuff . It 's way to heavy on the clove taste and light on everything else .	-1
I am a big fan of the high quality of Celestial Seasonings products and their usually good tea blends . This particular blend does not make the cut . I want to like it but somehow the coconut does not really work in this tea . The aroma is artificial coconut , and the flavor is a strange somewhat musty coconut flavor without noticable chai spice . Drinkable but an eccentric blend -- perhaps a diehard coconut lover would find this appealing.Celestial Seasonings gets extra points for their packaging : they utilize 100 % natural recycled paperboard in their boxes and they do n't package each tea bag individually . Instead they use a system of a waxed paper bag inside the box that stays shut when you fold it . It keeps the bags fresh and utilizes less packaging than individually wrapping each bag . The art they use on each box is beautiful as are the quotes and information they put on every surface.Quote from the box : '' Love the moment and the energy of that moment will spread beyond all boundaries . '' Corita Kent .	-1
I really am shocked at how bad this tea is for two reasons:1 . I 've bought LOTS of Celestial Seasonings products and have for years . Normally I like most of them well enough to buy again but this one tastes really hideous to me . Undrinkable.2 . How can you possibly ruin green tea ? ? ? ? If you 're drinking green tea for the catechins then I read that this is one of the better ones on the American market ( a close second is Lipton brand ) so if you can gag this stuff down then at least there is that benefit ( or so I read ) .Unfortunately I now have 5+ packs of this to use . I find that putting several of the tea bags in with my regular tea while brewing a gallon does n't adversely affect the taste of my iced tea so I 'll try to use it up that way .	-1
Ii was very disappointed in these teas . I like lots of different ones , but these did not move me , except the peppermint .	-1
I was n't expecting such an overpowering of orange peel . I really ca n't taste any vanilla or honey , and that 's what I was aiming for .	-1
Not a fresh lemon taste at all . Reminds me of lemon cleaner in scent , especially . I really like their orange tangerine zinger so I thought I would like this one - not so !	-1
the color is hibiscus and os listed as first ingredient . I actually bought it because I use hibiscus tea to lower blood pressure , and I am used to the sour taste.It is deceitful to call it blueberry when only the flavoring is used and is actually the last ingredient listed .	-1
This tea definitely smelled like blueberries but upon tasting it , it was a very sour /bitter taste to me despite not over steeping the tea . It almost tasted like cough syrup . added a bit of organic sugar and it tasted a bit better . Maybe I Just do n't like herbal / fruit flavored teas .	-1
I bought this for a co-worker in the office and tried it , I have to say that I am not sold on the sugar replacements on taste or health - I still believe that these are n't great for you . The sugar-in-the-raw is the best in my opinion .	-1
My mom bought this as the alternative to sugar and loves using it all the time in her coffee . Me , I believe it 's just okay , but leaves a horrible after taste . I tried using it many times , hoping I would acquire the taste , but it just did n't come at all . It even makes the coffee I drink have a weird after taste as well . Judging by the reviews , people like this stuff , me I just stick to regular sugar or Equal , because it tastes better than the Splenda .	-1
Sugar is n't good for you either , but Spenda is REALLY not good for you , it 's not even a food ! When I found this out I actually called them and told them I was irritated and that I felt misled . I gave away my Splenda and have n't touched it since I found out about it .	-1
I do n't really like the taste of Splenda , and I do n't think it dissolves well in cold drinks , like iced tea . This is probably my least favorite sweetener .	-1
I STOPPED USING THIS WHEN I FINALLY STOPPED AND READ THE LABEL . I DO NOT HAVE A DESIRE TO BE LOADED WITH PLASTIC IN MY SYSTEM .	-1
I 'm on a diet where I 'm watching what I eat and limiting my sugar consumption . I thought about buying this again to add to my tea since I love tea but It 's hard for me to drink tea without any form of sweetener . I decided to do some research before I pushed the purchase button with the coupon that Amazon had making this purchase only $ 8.99 ( A bargain ) It did n't take long for me to find out the truth about this stuff `` Just like aspartame , which achieved marketplace approval by the Food and Drug Administration when animal studies clearly demonstrated its toxicity , sucralose also failed in clinical trials with animals . Aspartame created brain tumors in rats . Sucralose has been found to shrink thymus glands ( the biological seat of immunity ) and produce liver inflammation in rats and mice '' Splenda/sucralose is simply chlorinated sugar ; a chlorocarbon . Common chlorocarbons include carbon tetrachloride , trichlorethelene and methylene chloride , all deadly . Chlorine is nature 's Doberman attack dog , a highly excitable , ferocious atomic element employed as a biocide in bleach , disinfectants , insecticide , WWI poison gas and hydrochloric acid.I think I 'll pass and just watch my sugar consumption and maybe I 'll gradually get used to using less and less sugar . The US already has an abnormally high Cancer rate compared to the rest of the world and I 'm sure products like this are n't helping .	-1
Sorry but I just did not care for the taste of this product . I went back to my favorite artificial sweetener .	-1
I have been using Splenda off and on since it became available to consumers . During that time when I am using the most Splenda I get insomnia , tired eyes , sleepy during the day , and excessive weight gain . I was taking an average of 8-10 packets per day . After checking out the web site called splenda exposed dot com I found out I am not the only one with these problems . I am going back to Stevia , which I have used in the past . It 's not an artifical sweetener , it 's all natural from a plant grown in South America and tastes nearly identical to sugar in a similar intensity to the sweetness of Splenda . From what I have read , Splenda has arsenic in it which is poisonous and the chemical structure of Splenda is known to have caused numerous problems in insect and animal studies . Although I do enjoy the flavor of Splenda immensely and love the thought of reducing calories I am not sure the end result is the desired result . If you try stevia I have found Sweet Leaf brand to be unpleasant but I really love the flavor of Stevita Stevia , it tastes just like sugar . Unfortunately , Stevia 's sweetness does not hold up in hot beverages or baking but works very well in cold foods and beverages .	-1
I gave up using sugar as a sweetener over 10 yrs ago , but because I have a nagging sweet tooth & am not happy without sweetness in my life , I thought Splenda was the answer & used it to sweeten all my coffee & tea beverages , etc . When I started using it , it was recommended as a sweetener by Dr Atkins ( low-carb diet guru ) & was used in Canada for 20 yrs before it was approved in USA . It all sounded good to me & I enjoyed using it . Over the yrs I was happy to see more & more pre-packaged foods being sweetened with Splenda ( or sucralose ) instead of aspartame ( NutraSweet ) or other chemical sweeteners like Sweet n ' Low.My happy use of Splenda came to an abrupt halt when I learned that Splenda , which is made of natural sugar that is chemically altered to not be absorbed by the body ( hence making it calorie-free ) through chlorinization . Chlorine is a thyroid function inhibitor or disruptor . Low thyroid problems already run in my family & I had long been having chronic symptoms of thyroid deficiency despite my blood test numbers being in the `` normal '' range ( hence my MD would not treat it ) . Little did I know I was further harming my already vulnerable thyroid with Splenda ! I literally used it daily for 10 straight years . I used to think that Splenda seemed too good to be true & unfortunately for me that 's how it turned out . I have since switched to liquid stevia from the healthfood store to sweeten my decaf & not only am I taking nutritional precautions to care for my thyroid but am also on thyroid medication as well ( Armour Thyroid by prescription ) . My low-thyroid symptoms are unrelenting , especially cold intolerance , low energy , quick fatigue , & loss of outer eyebrows.I loved Splenda while I was ignorant of its potential negative effects . For people who do n't have thyroid issues , I would n't say this is a bad product , & I 'd still say it 's better than consuming sugar which is the worse evil in my opinion . But for thyroid conditions , I recommend staying away from Splenda/sucralose . It 's bad enough we have chlorinated city water to drink ( please use a water filter system or pitcher like Brita ) . Fluoride is bad for thyroid too , so I 've switched to fluoride-free toothpaste . What an environment we live in !	-1
Product arrived as advertised and has performed very well . I would , however , not recommend this product at the price on Amazon . I found a much better deal at COSTCO . I would have returned it but would have to pay too much for shipping .	-1
I dont even know why people still buy this crap . Its not made from sugar and no it doesnt taste like sugar . Thats misleading ! Splenda is made by man by bonding to molecules of chlorine to 1 molecule of sucrose ( LEMONS ) and then its ground down to a fine sugar like consistancy ! SPLENDA IS BS ! BUY STEVIA !	-1
makes moldy , horrid wheatgrass prone to rotting and fruit flies . Maybe I got a bad batch . I also grew it hydro . I never had this problem with my wheat grass seeds from mountain rose herbs .	-1
I do n't know where these rave reviews are coming from . Zotz is disgusting . I tried one not knowing what it was and was disgusted when this thick , sour foam was coming out of the candy . Did not taste or feel good in my mouth . BLECH .	-1
Thanks for the egg tip , it works very well and really helps this product . Nevertheless , I ended up giving away three of the six containers because I was not thrilled with the nutritional information .	-1
I tried these as I love Thai food , ginger and coconut . That was my problem , as this mess does not even vaguely resemble Thai food and has no discernible ginger or coconut taste . Plus , the noodles stick together , even when prepared as suggested , and come out in a big clump when you try to eat them.Also , the nutrition label is misleading . I am dieting and read labels very carefully . This says a serving is one cup and also says one package weighs 4oz ( half a cup ) . I figured , as it did not say otherwise and as this type of meal is usually one serving , that after adding water there would be one serving per package . Not so , one package is actually two servings , or over 500 calories . This is far more than any other pre-packaged noodle meal I have seen.The excessive calorie content might have been OK had the product tasted good , but it does n't . I would definitely recommend you stay away from this mess .	-1
We enjoy A Taste of Tai 's Peanut Noodles ... they rock . That peanutty flavor ... mmm ... so we decided to try these ... um , Ginger , not so much . Nothing really distinguishes these from any other noodle flavor , and the ginger is a bit overpowering.Take this review in stride though , if you 're a Ginger lover ( and I 'm not talking Gilligan 's Island here ) , then these may be right up your alley . Just a bit outside for me , though ( if I may mix my metaphors ) .	-1
Meh . That 's a good way of describing this tea . Just , meh . It was n't horrible but it was n't anything I 'd go rushing out to the store to buy again either.Peaches , Ginger , sweetness ; there is a whole lot of seemingly good flavors that could end up in this tea . Just the peaches alone would have done that . But sadly , I did not taste any of it . Well , maybe the sweetness until it grew tepid . While it had a wonderful smell where you could definitely detect the ginger , it simply did n't have any flavor . I might as well have been drinking slightly bitter water . Which is a problem I 've run into with other flavors for this brand . And letting it steep for longer did n't help either . It just made it get more and more bitter . Which is the same thing that letting it cool did as well . This is definitely a tea you want to drink hot.And it 's a shame because for a non-organic tea , this one actually has decent ingredients . Ceylon and Assam Tea , Ginger Root and Peach Flavor . That 's it . And while it could be debated that peach flavor does n't really signify a whole lot , I 'm impressed that it is a short list . And in theory , this tea bag was enough to flavor a standard 8oz glass of water . Well , maybe not so much flavor but it did turn the water tea colored.I have to say that based on my experience with two of these teas from Revolution ( and one waiting for me to try tomorrow that I 'm now wary about ) I would n't recommend them to anyone who actually likes to taste their tea . There just simply is n't enough flavor . But hey , at least they come in individual packs in addition to multiple packs . So you can buy one , try it , and if you do n't like it you 're not stuck with a bunch of tea bags.Review by M. Reynard 2013	-1
This does not taste like any brown sugar I have had in the past , it just was not very good . Also it was as hard as a brick I have to used a knife and chop it up every time I want to cook witch it just to get it in the measuring cup . It 's impossible to & # 34 ; pack & # 34 ; it in the measuring cup once you finally get it there . Makes a huge mess . Disappointing .	-1
It is hard as a rock and almost impossible to use for anything that has to be measured . The taste is fine but that does n't matter if you ca n't use it .	-1
I 'm used to buying muscavado ( like ) sugars in europe . This product was dry and almost unusable even with a great deal of effort to reconstitute . I 've used this brand before and it was fine , but i believe it comes from the UK and perhaps the transit is just too much or its been sitting in some wherehouse too long . I 'd say buyer beware buying this product . Every box in my case was like a hard rock .	-1
My sugar arrived just fine , but when i opened a box i found the sugar to be literally as hard as a rock and not usuable . Yes , i know i can put a moist cloth over the top , try microwaving , blah blah blah but my time is way more valuable that than . the light brown sugar i ordered was fine , and the dark brown i ordered from another manufacturer was great . so word to the wise , you get what you pay for and i ca n't recommend this product ( I threw mine out ) .	-1
I would n't buy the seeds unless you plan on grinding them yourself ( I tried this and broke a hand blender doing so ) . THEY say the seeds do n't digest properly . I would go for the flaxseed meal .	-1
I really want to love this flour . Bob 's Red Mill usually makes such great products ! This flour has a very distinct unpleasant taste . I have used it to make pizza and baked goods and unfortunately the horrible taste always comes through . I prefer to use a mix of gluten free flours instead .	-1
New to the GF world as of 12/10 . Already tired of the bad taste and smell from GF flours . Bob 's Red Mill products are so easy to find that of course it was the first one I purchased and tried . Using a mixture of this flour with some salt and pepper for dusting chicken turned out really well . Next I tried using it in muffins and biscuits as I would have my old non-gluten free flours . Horrible . I have been doing a lot of research into this and find it to be products that contain fava beans or other bean flours are just not right for substituting for your old non-gf flour . I just tried Pamela 's and loved it , as close to the old way things tasted before being diagnosed .	-1
I purchased this flour to make a quick , gluten-free biscuit recipe that a friend gave me and it has worked great for that recipe . Tonight , I decided to make a peanut-butter pie for my hubbie 's birthday . Feeling lazy , I used the all-purpose flour to make the pie crust ( instead of mixing my own flour mixture ... which I usually do ! ) . Well ... the garbanzo bean flour so many reviewers have complained about made the dough horribly bitter . I added some confectioner 's sugar to sweeten it . I ended up with a gooey mass of something that I plopped into a pan and baked so as not to waste it ! I had to start all over again and made a cereal crust instead . Double the trouble , double the mess ! THAT 's what I get for being lazy ! Anyway , the point is , this flour is great for breads , biscuits , rolls , and so forth , but NOT for anything sweet ! Do n't use it for your cakes , cookies , pie crusts , etc . You wo n't get the flavor you expect ! Perhaps it should be renamed , `` Some Purpose Flour ! '' Happy baking ! UPDATE : Originally , I emphasized that this flour is not for all purposes . Well , now it seems it is for no purpose at all because it is full of bugs ! I keep my flour in Lock 'n Lock containers and none of my other flours have suffered the same fate ( in the same cupboard ) . This leads me to believe that the little buggers were already in the flour when I got it ... I 'll be looking for another flour mix now !	-1
Bob 's Red Mill needs to stop making products with garbanzo bean flour for people who must not eat gluten . Most people with a gluten intolerance also have a soy intolerance . Bob 's Red Mill bread mix with garbanzo bean flour made me very ill . This company makes some great GF products . But , it is misleading people by not putting on its labels that garbanzo beans are in the soy family and if you need to avoid soy , do n't buy it .	-1
I bought a case of this and use about 1/3 of this along with rice , and soy flour . I dont like this mix at all . The beans gas up my husband so much he cant eat it and it has a strong taste . I get stomache cramps from it . I 'm on a gluten free diet and i like the other flours better than this one .	-1
I never imagined a brand name like Red Mill would sell anything with such a bad taste.Baking flour should be taste free .	-1
Always looking for good gluten free products , I tried this . I did not realize when I bought it that it was mostly garbanzo bean flour . I made some chocolate cookies that turned out fabulous , moist , firm , not crumbly . They did not have a `` beany '' taste but if I eat more than 1 cookie , which I do some times , look out ! I 've had some bad times with the pain , gas , and bloating that this product is causing.If you can tolerate the beans than I would recommend this flour but if you are like me , steer clear ! I now have 3 bags of the stuff that I need to give away to someone , ugh !	-1
I usually look at reviews before trying new GF products but I 've heard of Bob Mills and it seems to be talked a lot about on celiac eyc so I just went ahead and bought it . I was making curry chicken and wanted to make a gf roti and I had my apprehensions about its success but thought I 'd try anyway.I bought a small bag for close to 6 $ , very pricy for such a small bag but all gf products are expensive and I would deal with it if it was great tasting ... I gathered my ingredients to make my roti , my curry had been simmering for the last hour and I was looking forward to my dinner.I open the bag of flour and the first thing that I 'm hit by is an extremely foul odor , beany , strong and just plain disgusting . I continued with my dough abd finished my roti skins and the end result was not edible . The taste of bean is beyond present and I can not believe anything baked with this can be successful or come remotely close to tasting close toIt 's gluten counterpart.Expensive and truly disgusting ! ! Worst gluten free product I 've tried so far !	-1
I wish I could use this flour . I 'm new to gluten free and didnt think of the issues `` bean flour '' could cause . The taste is fine and the banana bread recipe on the bag is wonderful UNTILL its digested . We all had horrible gas pains . I tried it in a couple of recipes but our systems just could n't adjust . I had to throw the rest of the bag away .	-1
I love Bob 's Red Mill and as a gluten-intolerant person , am very thankful for their products . Over time since I 've GF I 've learned that some GF flours taste funky , sour or just plain nasty . Garbanzo bean flour fits the bill . It is so overpowering . Other than that the texture of the baked goods using this mix is good . Just be aware of the garbanzo flour , it 's a bit much . My search is still on for a good GF baking mix .	-1
When my hubby realized he had to eat gluten free , this was one of the first products I tried , because it was available locally . VERY disappointed , I can tell you ! The baked goods were nothing like I expected , and the beany smell and taste was very off-putting.The bread I made with it collapsed a few minutes out of the oven ( as it cooled ) and was inedible once cold . The good news is I let it dry out , crumbled it up and used it for breading on baked chicken.I gave up on baked goods for a long while . Then recently I bought `` Gluten Free on a Shoestring '' and she recommended Better Batter mixes . They are much pricier but taste like the baked goods I am used to . Arrowhead also makes a mix that is reasonably priced and not beany.Given how poorly this product performs and how off-putting the beany-ness is , I 'm hoping they reformulate it to make it more appealing.Bob 's Mill makes many great products , but I do n't care much for this one . Perhaps there are recipes where it shines ; I have n't found any of them .	-1
I have tried it a couple times and fine I can only use it in savory dishes . Not at all for baking . There is an odd taste to items I have baked . Cookies , pie crust , etc are not good . There is also a grainy fill to items I have cooked using it . I fine I prefer King Arthur .	-1
I just received this not even 10 minutes ago and when I went to open the package , there was white powder everywhere inside the packaging itself . 3 bags were fine but 1 bag had a big gash in the side of it .	-1
I use dates in my oatmeal and these are the worst ones I have ever tasted.The oat flour coating is definitely not a light dusting , and the flavor is only OK.Also , the pieces range in size from the tiniest speck to a big chunk.However , I think these could be good in date nut bread , and other baked goods .	-1
I often buy Bob 's Red Mill ... however , this mix is not good at all . I do n't know what happened or who approved this , but the biscuits turned out like rocks . They were dry and hard and that was even when warm . They were worse when they cooled . They also had a nasty after-taste.I hate to say it , but I ended up throwing out the batch I made and throwing out the mix after them.If someone from Bob 's Red Mill reads these reviews ... please revamp this mix and I will be happy to try it again !	-1
These were the absolutely worst biscuits I have ever made ( flavor-wise ) . I never write reviews but wanted to help someone save their money . A much better gluten free biscuit mix is the 1 2 3 Southern Glory brand . Light and delicious . Even as dumplings the Bob 's Mill biscuits were terrible .	-1
Initialy I rated this product five stars ( but read the rest of the review ) . ( Moreover , I then gave it three stars , but , regrettably , even that was too much , as I eventually discovered . ) I just got the second shipment of this stuff -- it seems great ( so far : and I 'll update this review if I have anything new to say , good OR bad ) . Both times it came very fast , packaged well ( in a cardboard box holding four plastic bags , each holding over half a kilo of these seeds ) . The quality seems very good , good taste.I add these seeds to oatmeal , and actually , just eat them straight quite a bit : I just walk around with a bag in one hand and a spoon in the other : - ) . Unlike flax seeds ( which are nothing special ) , sunflower seeds are really tasty , so I have to stop myself from finishing off a whole bag in one sitting.I used to buy them in our store here , but those are salted and fried , so I figured one day , I get a ton of salt every time I gorge on those seeds , so I googled for unprocessed seeds , and lo and behold , Amazon has them ( at a better price too ) . I 've never bought food here , but this turned out to be a very easy option , no-hassle quick delivery : one day you simply find your order on your porch ... the stuff is n't easily perishable , so that works fine . I got ta say , as much as I detest Amazon 's obvious love of fake five-star reviews from publishers ' shills , when it comes to variety and order fulfillment , they 're very good , addictive really.I see some reviewers mention another supplier of these seends -- thanks for that ; this is something to try in the future . For now all I can say , Red Bob 's sunflower seeds seem ( taste ) pretty good to me . Supposedly they 're very healthful , but even if it 's all hype , they taste good enough to eat them just for that . And of course , if you do n't like them raw , you can fry them yourself , w/o a lot of ( or any ) salt.01/08/2011 : I 'm on my third refill now , and I 'd like to issue a warning : a couple of packs contained real hard bits , something you could break your teeth on . Very rarely , but still . I fished one out to see what these thingies look like , but they 're really undistinguishable from the normal seeds : same form , size , and colour . This taught me not to chomp too heavily ... I 'll get one more refill : if this is an isolated phenomenon , OK ; but if not , I 'll drop the brand . Otherwise all 's good though , great stuff.02/16/2011 : Refill seems fine , no hard particles.04/08/2011 : I have to bring the stars down : every fourth or fifth bag has slivers of shells and small solid particles amongst the seeds . Shells , at least , can be picked out visually , but the solids are the same colour and size as the seeds ( impossible to discern , though their shape is slightly different , more squarish ) so there 's a serious risk of chipping a tooth -- a bad bargain , imo . Mostly these seeds are good , but now and then there 's a bad bag . Not sure how to deal with this ... I like these seeds , but then I like my teeth too . Will probably give up this product.05/25/2011 : Yeah , I quit buying it . Hopefully I can find another brand that 's not as dangerous for my teeth ! : - ) I 'm buying a number of products from this `` Red Bob '' outfit , and I 'm happy with them all except this one -- I think the company needs to concentrate on quality control ( instead of jacking up the cost : I just noticed when posting this that the stuff went up quite a bit , like fifty percent -- dear maker , as it is , it 's not good at any price if you value your teeth . And btw , loose sunflower seeds , unprocessed , are available in stores , for example at Wegmann 's for three-ninety-nine a pound , Whole Foods for two-ninety-nine a pound , and Trader Joe 's for the amazing buck-forty-nine a pound -- and you do n't have to get five pounds to get this price.. be watchful about prices , always : observing this site I see many items go up by the mind-blowing thirty-to-fifty percent overnight ... somehow my salary does n't go up like that , 'specially in the midst of a recession , um , sorry I forgot it ended two years ago , purportedly ) .	-1
This is five pounds of seeds with oil which will go rancid quickly even if you keep it in freezer . It is sold for more money than USDA certified organic sunflower seeds which is very confusing to me especially when I can buy conventional sunflower seeds , raw , unsalted in 16oz sealed containers only for $ 1.99 at my local TJ which are fresh and great tasting due to their high sales volume.I consume many seeds and nuts and sunflower seed offers magnesium , copper , selenium and many other nutrients but is the king in few nutrients like ; 1 . The highest amount of vitamin E in any seed or nut 15.3 mg , 76 % DV % in only 46gr serving size,2 . One of the highest Phytosterols 534mg in comparison to sesame seed 714mg for one cup of serving,3 . Freshness is extremely important since the seeds will go rancid very quickly , infact much quicker than majority of other seeds due to the oil in the seeds,4 . I consume raw seeds , not roasted or salted,5 . I keep it in dark , sealed container and frozen,6 . Freshness=Nutritious=Delicious ; I consume lots of seeds , beans , grains , vegetables , etc . and freshness is a priority regardless of the brand so I always purchase my food ingredients in small quantities from reputable sellers with high turn over . When fresh it is nutritious and that goes for any food item in any form , from frozen to canned . When fresh it is nutritious and delicious since fresh nutrients give food its delicious taste . When old or rancid , nutrients are gone and any food item becomes an empty calories with no taste and absolutely worthless,7 . FAT : The most important hormone , and the one that 's crucial for weight loss , is insulin . Insulin is the hormone that controls fat storage . A high-carb diet increases the amount of glucose in the bloodstream , which in turn means you produce more insulin . The more insulin the body produces , the more fat gets stored . A low-carb diet means less insulin , making it easier to lose weight because less fat is then stored .

If calorie is calorie , then in my case and my experience shows that I would prefer to get my calories from a healthy fat from sesame seed and almond than the calories from the carbs in chia . Almonds have the highest fat calories from all the seeds and nuts and that is a priority to me in type of calories since I am kind of vegan who consumes fish but hardly any meat or chicken.Accordingly for 28gr/1oz servings size of ; Amaranth__quinoa__flax__peanut__almonds__chia__sesame__sunflower__cashew__pistachioTOTAL CALORIES28.6__33.6__ 150__166__161__137__160__162__155__156CALORIES FROM CARBS21.2__23.6__33__28.9__24.6__50__26.8__31.2__34.4__31.8CALORIES FROM FAT3.7__4.8__98.8__121__116__72.1__116__112__103__104CALORIES FROM PROTEIN3.7__4.9__17.8__16.8__20.6__15.2__17.2__19.1__17.7__20For almost the same total calories sesame offers half of chia 's `` CARB CALORIES '' gain but 50 % more `` FAT CALORIES '' with high amount of nutrients for weight loss . Sesame is my superfood but almonds are the superfood when it comes to fat calories and vitamin E.

I was n't thrilled because I had to pick out tiny bits of gravel . The flax seeds themselves were fine , top quality . If it were n't for the gravel bits ( that get through the sieve w/the seeds , I guess ? ) , this would get 5 stars .	-1
I 'm not sure what convinced other people to give this product such high ratings . Maybe other gluten-free mixes are worse ? But after trying this cake , I have come to the conclusion that garbanzo bean flour has NO place in cake mix . Falafel mix , yes . Cake mix , never again . I am going to make my own gluten-free cake with rice flour and whatever else I can find . This is okay if you plan to slather it with sweet toppings , like a big scoop of ice cream per slice , but as a plain piece of cake , not so good .	-1
I will start off saying that my wife loves this stuff but I hate it ! It is nothing more than dry oats and almond slivers in a bag . I am a huge fan of granola but not this stuff . The Bob 's Red Mill Apple Blueberry is where its at . That is the best stuff I have every had . Granola wise that is .	-1
This granola was not crunchy or clumpy enough to use as my family 's go to granola , but I can use it as an ingredient for other baked goods . Plus I did n't like that it was n't organic .	-1
Add me to the list of folks who does n't get the good reviews for these pancakes . They are not delicious . They have a strong corn texture ( sort of a cornbread pancake ) , they are extremely crumbly . They are dry . They are neither light nor fluffy and really barely even passable for pancakes . I added fresh blueberries to ours and that was the only saving grace . Really very not good and I wo n't buy this again.There are so many genuinely great GF mixes these days , I do n't know why Bob 's Red Mill could n't do a better job on this mix . 2 stars are just because they are easy and edible . Maybe I could have turned the mix into something good by making a million modifications , but that would n't really be a review for the pancakes made as the mix recommends , would it ? Though I am glad some people have found a way to make this mix better .	-1
I really do n't like these pancakes . They 're dry and tasteless . I hate rating one star but I ca n't help but severely dislike this product . There 's much better gluten free pancakes out there , bisquick , maple grove farms and a few others . Also smaller companies who do n't sell to large stores make good mixes , check out home goods speciality foods section for some good mixes .	-1
Just a word of warning ? Lots of celiacs have trouble with this -- it will depend on how sensitive you are to gluten . Bob 's Red Mill is probably legally gluten-free -- 20 ppm , or close to it -- but it makes enough people sick that you have to wonder.If you are still getting sick and you are eating this , or you are feeding this to a gluten-free kid who is still getting sick , either you and a substantial portion of celiacs on various websites are ultra-sensitive to the small amounts of gluten in this , or it 's not actually gluten-free .	-1
I have really bad cholesterol . This product is highly recommended for lowering high cholesterol , and may prevent clogged arteries to a degree . I can not comment on this however , since I have been unable to find my order of it anywhere . It has never been delivered to & # 34 ; me & # 34 ; , though it has supposedly been & # 34 ; sent & # 34 ; to me several times . I am disabled and can not drive far enough to find it . I live in a somewhat remote farm community . Guess I will keep my bad state of heart risk ! georgia	-1
You know how in China and Japan they mostly eat white rice but at the same time some really smart integrated health care professionals in America insist that brown rice would be healthier because it has more minerals , B vitamins and a lower glycemic index ? Well , maybe that 's a pile of noise.Maybe the people in Japan and China actually know what they 're doing this time ( just like pretty much every other time ) . Maybe the miniscule quantities of vitamins and minerals in brown rice are more than outweighed by allergens and other noxious things ( like cyanide ) in the bran , which help prevent baby rice grains in the wild from being devoured in the first place.On the other hand , I got ta say , it *does* taste good .	-1
It smells bland and tastes just plain bad . I regularly eat unsweetened and unflavored rolled oats but was unprepared for how bad these tasted . The raisins were old and dry and there seems to be sand-like stuff in there . I had to be careful when I bit down because I could never be sure when there 's sand in the bite It took.I depend on the feedback that Amazon buyers give on products , but wow , the feedback sure are off the mark on this product . A solid 5 stars from 72 reviews on this product ? Maybe someone 's stuff the polls on this one .	-1
I have never eaten flax before , and this last Saturday , I decided to add one teaspoon to my oatmeal . After the first couple of bites , my throat started to feel weird , and felt like it was going to close . With each bite , I started to feel worst and worst . After eating less than half of the oatmeal , I poured it out . I eat this oatmeal every day , plain , without flax . No problem . Next , I started feeling warm , my stomach was cramping , and I was puking . I never get sick like this ! ! I tried to call my doctor , but they were closed . Thought I was going to die .	-1
I found these beans to be nothing special . I found their flavor to be boring and bland compared to the best of other Cannellini beans I 've purchased in bulk from health food stores . On the positive side , the beans were big , plump , and fairly healthy ( many had crosswise deep cracks , which was not good ) and seemed fresh ( purchased 12/2009 and had `` best by '' date of 9/2011 ) . They cooked quickly , which is a sign of freshness , and they tasted fresh.But their flavor was bland ; some nice mineral notes , but just not very `` beany . '' There were also some slightly off earthy notes , which I did not care for . I also found their texture to be a bit grainy and not very creamy.I cooked them once with an overnight cold soak in a salt brine ( as recommended by Cook 's Illustrated to tenderize skins , which really works ) and once with a one-hour hot soak in brine ( Cook 's Illustrated 's recommended quick method ) . One time I cooked them on a very slow simmer to keep the beans whole ( which does sacrifice some creaminess ) , and once at a strong simmer to let the bean skins break open to maximize creaminess . But even this latter method failed to make them creamy -- unlike most white beans . I cook lots of dry beans and have many years of experience cooking beans , so how these beans turned out had nothing to do with how I cooked them . The best of other white beans I 've had cook up wonderfully creamy and flavorful . These beans were just far from the best .	-1
Now that I 'm stuck with 4 bags of this stuff , I 'm trying to muscle through it ( ca n't bring myself to throw it away ) ... but I really miss my old granola . This product is too sweet , and has another taste ( vanilla ? ) that I ca n't quite place but I find distracting from what should just be a good granola taste . On a positive side , it 's of good consistency and arrived tasting very fresh . But usually I just ca n't eat enough granola , and with this product I feel like I 'm taking medicine - it 's not tasty.I 'm mixing this in with cereal ... perhaps this granola would be better suited for baking . Sorry , I ca n't give this oatmeal my full endorsement .	-1
5/05/2010 Update . I am sorry but I have to down grade my review yet again . I found grit in this quinoa for the third time while eating today . I am shocked , I have never had this happen with quinoa before . Very unpleasant experience to be chewing and get that awful gritty sensation and sound between your teeth . It does n't happen every time so I guess there are clumps of it in areas of the bag of quinoa ? Now I 'm stuck with the remainder of this bag plus the three remaining bags I do n't know what to do . It 's too bad because the flavor of the quinoa is really good . *********I am on a gluten free , vegan , nut free diet and Quinoa is a very easy way to get protein so I eat it a lot and can not afford to pay a high price for it so , originally , I was so happy to find it here at a more affordable price than at Meijer . Quinoa is NOT cheap to buy anywhere that I can find here . When I bought this the other day I thought that it was a good deal but was disappointed to find that I had over paid . I will be going to Trader Joe 's in future where I have found quinoa that is just as good as Bob 's Red Mill and just as well washed but is over one dollar a pound cheaper . I might try the Eden Organics brand that Amazon carries , it is almost a dollar cheaper per pound , hopefully it wo n't have grit like Bob 's Red Mill.Bob 's Red Mill is really over charging on all their products . No need to be so greedy Bob 's Red Mill . So many products they sell , like dried chickpeas and chickpea flour , I can get for half the price or less from Patel Brothers Indian Grocers . Even Meijer has dried chickpeas for less than half the price of Bob 's . I will be canceling my Subscribe and Save on this product .	-1
I 've made two packages of this bread . Both made really ugly loaves , but that would n't have mattered if the bread tasted good . It did n't . In addition , it uses whole milk and eggs which make the bread pretty expensive .	-1
I love most Bob 's stuff , but I bought this bread mix and made rolls . I had two in one day and woke up with terrible stomach pains the next morning . As most of us who must stay gluten free do , I went over in my mind what I had had to eat the day before and these rolls were the only new thing . I then researched garbanzo beans . They are in the soybean family . My doctor has told me that I must also be careful of soy as well as milk unless it is lactose free . The garbanzo beans were the problem so I had to go to another brand with the other types of flour . If you do n't have a problem with soy , the rolls were very good . Wonderful taste and very soft . However , you may need to stay away from it if you are allergic to soy also .	-1
My family did not like the flavor of the bread . We are not gluten intolerant , but wanted to try to get away from glutens for awhile to see if it helped with my digestive issues . Just a real weird flavor . It rose up pretty well and looked good , just too beany of a flavor .	-1
I 've made several loaves of this bread . It definitely has that `` gluten-free '' taste and texture - not comparable to wheat bread at all . It also tends to rise too much during baking and then collapses somewhat during cooling . This creates an odd shaped slice of bread . I recently tried Pamela 's bread and it is great . I 'm waiting until I 've baked a few more loaves of it to give a final verdict , though ...	-1
Gross . The mix smelled bad . My sister tried some before I baked it and she spat it out and said the bread will taste bad also . I figured I might as well go through with baking it since I am so desperate to find a GF bread I can use . I took a pinch of the bread after it was cooked and it tasted as bad as it smelled . Now that I read the reviews , it 's presumably because it has all of these overpowering bean flours .	-1
The ones I received were mostly yellowish in color with some light green instead of dark green , dry and somewhat stale , they may have been in a warehouse longer that they should have !	-1
I make gluten-free bread and had been using xanthan gum as a binder , but I thought that I could substitute the guar gum , which is cheaper . My bread was falling apart when I attempted to pick it up . The bread left a slimy film on my tongue , and it was making me cough.I wanted to buy less , but the 3 bag purchase was not available . Now I have almost eight full bags of guar gum that I need to find a use for .	-1
I did n't realize how good Trader Joe 's almond flour was until I tried this brand ! The problem with this brand is that the grind is so uneven and chunky and also makes my baked goods really dense . Not only is Trader Joe 's a fraction of the price of this brand , the grind is very fine and consistent . Cost of TJ 's is $ 4.00 for 16oz . Also , I like the richness and extra fiber of the skins left on .	-1
BRM 'gluten free ' items still contain some sort of gluten cross contamination . We started SCD/GAPS to deal with lingering health problems caused by eating a regular GF diet for our Celiacs . I bought 2 different brands of almond flour , one made specifically for and by SCD and BRM . We used up the other brand and started using the BRM and guess what ? ALL symptoms of Celiac started coming back ! ! Doing an Internet search I did find out that many Celiac 's not only react badly to BRM almond flour , but to many other of BRM GF items too . Before SCD , we had stopped using any BRM GF baking products because we always got 'gluten sick ' from them . We will NEVER use another GF flour from BRM again because their food safety is just not strict enough . I did get a prompt refund from BRM for the $ 125 I spent on the 25lb box of almond flour though .	-1
Tasted bland . I bought it for my husband who usually likes butters . He did n't seem to enjoy them ... .did n't ask for more ... ...	-1
This bar has 265 calories and 135 from fat . I know , I know , its organic ! ! Sorry just because its organic and natural does n't mean that it can be 50 % fat and be good for you . If you like the taste fine , but be honest you 're eating it for the taste , about the same calories and fat content as a Dove candy bar .	-1
the review is about the 'heavenly hazelnut chocolate ' bar . ingredients are always listed by how much is in there , so check this : '' Cashews , organic agave nectar , organic sunflower seed kernels , dates , cocoa processed with alkali , hazelnuts , almonds , sprouted flax seed . `` now you see how much hazelnut is really in there : very little ! ! ! ! !	-1
I was impressed with the list of all organic raw ingredients of these bars , but the taste is bad . I wo n't buy it again .	-1
I did not think coconut and dark chocolate could ever taste bad.I was expecting mainly those 2 ingredients . I was wrong . It 's mostly a date flavor and texture with a sprinkle of coconut and a thin chocolate coating . I did not taste cashews or almonds at all . Maybe the folks that are rating these bars highly have acquired a taste for such items .	-1
This bar was a let down in comparison to the Chocolate Raspberry version . I would not buy again . Densly packed with calories ( 300 ) , 18g fat ( 6g saturated ) , 28g carbs ( 18g sugar ) , and bland . I would rather spend my calories elsewhere . It has a weird aftertaste , too .	-1
This stuff was stale . And the packages was full of crumbs . Buy the one at trader joes instead . Bigger bag and better tasting .	-1
Taste is all about personal opinion . My opinion is NO BUENO , the taste was not really as fruity as you would think . It just tasted very blah to me and even my 8 year daughter !	-1
I found it to be a little too pricey for the size . If it was double in size , then it would have been worth the money .	-1
Well was looking for something different in a hot cereal i like oatmeal but i do tire of it . This stuff just does not taste that great to me will not buy again !	-1
This stuff is absolutely disgusting ! ! ! It cooks to a mushy texture and is kinda like cement , with a slightly better flavor . I does not have any resistance like oats or other grains . It says creamy buckwheat cereal ... .description sound really good ! ! Do not buy it unless you like mush !	-1
The product has nice packaging , and is fresh but it has far too much added sugar & alas no blueberries , nor blueberry tastewhatsoever ! I added hot water & milk then it turned to mush no texture at that point , just sweet & mushyIt is crunchy from the dried cane syrup that surrounds each morsel . The small bits of apple were nice , butin the future will be sure to pick a non-sweetened one & one with some actual blueberries .	-1
No blueberry taste at all - In fact , not much taste . I tried feeding it to the birds , but they were n't interested either .	-1
If you are a fan of dark chocolate you might like this very much . Mom and I , on the other hand , do not like dark chocolate . We wo n't be purchasing this again . Luckily we purchased it in a local grocery store before buying this online as it 's awful.The texture is nice , had we let it cool down completely before having a piece it would have been less moist which may have helped some on the texture but as it was it was fine . There were no & # 34 ; off tastes & # 34 ; that I noticed mainly ( I think ) because the dark chocolate taste was overpowering to the point of it being BAD . Just plain gross . I almost finished a 2x2 inch piece but could n't make myself and as we all know you should always be able to totally enjoy eating brownies . This was certainly not the case with us . I have never had a brownie taste so nasty . I 'm sorry that I ca n't agree with most everyone else but wow , it was not good .	-1
I have a gluten reaction to these . Having looked on the celiac boards , I can tell you I 'm not alone . In defense of Bob 's Red Mill , I think that there are people with celiac disease that react to less than 20 ppm , so something could be gluten-free by the proposed FDA rule , and still make some canary-in-the-coal-mine-types sick.In fact , I would like to make it clear that I think Bob 's Red Mill is a good company , and they are telling the truth -- on the days they test their GF mixes , they come out at 20 ppm or less . However , that is still enough to make a lot of celiacs sick.So , if your celiac child or children are still sick , you should suspect this as a source of illness . Lots of supposedly gluten-free stuff is not , in fact , completely gluten-free , and parents just assume kids are cheating.However , I would n't write off Bob 's Red Mill yet -- many gluten free companies have to outsource their cocoa powder , which may not be gluten free , if the supplier is n't completely honest . Bob 's Red Mill could be following gluten free protocols , while their cocoa supplier might not be.I do tend to think it 's the cocoa manufacturer at fault : lots of people have no reaction at all to other products from Bob 's Red Mill .	-1
Not only did this product test 'positive ' using an Elisa EZ Gluten Test Strip -- -but my entire family got sick eating them ! ! ! They DO contain a trace amount of gluten -- -which is detrimental to the health of someone suffering from Celiac Disease .	-1
I am from Ukraine , so I grew up on buckwheat , and I know how `` Kasha '' is supposed to taste and look like . This is not it . Once you cook it , this Kasha looks like goo , not like Russian Kasha is supposed to be - very flaky , with each piece of wheat separated . It tastes pretty bad too , like it got burnt or something . No matter how much butter or salt you put in , it still tastes bad . The only reason I bought this product because it was organic and I did not want to buy it on Russian website ( was afraid of them stealing my credit card ) , but now I have to , because THIS is not good .	-1
I usually love all things cashew and agave , but this bar was a let down . I bought it because all the peanut butter bars are no where to be found due to contamination scares . The one good thing about the bar is that it 's not very sweet . Otherwise , I would n't get these again . Of the ingredients : Cashew , Date , Agave Nectar , Almond , Amaranth , Sprouted Flax . ( Certified Organic , I was only able to taste the flax and amaranth . It did n't have almond flavor or cashew flavor.Raw is supposed to be better , and most of the raw things I 've tried have tasted fantastic . This was n't the case with this bar .	-1
The concept of these bars seemed pretty cool - 95 % organic , live food , etc . The fat in them is `` good fat '' so that 's really not anything to worry about.The with the flavor I tried ( Cashew and Agave Nectar ) tasted HORRIBLE though . To get an idea , imagine an old smelly shoe , rotted meat , and seaweed all mixed together and coated in grease . That 's what these tasted like.Amazon sometimes posts reviews of `` similar items '' , so you might see this on a review for another flavor , whhich this does n't apply to . This revieww is only for the cashew/agave nectar .	-1
None of the five folks in my household would eat this . It tastes very raw grainy . We 're a granola type household that likes healthy organic foods , but this definitely did n't meet our standards for taste .	-1
I really wanted to like these because I love edamame and I 'm always looking for healthy snacks I can keep tucked away in my office ( for afternoon 'munchy ' emergencies ) ! I bought this along with the 'Roasted Veggies ' mix of which I will review separately because I had a much better experience with those.The flavor itself is n't bad but the freeze drying technique just does n't translate well for these soybeans . It was like popping a handfull of sponges and dry chalk into my mouth . Chewing on a bunch of these will instantly dry out your mouth and the resulting texture/mouthfeel is uncomfortable and well ... unpleasant.As another reviewer suggested , these might work well as a salad topping to add extra crunchiness assuming you like crunchy salads . I might consider using them as a garnish on top of a nice hot bowl of tomato soup . I would not repurchase this item or recommend this to anyone else .	-1
It may be a great buy for people who do n't make cheese and have no food allergies.Unfortunately , it was a waste of money . I relied on a positive reveiw , hoping to make cheese with this milk . It does not act or taste like pure powdered milk should.It does not make a curd at all.Additonally , the powder has some inclusions in it , small purple seeds ( grains ) , when dissolved in water- it becomes soapy , and tastes soapy too.. Probably mixed with one of those `` gums '' or `` beans '' to give a no-fat product a more `` creamy '' ( comes out as soapy ) flavor.I give it one star , because the producer of this milk does not indicate the full ingredient list of his milk and tricks customers like me into buying it relatively cheaply , but with a no-return `` catch '' .	-1
It 's almost impossible to get the lumps out of this short of using a stick blender . Also , the bags that the milk comes in are very weak . I dropped one from my counter top and milk power went everywhere .	-1
we are now disillusioned by bob 's red mill products , based on quality , taste and price.the milk is close to double what we get carnation on sale for ( .21/oz ) vs .35 ... and bob 's does not mix very well , not as well for us , not as easily as carnation.actually we have in the last few months just stopped buying bob 's red mill products and have gone for the less expensive items and have found that they , the less expernsive taste as good , have as good quality and are far cheaper . they are like newman 's own ; you overpay for image and hype . a taste test for example was done on newmans oreo style vs oreo cookies and the newman came in last . so again , hype and image..	-1
Where does this milk powder come from ? Bob 's Red Mill grinds flour in the Northwest but many of their products are `` packaged '' at their location but are not made there.This buttermilk powder did nothing for me . It did n't make a better biscuit or waffle and it made my loaf bread less tasty than if I had used regular milk powder . This was n't a successful product for me and I still have not finished the first package . I wo n't restock it when/if I run out of it .	-1
The last box of these bars tasted `` off '' I was n't sure why at first , but about half of the bars in the box were not sealed in their wrappers . They may have simply been rancid .	-1
[ edit to previous review below ] Imagine my surprise when my bars arrived today . Same Shop and Save order , same order history , smaller bars and NO notification to indicate the size of the bar had changed . It is essentially NOT the same product . Shame because the taste is still good but terrible service on the part of the manufacturer not to notify buyers of the change to the product . It dropped from 2.2 oz to 1.8 oz and is now more of a snack than lunch . *Original Review : Love these bars - satisfies my chocolate craving in a good and healthy way . Like these better than Larabar - no aftertaste and better price .	-1
Taste was alright , nothing special . Package oddly enough had an oily residue on the outside of the individual packages , inside a sealed box though . No damage to the actual product , but makes one question the quality control .	-1
Here is how I describe this bar : Take some great organic raspberries , some cane sugar sweetened chocolate and mix with your best garden dirt . Add enough water to get a nice dough consistency and roll into a log shape . Coat with some nice plastic varnish looking stuff and there you have it . One of the worst tastes I 've ever tasted . What is so disturbing is you can taste the great chocolate , and sweet raspberries but it 's overwhelmed by this oily/dirty taste . Frankly , it was so disgusting I had to spit it out.Others have tried them and liked them . Not fantastic , but not as vile a reaction as I had.So just buy one at your local store and try it before you commit to a box or subscription.Not for me . Ever .	-1
I should tell you that I wear dentures . The gooey texture of this product made it difficult for me to chew . I could not distinquish a flavor , good or bad , just bland . I would not purchase this again.Still searching for gluten free products that are more like popular granola bars .	-1
I 'm a connaisseur of power bars . I 've had Cliff , Lara , Luna , Pure , Renew Life , Smart Monkey , ThinkOrganic , and a host of others . This is the WORST power bar I 've ever tasted . It was coated with a layer of oil . It tasted so terrible , I took one bite and threw the rest away . I smelled it first though to make sure it was n't rancid . It wasn't.It 's hard to describe the taste . If anyone has tasted the `` Space Food Sticks '' that were around in the 1970s , then you know exactly what this bar tastes like.This bar is a complete waste of money and calories .	-1
I 'm all for a raw food diet , but these bars are just too darn oily and high in fat to be considered healthy . When you take the bar out of the wrapper , you 'll see what I mean . I 've literally had a few of these bars DRIPPING with oil . I figured maybe the oil separated from the nuts in the bar , like how Almond Butter does , but the bar was still extremely moist and oily , even with the oil separated.They taste `` OK '' ... this particular flavor is the best one they offer . A few of the flavors taste horrendous , but this Spirulina one is tolerable.I 've eaten these bars and have felt sluggish for hours afterwards . Too much oil . And I 'd love to see an independent test done on the label claims , because I think they 're higher in fat and calories than the label would lead you to believe.There are many other raw food bars that are better , on the market right now . The Organic Food Bar has a bunch .	-1
Got these for the usual healthy reasons , but it turned out to be a big mistake . Kinda tastes likes your eating a big clump of grassy dirt .	-1
It wasnt bad.. BUT it was TOOOO oily . It was like eating a greasy turd when it came to texture . The Go Raw brand has a better product its like eating healthy brittle with flax seed and spirulina in it plus its not as sweet.. BUT this was just way Too oily , if you are wanting to eat this on the go you better have somthing to clean your hands with when you are finished .	-1
I bought this along with two other flavors of this brand and I absolutely loved raspberry chocolate and also Hazelnut chocolate . They literally tasted like brownies with almonds in them . this one though didnt taste so great but i should have known better anyway . It is spirulina after all and if you dont already know if you like that taste or not than maybe you shouldnt buy a whole box of this flavor .	-1
Besides the color and texture which was so off-putting that I almost could n't make myself try it , they were edible..at first . Their nutritional value is n't that great : ~Way too high of fat ( 18g as it stated on BAR , 16g stated on website ) ~High Carbs ( 30 ) ~Too much sugar ( 10g ) ~Little vitamin value/low fiber~the only redeeming quality is 9g of protein.These bars are slimy and thick textured like pulverized grass mixed with oil . They are very oily . After the first one I could n't make myself eat another so that was it for me . I wo n't repurchase or buy any other flavor .	-1
I am a fan of Bob 's Red Mill 's products and have been eating the date PIECES for years and love them . I decided to give the `` Crumbles '' a try since I use dates in baking and thought the smaller bits would be good for that as well as in my cereal.I received the item and the freshness date is good until at least a year- excellent . I always check that first.The packaging was intact- also important.I opened a bag and put a handful of the Crumbles on my cereal . Instead of little bits of the usual date sweetness I 've had with the Pieces what I tasted was bitterness ! I thought maybe I just had eaten a `` bad '' few so I ate some directly from the bag and they had the same bitter and unpleasant taste . Very disappointing and unexpected .	-1
Very good idea , however , they have some kind of flour coating on them and are not sweet at all . It 's a shame because they would come in handy when I need them for a recipe and do n't have to chop up whole dates .	-1
Usually I agree with other 's reviews on products , but not these Date Crumbles . They are not good- I was expecting a sweet snack that as one reviewer wrote I could `` eat right out of the bag . '' Maybe if I was super hungry . They just did n't do it for me . Now I have 4 bags to figure out what to do with . Sorry Bob 's . Love all your other stuff !	-1
I bought this hoping it would be a good substitute for another famous brand of low-carb baking mix . Boy was I wrong . The serving size is very small so the carb count adds up quicker than you 'd think , and it just does n't taste very good . Not worth the carbs for me , for sure . Mine 's just sitting there . I keep thinking eventually I 'll find a use for it .	-1
Its a shame the FDA does not regulate these companies . These so called low carb breads , pastas and chocolate have been tested and found to have even more carbs and calories then there non low carbs counter parts . Its terrible that they get away with this.If you purchase . Beware that the only thing you will lose is money	-1
I use a lot of the Red Mill products , but this product is n't up to the usual Red Mill value.. I have now tried making two loafs . Neither one of them would rise.. I followed the directions to a T , so I have no idea what 's wrong with it.. It calls for heavy cream in the directions , which is n't cheap , so I have now wasted that money on top of the price of each package.. At over $ 5 a loaf for this mix , I feel very short changed.I 'd rate it a 0 if the Amazon program would let me ... I use a bread machine , which I use for other loafs of bread that come out beautifully . In fact , I just made a low carb loaf from scratch yesterday that came out perfect.. The loaf I tried from this mix the day before looked like a clump of meatloaf.. I tried another loaf today with this mix , only this time I added 2 tablespoons of raw sugar and an additional tsp of fast rising yeast , thinking perhaps the yeast was no good and/or the product needed some sugar to activate the yeast.. This loaf of bread also looks like a lump of meatloaf..I 'm disgusted with this product and will be writing Red Mill and Amazon to complain.. What a waste of time , money and energy ! ! From now on , I 'll just stick to my from scratch low carb bread mix..	-1
I was not thrilled with this product . The directions required rather expensive add-in ingredients and then blew up into an enormous loaf that expanded far beyond the capacity of my two-pound bread machine . About one-third of the loaf ended up raw in the middle , and the part that actually baked tasted so nasty ( bitter ! ) that I threw it out . Very disappointing .	-1
I love Bobs Red Mill , so I hate that I have to score this so low . I understood when I bought it that it would taste nothing like real bread ( we all know a bread made with not many carbs probably wo n't taste good ) . However , I thought I would at least be able to eat it ... ... ... ... ... ..this went straight in the trash . It is rubbery , has a strong flavor , and not something I would recommend to anyone . Sorry Bobs Red Mill - I still like your other products !	-1
Awful , NO flavors that I could ever enjoy , and the loaf was the ugliest stringently threaded dough I have ever seen . Even manually punching down the dough did not help .	-1
I purchased these because the website states that they are made from 100 % Bananas and Honey . Read the fine print and you will find that they also contain added sugar , banana flavoring and coconut oil . They do n't even taste like bananas ... .with all the added ingredients , what can you expect ?	-1
What a shame . I have used other products by this company , and normally have a positive association with them . However , due to serious chronic illness I am moving my diet from vegetarian to more specifically whole and unprocessed , so I am looking for anything that can help me enjoy that switch since I have quite the sodium addiction . Although I have been lacto-vegetarian ( and vegan at points ) for most of my life , I never knew about nutritional yeast until just recently . I put this item in my cart as the highest rated among the options , and was excited to buy it at my next check-out.But then I was watching a video about cancer-causing additives in food , and remembered that as the food industry moves away from using the term MSG , they have replaced it with various terms , including those with the word yeast . I thought I 'd better do some research to be sure my beloved new nutritional yeast package was unrelated to that . Bummer . It turns out that nutritional yeast , even when grown in a seemingly healthy and vegan way , is related to free glutamic acid , which is common to food additives including MSG , aspartame , etc . and has been clearly linked in non-industry-sponsored ( read unbiased ) studies to causing neuro-endocrine diseases like mine , and rapidly increasing the growth of cancerous tumors in those who already have cancer presence . Although I do not have a clear MSG allergy like some of my relatives , my research indicated that most people need severe damage to their brains before they notice an effect - which may take many years to accumulate . Many seemingly very healthy foods marketed to the vegan community do contain these additives , and that may be done with no ill intent whatsoever or knowledge on the part of the company that it can be harmful.I 'm not going to say that all people who are ingesting this are at serious health risk , because I do not know . But certainly a large segment of us turn to such options to improve our health , not just because we love the socially isolating aspects of turning down the food everyone else around us is enjoying . I was using a cheesy additive to my air-popped popcorn and decided to find an alternative because that contained MSG and multiple chemicals in it . It does n't make much sense to pay even more to put the exact same thing with a different name on it on my food . I guess natural food tastes like it tastes , and any flavor enhancer you add may taste great but is still altering what you are taking into your body . For those who have strong chemical sensitivities and concerns about the food they are ingesting , and in particular those who have an identified allergy to MSG ( or addiction to it ) , be cautious about your use of nutritional yeast . It has a more healthy-sounding name , but may be just as dangerous to your health as other additives that are more clearly labeled.I am aware that we are all exposed to chemicals every day from a variety of places and some will choose to eat this anyway , and certainly it does have some vitamins that can be positive ( so does candy with vitamins added to it ) - but I am doing my best to limit my exposure to toxins , since I am a young person who is already very ill . I was concerned that after reading countless reviews on Amazon for nutritional yeast , not one of them mentioned that it might be unsafe and have links to serious health problems , particularly for those with cancer , autoimmune diseases , intestinal disease , or endocrine dysfunction . So now at least my review can be added to the many positive ones for your consideration . I am sure I would be one of those who would eat it in high quantities and find it addictive , and so for me getting high exposure to this ingredient even though it is not alive and not the same thing as MSG is still too risky to be worth starting. -- -- -Edit : Since posting this review , I asked my doctor . Here is the result : The point is not whether it is naturally occurring , or whether it contains other nutrients . The point is that glutamic acid , in any form , in any excess amount , is a neuro-excitotoxin . For those of us with chronic illness that affects the brain , GI tract , and/or endocrine system , or those with cancer , glutamic acid in any form needs to be limited . My doctor , who is one of the top research doctors in the country , confirmed this - I need to limit my levels , no matter where they come from , or if they are naturally occurring or not , and this includes nutritional yeast . The concern for me was reading how many reviewers spoon this stuff on liberally every day with no limit and mention its `` addictive '' qualities . They need to know , since they my not have one of the top immunologists as I do , that people with chronic illness or cancer need to limit glutamic acid intake as much as they can - it feeds cancer tumors directly , and it significantly increases dysfunction in diseases such as ME/CFS or MS . It also can cause diabetes.From a paper my doctor gave me : '' Without glutamate we 'd be unable to respond quickly to events but too much glutamate can lead to a condition called excitotoxicity which can damage or destroy neurons . Recent research has identified excess glutamate as a potential mechanism leading to the onset of type II diabetes via the destruction of pancreatic cells by glutamate ( Eliana et al , 2011 ) . ... In fact , research is increasingly suggesting that oxidative stress , mitochondrial dysfunction and glutamate excitotoxicity are intrinsically linked in a range of neuroinflammatory conditions ( Coyle and Puttfarcken , 1993 ) presenting as various symptom complexes '' This does not apply to all , but it does affect those with serious illness , and everyone needs to be aware that you can not just have unlimited amounts with no effect .	-1
This is a very small bag to start . The taste is ok but the texture is just odd . It is freeze dried which makes them almost hard . Some are crunchy and melt in your mouth and some are so hard you have to pick them out of your teeth . Not worth it to me .	-1
I first want to affirm that I tried other flavors and they were fine - peas and strawberry is fine . Mango is odd tasting . I know there are no additives - just freeze dried fruit or veggie - but Mango tastes as if it has something & # 34 ; chemical & # 34 ; added to it . I am a long time fan of dried mango and fresh mango - but this stuff does n't even taste like Mango . I understand freeze dried mango is going to have completely different texture than fresh/dried mango , but this product does n't taste like real mango . It is super sweet - almost too sweet for my palate , but I account that to natural fruit sugar being concentrated - so I set that issue aside . What turned off my taste buds waas the & # 34 ; chemical & # 34 ; and & # 34 ; funny odd & # 34 ; after taste.I really do appreciate this company is GMO free , no sugar , no additives or artificial chemicals . Certainly a healthier choice to eat this than potato chips or corn chips full of hydrogenated trans fats . Some of the other flavors I tried were a lot better - I like the pea flavor - especially the & # 34 ; crunch factor. & # 34 ; I visited the website and the manufacturer is coming out with ORGANIC flavors soon - I think it is an & # 34 ; in progress & # 34 ; new product - soon they will have ORGANIC pea and strawberry . I do n't think most people know that conventionally grown , non-organic strawberries are always sprayed with highly toxic Methyl Bromide pesticide . Methyl Bromide pesticide is banned in about 30 nations around the world . This makes it good news that this manufacturer will soon beoffering Organic Strawberry Crunchies option ! The price seems high - $ 5.00 for just 1.5 ounces - but considering it is a dehydrated product - 1.5 ounces of Crunchies is probably 8 or 10 ounces when it is fresh produce - before the freeze drying process . The package states 8 to 10 ounces of fresh produce is required to make just one pound of freeze dried Crunchies . It 's a good idea to keep a packet or two in your purse or tote bag for a healthy snack when you are on the go and do n't want to succumb to eating candy or potato chips .	-1
To start , the plastic box this is in was cracked when I opened the box - so I could n't give this as the gift I had intended it to be , which was a blessing actually . I kept it , thinking I had myself a yummy box of candy all to myself . Well ... The chocolate is really waxy , and the toffee pennies have a strange , chemical taste.The chocolate/orange thing is just gross & the whole thing left a lot to be desired . I ended up pitching it out .	-1
I 've deducted four stars since my original review.While 95 % of the FLAVOUR is gone in two minutes , your $ 50 is gone immediately .	-1
I paid for cross-pack sardines ( got three cans out of a 12pk ) got two layer brisling in a cross-pack box . Cross-pack costs more . ( I 've noticed that American companies are increasing their bottom line by a lot of creative means -- less and less in container at same or higher price , etc . ) Yes , I know the difference . Besides , I 'm getting Crown Prince Natural two layer brisling sardines in EVOO via S & S . Not nice to fool a little old retired woman ! Therefore , a one star for what I did n't get .	-1
WHY ? ? ? RUIN A PERFECTLY GOOD FOOD with `` HIGH SODIUM/SALT '' CONTENT = POISON TO YOUR BODY & VERY DANGEROUS TO YOU HEALTH ; If You want to Ruin Your Health , Eat HIGH SALT/SODIUM Food Products ; SALT is A PRESERVATIVE/DEssicant ; EXcessive Amounts , Cause `` FLUID RETENTION '' & Numerous AGE RElated Alements when USED FOR EXTENDED PERIOD TIME . RESEARCH IT FOR YOURSELF IF YOU DONT BELIEVE ME ! !	-1
These little guys are OKAY at best.They 're not awful , but they were n't really what I was looking for . Certainly NOT the kind of sardines I 'd devour in one sitting ... in fact , I had to force myself to come back to the can and finish it so it would n't go to waste.As soon as they came , I opened 1 can and ate it . The first thought I had about it was , `` where 's the flavor ? '' and then as I ate more and more of it , buyer 's remorse crept in as I knew I could n't return these and I was stuck with 23 more cans of it.So , I was pretty disappointed with the flavor , or lack thereof and will probably stick to getting the King Oscar kind .	-1
Yuck ! The little fish taste like vinegar . I like a mustard taste but the vinegar overpowers the mustard . I was sent twelve boxes . I rinsed them off with hot water to try to get rid of the sauce but the vinegar still hung on . I choked them down , at least eight boxes over a period of time but the last four I fed to the dogs . ( they liked them ! ) .	-1
I did n't buy these again , and had to try real hard to use the 12 cans . I could n't make a good sauce out of it . It 's a waste of time trying to find a good recipe when the base of the sauce is tasteless	-1
Of the 12 cans in the box , all but 2 were badly dented and/or swollen . When opened , gasses swooshed out , indicating a highly dangerous bacterial toxin . If I 'd eaten any , even a drop , lethal food poisoning would have occurred . The University Medical Center Poison Control expert told me ( when I called to ask if they were safe to eat ) that botulism is the most dangerous toxin occurring naturally on earth . It is a deadly neurotoxin , causing possibly painful seizures , and then breathing stops as nerves die . The seller must have thought they 'd save a buck by shipping a box of defective cans to an unsuspecting customer , and did n't care that whoever ate it would probably die ! ( I hope it was n't intentionally malicious ! ) There is no more unethical , perhaps criminal conduct . Would it be manslaughter or murder , had I not known how dangerous it is to eat from dented or swollen cans ? Even a very small amount , about a drop , can kill , the Poison Control Center said . Amazon.com should protect future buyers and remove this company from their website . How many young people would not know a deadly neurotoxin may be present ? When you see a meat can spew out gas , a byproduct the bacteria produces that stays in the can is botulism neurotoxin . I was tempted to add it to my soup , but vaguely remembered a high school Home Economics teacher taught us not to use open or dented cans . They shipped me four or more swollen cans . The other six cans were not just slightly dented , but crushed on top with deep , sharp indentations , as though hit by a blunt instrument . So someone put 10 out of 12 highly dangerous cans of clams into one box and shipped them to me . I 'm so lucky I thought to call Poison Control , or I 'd be dead right now . Would you trust such a seller who 'd do this , if you had n't caught them ? I 'm writing this to warn others because the next unsuspecting buyer may not recognize the grave danger .	-1
These clams from China are very sandy and I do n't care for the taste either . Do n't get me wrong -- I like clams and I have had excellent canned smoked clams from another brand in the past . Honestly , I was expecting more flavor and less sand . I could go on but why ?	-1
I did n't really like the taste of the clams , and the consistency . I wish I could have tasted it with just one jar before I ordered a pack , I kinda read the reviews and thought I would like it , but I did n't . And now I am stuck with 10 cans ( I managed to eat 2 with pasta , where its taste is barely noticeable ) . I guess , I will just add it to salads and pasta as a source of protein , but make sure i ca n't taste it . Not liked . : (	-1
I was not highly impressed with these sardines . Not a great taste , higher in fat and lower in protein than the ones packed in olive oil , BUT they are lower in sodium than most . Amazon is still the best place to buy them , but just make sure what you really want first . The two layer in olive oil have a much better flavor and texture and they are not that much more in price .	-1
I like these sardines and it seemed like a good deal so I ordered the box . Arrived a while ago . Two of the tins had broken open and everything is soaked in olive oil . I expect some kind of satisfaction from Amazon , have already sent an email inquiry . If they make good on it , I will edit the review to reflect the fact.I was promptly contacted by amazon by e-mail and offered a refund which I accepted .	-1
OVERALL , I RATE THE `` SARDINES '' AS EXCELLENT , BUT TOO MUCH SODIUM CONTENT ( 420MG SALT RUINS SARDINES ) , ITS `` OVERKILL '' SALT/SODIUM IS A PRESERVATIVE ; ITS EFFECT ON THE HUMAN BODY IS WELL DOCUMENTED & ITS `` NOT GOOD '' ; THIS PRODUCT HAS `` KILLER '' AMOUNT OF SALT/SODIUM ; ITS `` OK '' FOR OCCASIONAL CONSUMPTION , BUT ! ! ! ! ! ! ; IF YOU HAVE HIGH SALT INTAKE THIS MIGHT SEND YOU `` OVER THE CLIFF '' OF NO RETURN ; HIGH BLOOD PRESSURE & `` MANY '' other PHYSICAL ALIMENTS , ESPECIALLY AS YOU GET `` OLDER '' YOU BECOME `` MORE SUSEPTIABLE '' TO NEGATIVE EFFECTS OF `` TOO MUCH SALT/SODIUM '' IN YOUR DIET : SALT IS A `` PRESERVATIVE '' & EXCESSIVE AMOUNTS `` DRY '' LIKE DESSICANT `` REMOVES MOISTURE '' FROM YOUR BODY & MAKES YOU LOOK LIKE A LIVING `` MUMMY '' OVER TIME `` DRY & LEATHERY '' ; ALSO CAUSES `` FLUID RETENTION '' AKA : `` SWELLING '' OF YOU BODY ( EXTREMITIES , FINGERS , LEGS , ETC > ) : BEWARE EXCESSIVE AMOUNTS OF SALT/SODIUM IN YOU DIET ! ! ! ! ! ! ; WHAT I SAID SEEMS `` CONTRADICTORY '' , BUT EXCESS SODIUM DOES HAVE THESE TWO PRONOUNCED EFFECTS , FIRST ONE , THEN THE OTHER , DEPENDING ON A `` LOT OF VARIABLES '' ..	-1
The MOST moist , delicious , & sustainably caught sardines are , by and far , the Wild Planet Brand ! I tried both the `` Season '' and `` Crown Prince '' brands and the difference in flavor and quality was light years away from the Wild Planet brand.I live in New England and can only find WILD PLANET brand in my local Stop and Shop.It 's amazing that we have 3 `` Whole Foods '' Markets in my state and not one carries the Wild Planet brand ! They are only carry what I believe to be the inferior quality brands that I mentioned.I 'm sure that the Hoffman and Manischewitz families that own Crown Prince and Season brands would n't mind having the Wild Planet brand alongside their own , since they feel theirs are such great quality , right ? Who knows , they just might learn something about having high standards from the lovely bunch of people that own Wild Planet in California.To top it off , all Wild Planet products are in BPA free cans ... what more can you ask for ?	-1
I tried this skinless/boneless sardines in water brand and am very disappointed . Nothing to compare with Reese . Part of the sardines meat is dark brown and disgusting ... .I had to remove this part so I lost 1/5 of the sardine ... .When you can eat the whole sardine from the Reese brand and will not find any debris or suspicious meat ... So I will definitively go back to the Reese brand even though it 's more expensive .	-1
My wife and I are used to buying canned Alaskan salmon from Costco . Since we do n't have a Costco close to home , I decided to search Amazon for a suitable alternative . Given the generally positive reviews on this brand , I never thought I could be so disappointed . It only took opening 2 cans to realize that this stuff is NASTY -- nothing like the high-quality canned Alaskan salmon from Costco . Rather , I think they simply chop up the whole fish and cook the chunks in the cans -- skin , bones , and all . Yes , it 's gross , to say the least . I thought for sure that I had been duped by a product description that does not match the actual product . However , when I went back to Amazon to check , I found that , indeed , skins and bones are mentioned in the listing . These sickly inclusions are described as BENEFITS because they enhance the calcium and Omega 3 content of the salmon . Sure , and I 'll bet there are benefits to eating dirt , too ( lots of natural minerals the body needs ! ) , but I do n't eat dirt . Further , I 'd like to know if a doctor would recommend human beings eating needle-thin salmon rib bones . You not only get the salmon ribs , you get the entire spine , which is not my idea of adding a little crunch to a sandwich . I 'd rather go for celery or chips than chomping down on a salmon spine . I am aghast that this salmon is actually rated 4 stars on Amazon . Honestly , I do n't know if I would feed this to my cat ( if I had one ) . So , at this point , I am only hoping that I can block out the images I saw when I opened the 2 cans of this salmon we tried before deciding to return the rest . If I can not , then I will never eat salmon for the rest of my life . Am I exaggerating a bit ? No .	-1
I was looking for a mostly savory with very light sweet undertones . This was bland with slight bitter undertones . Smelled fishy but I can usually get past that if it tastes good . It really did n't . I was disappointing because I read the ratings and though tit might be good . Perhaps I am just not a big fan of & # 34 ; Alderwood & # 34 ; . Pass on this for the good stuff at a grocery store .	-1
there is NO pink in this salmon..it is cooked so much it is white ... think a can of tune ... but at the higher price you pay here for salmon ... very hard to tell just what fish this is ... you have to take it on faith i guess it is what they say it is ... ..ultra strong fish smell , not like fresh fish smells ... friends across the hall will know you are having some old fish for dinner ... .the taste is a gag-fest-palooza ... ... ... the amount in the can is TINY , the weight is in the liquidthe salmon is sure not firm , it is mushy ... add the skin and bones for more mush and more gag ... this is a never buy again item ... .	-1
390mg SODIUM/SALT PER 3.25oz TIN/CAN `` STILL TO HIGH '' Based on some of the canned fish products Ive reviewed ; Herring is `` ABOVE AVERAGE '' Fish Product , so I give it 2 STARS BECAUSE OF THE `` HIGHER SODIUM/SALT '' WHICH `` RUINS/DEGRADES '' THE `` A '' `` ABOVE AVERAGE/QUALITY '' FISH ( HERRING ) .	-1
Maybe it 's just that I almost always buy skinless and boneless sardines packed in extra virgin olive oil but I found these sardines packed in water to be really mushy and fishy tasting . I love sardines but was very disappointed by the flavor and consistency of these sardines . And they are not cheap either so I 'll try to use them by adding mayonaise ( lots of mayonaise ) in a sandwich to help disquise the truly unpleasant taste . I will NOT be buying these packed in water ever again ! I do n't know if those packed in water but manufactured by other companies are of the same quality . They were truly ... ... 'ughhhh ' . Maybe you are use to this taste and mushy texture ... so please continue eating this really healthy food . Sardines are the lowest member of the mercury absorption chain so are better for you than the contaminated tuna these days . I just ca n't even think of eating these particular canned sardines straight from the can for a snack ever again ... ..just thinking about doing this makes me feel sick !	-1
WHAT ? ? ? IS THE SODIUM/SALT CONTENT ; EVERY ANCHOVIE PRODUCT I EVER CAME ACROSS HAS : `` KILLER/DEADLY '' AMOUNTS OF `` SALT/SODIUM '' , SO MUCH SO , THAT THEY ARE RENDERED `` UNEATABLE/NON FOOD/DEADLY '' ; EXCESSIVE SALT/SODIUM INTAKE IS KNOWN TO CAUSE `` ALL KINDS '' OF PHYSICAL ALIMENTS '' , ESPECIALLY WHEN INGESTED OVER LONGER PERIODS OF TIME >	-1
I should have sent this back as soon as it arrived . It had a couple leaking jars and it 's impossible to tell which ones are leaking . They all taste so bad and are so disgusting it 's impossible to tell if any of the jars are sealed . This is like salted road kill ! I threw it all away ! This is another amazon product with fake reviews . No one could possibly like this product ! Make sure your reviews are posted ! Amazon has a habit of not posting negative reviews !	-1
Great Tuna but ... price up in last 6 months ... 50 % on the 12 oz cans and % 100 on the 6 oz cans .. case of 12 ... sorry ... been ordering this for some time .. .but no more	-1
This is a great product that I buy every week at Trader Joe 's , where it costs two-twenty-nine a tin . If you were to buy twenty-four of them it 'd be fifty-four ninety-six . This guy here wants over a hundred , which is practically double TG 's price , so he gets one star from me for being such a smartas . Never buy online assuming you get a good price w/o comparing prices beforehand . Once more : I heartily recommend this product , but watch the prices . There 's a nine-pack offering ( also on this site ) that , while still overpriced compared to TJ 's , is priced much more reasonably than this thing here ( you 'd think the more you buy the better the price , but it 's exactly the opposite with this product ) .07/31/2013 : Last year this stuff disappeared without trace from everywhere for some reason . Well , there 's good news : it 's back -- I just got a stack of them at Trader Joe 's for two sixty-nine a can . A bit more expensive than the initial two twenty-nine , but not out of reach for such a nice product .	-1
No flavor at all , so disappointed . Bought this based on the reviews and what a waste of money . Packed in water and taste like water . Say your money .	-1
I just got my order today and had to try it out.While I 'll disagree with others that have gotten 'mush ' outta the can , my initial can was above that.Not what I would call chunks by any stretch , but not mush.As for taste ? Pretty much none . If it were n't for the additives , it would n't have any taste at all.I 've never had Blue crab . But if this is the 'comparison ' , I 'll not try it either.Keep in mind that I can get Dungeness year round , as well as Red Rock crab.I 'll likely add it to the cats food . Maybe she can get some flavor out of it ?	-1
Thoroughly disgusting . I do n't like sweet meat , but with sweet and sour , it 's usually okay . This was like pouring syrup of ipecac over chicken , and the rice was pasty and nasty . Two bites- straight to the trash . Glad I did n't buy 12 boxes of this crap . Nasty .	-1
I 'm not an Asian food expert but it does n't appear Betty Crocker is either . My goodness , I bought a whole case of these seeing as I love Lo Mein . Well , search further if you are looking for the real thing . Here it appears like broken spaghetti , and the flavor packet obviously has a lot of bouillon in it , so you get broken spaghetti with salty chicken imitation flavoring . How healthy , but then if you do n't know what good Lo Mein is , and if you like spaghetti , you may be happy with it . It is n't awful tasting but not that good tasting and definitely not the same texture as Lo Mein . The box makes the noodles look bigger and they are actually somewhere between angel hair and regular spaghetti size . It 's just not what it says , and it is not good for you . And , a lot of Asian food is rice noodles or something much more healthy . Once this is cooked up it does finally make more than what it initially looks like ( very little ) , but really not all that much . Betty needs to remember that Asian meals are served with big helpings and this was probably a little less than the size of one real Asian dinner helping . I was disappointed all around on this product . Here 's something odd , the picture of the product that goes with this review is in a totally different box than what I got . The boxes I got are red and do n't disclose it 's Betty Crocker except a small spoon on one side . It 's almost an attempt to leave the name off . Not the norm for this on , company . Ca n't say I blame her for not advertising her name well on this one .	-1
This purchase was not as I had expected . The Old El Paso Mexican Rice had somewhat of a bitter taste like too much chili powder . Also did not have as much sauce as I would have liked , was kind of dry .	-1
What a waste ... .we did not care for these , but , the tostadoes were excellent ... but that is all I can say .	-1
Minimal mint taste . List of ingredients : Wheat flour , Vegetable margarine ( palm oil , palm kernal oil , canola oil , water , salt , vegetable monoglycerides , citrus acid , flavor ) sugar , invert sugar syrup , cocoa powder , sweet chocolate chips 1 % , leavening , natural peppermint flavor . I will just stay with Trader Joe 's thins .	-1
My mother is Korean , so I was born and raised there . We ate tons of delicious rice ! ! The Asians truly know what tastes good in terms of rice ! ! We usually eat Kokuho rose or Nishiki , but I wanted to find an organic rice so I bought this from the HFS . I do n't know if it is different from what others have eaten here , but as soon as I opened the jar , it smelled rancid ! But , the expiration date was 2016 , so I thought I would try cooking it.The taste was really nasty and so was the texture ! It was more like parboiled rice . No stickiness to it at all ! I do n't know how anyone could make sushi out of this . Also , I have never had this problem before with other rices , but after eating this , my blood sugar crashed both times that I ate it . And I felt really tired . I wonder if this was really a bad , rancid batch and was mislabeled in terms of the expiration date ? Anyway ... .I will never buy this again , as it was really expensive for the quantity , with it not even being organic ! I will go back to my Asian rice ( which is really cheap , BTW ) until I can find a good organic Asian variety of rice .	-1
Consumer Reports November 2012 issue found that most rice harvested in Texas . Per the consumer report , this brand of rice was found to contain 4.2 to 7.6 micrograms of arsenic per 1/4 cup uncooked serving . It is recommended that you consume no more than 1-2 servings of this rice per week.View the [ ... ] for more information about issues with arsenic in rice from Texas.Bottom line : DONT BUY THIS RICE . Long grain brown rice from California , Thailand , and other areas typically do not contain arsenic .	-1
I have soy-corn-gluten allergies , and this product gives me a strong allergic reaction - I get edema ( swelling ) from it . For those with allergies - it is unsafe to use . For people who do n't have allergies - may be a good product .	-1
I 'm going to have to go against everyone else 's reviews here so far , because I found this rice to be both dry and very bland . It 's certainly not delicious , and I was extremely disappointed , particularly because I bought it on the strength of the other reviews here.For those curious , I made this in my Zojirushi ( made in Japan ) rice cooker , which makes perfect rice every time.On the plus side , it certainly is healthy , and other people seem to like it , but I did n't at all .	-1
Nothing of this rice resembles to any Basmati rice I have ever eaten . The color , the uncooked size , the cooked length , the smell , and the flavor were _all_ off.As you could say by now , it was a very disappointing experience and I 'd trade it with American long grain rice with no hesitation.It could be used in Sushi as it becomes too sticky and soft and if you have doubt , let me just say that I have eaten and cooked rice for a rather long time .	-1
I had high hopes for something with chocolate and caramel in the name , but these just did n't do it for me . The texture was weird , and hard to chew , and the flavors left a lot to be desired . I 'll stick with my Kashi Berry Lemonade Chewy Granola Bars instead .	-1
For name and appearance this bar should receive a five , but what really counts is taste , this I can only describe as barn flavors which gives it a minus 100 . As far as the chocolate and caramel flavors you could see them but the taste sure was not . I had other people try them , I could n't even give them away .	-1
I really like the Kashi cereals and thought I 'd try their snack bars . Not so good . Does n't have the magic the cereal does . Maybe its too sweet .	-1
This turkey jerky is really bad quality jerky . It comes as a bunch of tiny extremely thin pressed bits in tiny bags . The little pieces are dry , bad tasting and look like they are reconstituted without any texture to them at all . I have been getting jerky from a place called Mountain America Jerky which recently raised their prices and so I am trying Amazon.com merchants . This jerky is really really bad . The other Amazon.com merchant I have tried for turkey jerky is Golden Valley which is much much better than this jerky . Do n't get this stuff at all . It is really bad . Try the Golden Valley jerky also here at amazon . That at least has some decent flavor and you can tell it once was a turkey ! This stuff is just awful .	-1
I like the snackmaster turkey jerky but wanted to try another brand . What a waste of money and time . I really wanted to like this but it 's really hard to chew and has a strange after taste . Would strongly recommend the snackmaster brand over this one .	-1
I love the other Kashi oatmeals , golden maple being my favorite , but this Truly Vanilla one is truly disgusting . It 's a sloppy , sticky mess , and it tastes almost exactly like raw dough . It has a gross yeasty taste to it and it 's really sticky and unappetizing in your mouth . I have no idea where these good reviews came from . I took 2 bites and could n't eat anymore .	-1
Sooo bland . Was excited to try this but sadly was disappointed . Pretty much flavorless , nothing like a Turtle flavor , too hard to chew and too much sugar for such a tasteless chunk . Not impressed and definitely wo n't be repurchasing .	-1
I bought these on the basis of other reviews and I 'm so sorry . They 're dry and tasteless at best , weird chemical tasting at worst . I do n't recommend them and ca n't believe that some people think these taste good .	-1
If you have TMJ , steer far away from this . It 's inedible . Never mind the taste , which is completely bland and somewhat chalky , but this is very , VERY tough to chew for someone with TMJ issues . I made the mistake of looking at the picture and spotting `` nougat , '' which really should n't be *that* chewy . I mean , if I can handle a room-temperature Clif bar ... Maybe I 'll microwave the ones left in the box to make them edible .	-1
very disappointed in product , was looking for something for kids to eat for a do-it yourself quick snack ... they wo n't eat even with extra cheese added to the top ...	-1
Disgusting ! inedible ! Not only could I not indulge in this product , my greyhound who loves pasta and tomato sauce took one whiff and he walked away ! I should have known seeing my natural food store had pulled it off the shelves and had it on clearance for 50 cents lol	-1
I was excited when I found this product , thinking that I had found a great , easy meal for busy nights . When I opened it , I was very disappointed at the unpleasant smell and when I actually bit into the noodles , I was completely disgusted- the texture was extremely bad , and they tasted like they 'd been packaged and repackaged over and over again . Kids with undiscriminating tastes who just want something to look like what their friends are eating might find this ok- but it was absolutely inedible for me . I ate a few bites- forced my husband to try it , who also agreed that it was gross , and threw the rest down the garbage disposal . Good idea , bad execution . I have been gluten free most of my life and like many GF products and pastas , but this product really was unusually bad .	-1
We 're a gluten-free household and when I last went to Whole Foods , I bought this to try . It was a small size , had a reasonably modest caloric count , and I thought this could be a nice spaghetti snack-style treat when I was feeling lazy . I liked the ingredients list did n't have a ton of sugar and weird preservatives , although it does have modified starch and xanthum gum.But it comes down to this : it tastes not good . Pretty icky . The sauce is weirdly sweet and the noodles are short ( like spaghetti that 's cut into small pieces , like for a child ) and unappealing . The texture of the noodles is rather hideous : kinda grainy , like rice that was n't fully cooked . It 's like a mutant version of Franco American canned spaghetti ( remember that brand ? ) -- soupy and sweet , but this is the `` yucky '' mutant version . I totally do n't understand the high-star reviews.Honestly , I am willing to give up some on taste/texture for convenience , cause some days , you do n't feel well or are in a rush , but this is not worth the trade-off . I 'll take the time and make gluten-free pasta and eat leftovers before I eat this again . There are delicious gluten free pastas on the market and you can put any diet-friendly homemade or jarred sauce you like . I have no idea how Orgran could ruin such a simple food.Really disappointed . I so wanted this to be nice .	-1
This is very salty . I was hoping for better flavor . I will try it again and if I change my mind , I 'll change my review .	-1
This tastes like a cheap , junk food version of a thai curry.Maybe I 'm spoiled because the thai restaurants by me are really good , but this was not even close to a restaurant thai curry .	-1
Way too much coriander for my taste buds . Did n't like it . Gave to a friend who liked it okay . It is enough to last a long time .	-1
..others may like it . I found the coriander to be overwhelming . Gave the product to a friend and they seemed to like it . If you are a fan of coriander/cilantro then you may like it . It seems pricey but it also makes quite a lot and appears that it would last a long long time ( - :	-1
These cookies taste like those health fiber cookies and not really that good , they dont contain alot of nuts or flavor , I purchased this flavor and the banana nut flavor.. honestly they both taste identical . I canceiled my subscription for them . but my wife says `` when she needs fiber she will eat 1 '' ... I just replied `` LOL go for it '' .	-1
Do n't know what happened to Baker 's Breakfast Cookies ... used to buy them direct years ago and they were wonderful . I happily purchased the Fruit and Nut cookies ... like eating a mushy cardboard hockey puck ... will not be placing another order . Everything mushed together ; no identifiable fruit or nut ... just mush on the inside and dry outside ... with nothing to identify ingredients and the taste was bland ... sad because they used to LOOK and TASTE like cookies ... not a hockey puck .	-1
Has a nice mellower taste than store bought heat-processed table salt.No Iodine , so I supplement with 4 drops of good tasting Liquid DulseBernard Jensen Products - Liquid Dulse , 4 oz liquid ( also Very good to FILL thyroid with GOOD iodine ! - Keeps from taking in any Radioactive iodine from Japan reactor spill ! - Radioactive iodine does Permanent damage to thyroid , and ca n't be reversed ! Radioactivity is sure to work into our food supply ... ! ) Per my dentist ( for everyone ) - I started gargling with 1/4tsp salt in 8oz of water after brushing.It is VERY unnerving to see the undissolved black/brown specs floating around ! The other unprocessed sea salt brands come from `` Less '' pristine waters , but I 'll give them a try next time .	-1
I purchased Erin 's Bakers becuase I thought it was made from a true vegan . I read the ingredients and there was nothing but preservatives and it had egg whites in it . Last I checked vegans do not eat any sort of animal products ! Also this cookie spikes up your sugar levels drastically ! !	-1
This item is not like any cookie I 've ever met . I am not sure what to call it . It 's large , 3 oz . and 300 calories . It looks like a thick patty . It is dense and chewy . I bought the double chocolate chunk flavor . It has a mild cocoa flavor with notes of prune and bitter coffee . It is only slightly sweet , and has a hint of medicinal quality . Though listed in the ingredients , I could not find a single chocolate chunk that was large enough to differentiate from the rest of the heavy , soft patty . Most of the doughy thing is chewable but there are small grains of something that are distinctly harder and got caught in the cusps of my molars.If you are too busy to enjoy your food or ca n't taste anything anyway , maybe these are for you . For me , when I spend 300 calories , even on the run , I want something that makes my mouth happy . Half a whole wheat English muffin , a tablespoon of natural peanut butter , half a banana sliced on top . All around better ! And no messier to eat because these patties are crumbly and a slightly sticky . You 'll have bits on your upholstry and traces on the steering wheel.Reformulate , Erin ! Food should be a healthy PLEASURE .	-1
This is gross . The calories are very high and the product does not taste good . If anyone has had odawalla bars , this cookie has that taste . This could be worse than those bars . For something with 300 calories , I would expect it to have a decent taste . Do n't waste your money on this product.If you look at the ingredients , they are the same for almost all flavors of this cookie . So basically , all the other flavors will have a similar flavor.If this product is improved , maybe more people will buy it.Expect to use the bathroom more when using this product . This is a plus and a negative .	-1
We 've only had the peanut butter cookie . The family did n't care for it . We could n't taste the peanut butter and actually spread peanut butter on the cookie to give it some taste . We 're not giving up and will try the chocolate chunk next .	-1
I bought this 12 pack so that I would have no excuse to skip breakfast anymore ; it has a great list of healthy ingredients , under 300 calories , freezer storage is recommended/preferred which means pretty much always fresh stock on hand , toast-able , and easy to grab and go . Along with the other list of pluses and pros , these are *very* filling . The con happens to be the taste - very little banana flavor at all . Mostly a sort of bland , vague flavor that I would have to label as `` fiber '' since it did not taste all that much like anything.Baker 's Breakfast Cookies tend to get high marks and I would definitely try a different flavor if these were n't so expensive , but unfortunately this flavor ( or lack of it ) has me a little reluctant to invest another morning or dollar in this brand .	-1
I ordered both the banana nut + the oatmeal raisin and would return both if Amazon would let me . There is utterly no taste to these other than a foul aftertaste . Consistency of moist cardboard . For 290 calories , I 'd rather have something with some sort of flavor .	-1
These Sweetleaf `` flavored '' products are only for people who want something really sweet with just the very barest whiff of some flavor ( you probably wo n't even be able to tell which one it is ) . If you 're looking for a product that 's about half sweetness and half flavor , THIS IS N'T IT . I urge you to save your money and look for another solution .	-1
I just do n't like the taste of Stevia and it is overpowering.I poured the bottle down the drain.Instead of flavored stevia water , I now drink Canfield 's Lemon Seltzer water . No sweeteners .	-1
Hard to rate higher a tasty soup when my purpose is to warn you that this is the second time this particular soup has arrived badly dented - so much so that it was dangerous to open . One order had 10 of 12 cans unusable ! The other order was from several months ago and had 4 of the 12 badly dented . Sorry to say that we wo n't be ordering this again even tho ' the price is so good compared to at the local foodstore.As always , Amazon came through with their promise to serve the customer fairly and well . They refunded the order with no hiccups ! Thank you Amazon . I will continue to order items that are not so `` iffy '' regarding shipping care .	-1
I wo n't be buying this soup again any time soon . It was all potatoes and had very little clam flavor . And besides the price being outrageous , it was just not worth the calories . Give it a try and see what you think ?	-1
I had stopped purchasing this brand over a year ago due to dented cans , but thought I 'd try them again , but found 11 out of 12 cans to be badly dented inside the shrink wrapped flat although the shipping container was fine Amazon was kind enough to refund , but in the future , I will stick to my favorite soups , Amy 's , which are always in perfect condition .	-1
I 've been craving New England Clam Chowder and it has been so long since I 've had it , I can not remember who has the good stuff . I tried shopping at Whole Paycheck and they had this and one other brand so I thought I would give it a try . It was very bland and not worth the calories or the trouble of heating it up . I would definitely not purchase this again . I noticed that every other reviewer as of today has given this soup 1 star only as well ; I guess I wonder who likes it ? what was wolfgang thinking ?	-1
The soup is rich and tasty , but DO N'T buy it from Amazon . The packaging is so poor that the cans arive dented as did the replacement shipment . I got my money back but now have to pay more to buy this wonderful soup from my local grocer .	-1
This soup is somewhat thin and bland for a New England clam chowder . I like the non-organic Wolfgang Puck New England clam chowder a lot better ( red label cans ) . Even the cheap Progresso clam chowder at Costco is tastier than this .	-1
the broth is tasty , with the addition of a little more salt and pepper . The carrots stand up to the heating , ditto the noodles , but the chicken is worse than anything Campbell 's would put in a can , and precious-little of it . I fished the meagre FIVE chunks of it out and gave it to the dogs , who did n't seem to mind.Wo n't buy this again .	-1
I 'm reviewing the Organic Chicken and Egg Noodles soup . I 'm puzzled by the reviews that rave about the soup -- the only thing I can think of is that perhaps they are reviewing different kinds . This particular soup is not worth the money . You will need to get a magnifying glass to see the chicken . The egg noodles are `` okay . '' You 'll get lots of water and celery , so if you like that , then this is for you . The flavor is good , but not better than the various canned soups you buy at the grocery store . I 'd say save your money .	-1
I just do n't get the rave reviews this is getting . A more truthful product name would be `` Bay Leaf Soup '' , because that is the only flavor I can distinguish.Pick out a carrot and eat it , pick out a potato and eat it , tomato , celery , it does n't matter , there is no individual flavor to any of it . A spoonful of the broth alone taste exactly like a spoonful of carrots alone , and that is predominately bay leaf.To each his own I guess , but I just do n't get it .	-1
Saw this on the store shelf recently after not seeing Wolfgang Puck soups available for purchase in a long time . The previous red label non `` organic '' version of this soup was one of the best I 've tasted . I remember the broth being thick and creamy , the dumplings had perfect texture and size . The chicken pieces were white and well portioned . It was a great soup . This version however is watered down with minuscule portions of ingredients . The chicken pieces are tiny dark slivers . There are more carrots in this soup than anything else . The dumplings are the most confusing part because they are tiny little hard squares . Can you even call them dumplings ? The broth/water of the soup is completely flavorless . This is n't soup but more like some rationed gruel from a WW2 prison camp . It really is that terrible.I used to love Wolfgang Puck soups but I wo n't buy them again after this . It 's too bad . I have no idea what they were thinking when they made this version .	-1
A waste of $ . and calories . : ( I bought a can at a nearby natural foods market yesterday . Just ate it for dinner tonight and boy was it completely unimpressive . The only redeeming quality is that it contains free-range chicken , and that garners only 1 star.This `` soup '' consisted of 2 little square pieces of chicken , about 2 spoonfuls of rice , 7 carrot pieces and lots of blandish pooky tasting broth . I will never buy this crap or eat it again . The best part about it was the packet of wendy 's saltines that i added .	-1
I purchased this very very pricy soup on sale at my local Publix in their Greenwise section . It 's typically $ 3.99 per can , but I caught a sale . I bought just one can to give it a try.I agree with many of the other reviewers ' comments , but I have a different take ... He should be ashamed to put his name on this can.I found 4 bits of what was passing as dumplings , 4 bits of celery , 3 chunks of what looked like processed canned chicken cubes , bits of carrots , lots of white potato , water , water , water , and more water.I did n't need to eat it with a spoon because I could have poured it into a glass and drank it -- very watery . The soup is not at all similair to the label which has hearty chunky ingredients like a stew.The flavor was mild and not half bad , but the quality control for such a pricy soup should be better . I expected more gourmet for my money than I would have with most commercial brands that you can buy at the dollar store.Pros : Nice packagingPacking made from recycled materialsOrganicMinimal preparation -- heat and eat quicklyCons : Lacks flavorPoor ingredientsHigh sodium content 680 mg.7 g of fat280 cal per can Not a 16 oz can , rather a 14.5 oz . canI give this soup a 5/5 for packaging , 0/5 for ingredients , and 2/5 for flavor . I like mild soups , but the lack of quality ingredients at this price really makes me pause . I do not recommend .	-1
I can see the appeal of these honey roasted peanuts since they have 3x the salt and sugar of other brands , but for me the salty-sweetness was excessive , leaving a burning sensation in my throat . These peanuts contain almost 30 % sugar by weight , and the sugar and corn syrup annihilate the honey flavor that I appreciate in other brands . I also found several small and one large chunk of peanutless coating in my container , forcing me to watch out lest I end up with a mouthful of sugar . While these might be a replacement for a candy bar , the low peanut content ( only 3.2oz ) makes them expensive , and the chunks of coating make them defective.A two-star product : I over-correct for the perfect reviews of the sugar-fiends .	-1
I found it amusing how much trouble Amazon went to explaining that `` orange pekoe '' has no orange in it , when in fact this tea leaf is 95 % fanning . you will need 1.5g per 8oz cup of tea , so at 220g this box yields about 150 tea bags worth of the same cardboard bland tea . The tea arrives completely dried out in a foil & paper ; envelope , so I would not bother moving it to a sealed tin since it 's already been ruined . Next time buyDilmah Tea , 100 % Pure Ceylon Tea , Loose Leaf , 4.41-Ounce Boxes ( Pack of 6 ) which costs double , but also yields double the amount of far more flavorful black tea and is vacuum packed at the source like all loose not blended teas should be .	-1
We did n't particularly care for this loose tea , we usually drink loose tea but this had a funny taste to it ; my husband thinks something was mixed in beside the tea itself . Would not recommend .	-1
I am totally addicted to the ice tea at Panera and after discovering that they use loose tea in their brewer , thought I would give this a try before moving on to the more expensive teas . I guess you get what you pay for as I find this tea nothing like Panera . It is bitter no matter what strength I make it . I guess you get what you pay for . And by the way , it was only $ 4.50 for the box when I purchased it two weeks ago and now it has almost doubled in price . What 's up with that Amazon ?	-1
I honestly do not like it . I tried to drink it several times hoping to acclimate myself to the taste , all to no avail . So , I brought the packets to the office and put them on the `` free-for-all '' counter in the breakroom so my co-workers could have it . They did n't have a fancy for it either . As a matter-of-fact , somebody shoved it way to the back of the cabinet and put a bunch of other stuff in front of it so we did n't even have to see it . It 's horrible , I tell you . I finally just threw them all away .	-1
I looked forward to trying this tea based on a few reviews I read here , so when the chance came to give it a try from the local grocery store before committing to buying bulk from Amazon , I jumped at it . It sounded delicious ! My disappointment was huge : I 've never had a powdered drink as foul as this . There was an overwhelming taste of butane or some acrid fuel tasting chemical once the powder was mixed . I tried it several times over a span of six weeks to be sure that my taste buds were n't just off for a day . Maybe in 2006 when the earliest reviews were posted , it was good , but the formula must have changed . It 's not my first disappointment from Lipton , but it will be the last time I purchase a Lipton tea product . I 'm so glad I avoided buying the case quantity . My advice -- -try a smaller package first !	-1
And the tea lacks a citrus-y scent unless you add water to it . When water is added , the scent and taste are slightly reminiscent of canned mandarin oranges . This tea is better than your usual Lipton tea , but only by a little : The leaves are bigger , and not as oxidized.There are no oranges in this tea , just peaches and mangoes , with natural mandarin orange flavor . As others have mentioned before , the teabags are indeed made from plastic , and if you drink with your teabags in , you risk drawing out a plastic taste in the tea . I have , and it made the rest of the tea undrinkable.Just do yourself a favor , and skip this tea . Find another brand instead of giving Lipton money for this joke of a tea .	-1
Save your money and buy Ramen noodles instead . These have lots of noodles and broth but hardly any flavor .	-1
We love oriental food , and this looked like a good idea to buy and try . I am sorry to say , that this product tasted so & # 34 ; bad & # 34 ; to us , we only ate about half of a serving . Honestly , the taste was extremely cloying , bland , almost to the point of making us gag . This product left a terrible aftertaste to us , full of lingering garlic . We took the suggestions of some other reviewers , adding canned Chinese veggies ( we had no frozen ones available ) . I tried adding a bit of soy sauce , and a dash or two of Chinese five spice . Nothing did much to improve it . If you try it , you may really like it . But for a respected company ( Knorr/Lipton ) , this is something that we will not buy again . I give the product only the one star , because you ca n't go lower and still rate it . I will state that the actual noodle , after preparation , ( you can not separate the noodle from a flavor packet as you can with most instant raman products ) , was a higher quality instant noodle than a regular instant raman noodle , in our opinion .	-1
I had really high hopes for the & # 34 ; Knorr/Lipton Noodles & Sauce , Asian Teriyaki & # 34 ; product , as the Teriyaki Rice is my favorite , These are really lacking taste and have an odd taste that I can not identify.I realize that taste is subjective , but if you like the Rice version , do n't count on this even being close to it . Good luck , try at your own risk .	-1
I usually love these Knorr/Lipton Rice & Pasta Sides & thought the Teriyaki would 1 of my top 3 flavors ( especially knowing how I love my sweet & savory flavors ) . Boy , was I wrong ( I never know whether or not to put ? marks after this type of questions ) . I do n't know exactly what that gross flavor is ( maybe the tamarind ? ) , but these noodles have a really weird aftertaste , in my opinion ( & another reviewer 's ) . This will not stop me from trying the rice version of the Teriyaki flavor , but I know to stay away from the noodles . Since I always like putting extra soy sauce & teriyaki sauce on my chow mein noodles , I really thought I would love these Asian ones , but surprisingly not the case .	-1
my mother was not a great cook . she could only cook in two ways..almost burned , or burned . but she used to make killer spaghetti with what i thought was lawry 's spaghetti sauce . i just made it and its too bland ( i used plenty of spices ) and a little bitter ( i threw in a hefty amt of sugar ) so after eating it i then recalled the mix she used to use not lawry 's but durkees . anyway i guess i 'm stuck with this till i use it up . if anyone has any ideas for better taste other than the 1/2 pound of spices i used please let me know . thank you	-1
I bought it because the reviews on amazon are great.None of the family members think this is better than regular seasoning . Actually its worse.I regret buying a whole box .	-1
These are just awful . I love all kinds of toasted cheese , but simply could n't eat these . Fed them to the dogs .	-1
Ugh ! I sure had high hopes and I was bitterly disappointed . These things were just nasty . I LOVE their other products ( `` just the cheese '' ) but not these things.I even heated them up as suggested but they did n't get better .	-1
not good at all . had to throw them away because no one would eat them . Was very disappointed and it was a waste of money	-1
This is a good idea ( I think ) , but the taste is TOO dry and the butter flavor is awful . I made it through half a bag and could n't force myself to eat the rest . Stick with fresh cheese as a snack , this is not a good substitute .	-1
ORIGINAL REVIEW ( Jan 2008 ) : I do n't know what it is about these , but I LOVE THEM . I was n't sure at first , but they have an addictive quality ... crunchy at first , then they melt & dissolve in your mouth . And then it hit me . These taste like CHEESE CURDS . As a Wisconsin native , all I can say is YUMMY ! If you do n't know what CHEESE CURDS , you might not want this to be your first experience . Just sayin'.But , four-stars , rather than 5 due to saltiness -- even the lower salt is a bit too salty. -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -UPDATE ( Aug 2010 ) : I just ordered again , my third or fourth time placing an order with Amazon . This time the Popped Cheese was STALE , soft , and old although expiration is for May-2011 . Clearly , this food product is not being stored properly and/or the manufacturing has changed . I wo n't order them again.I have changed my rating . Now , 1 star for unacceptable , barely edible , food product .	-1
... as is most tea that you buy in a grocery store . If you want good , full flavored tea , do n't get Lipton or most of the other run of the mill store brands . Go for Traditional Medicinals , Good Earth or order loose leaf tea from somewhere like Adagio Teas . You may pay a little more but you 'll get real tea that tastes really good . You 'll wonder how you were able to drink stuff like this for so long .	-1
the bag is made of plastic which is not compostable . I wanted to give this tea a higher grade especially after reading about Lipton 's commitment to sustainable growing and certification by the RainForest Alliance , but then they blew it with a plastic bag . Since tea is the ultimate soil enhancer , I regularly discard my used tea leaves on house plants and then outdoor plants and pots ( even in the dead of winter awaiting spring ) . I 've cancelled my Subscribe & Save and will return to loose teas especially the Rishi and Octavia organic white flavored teas and Celestial Seasonings in a paper bag .	-1
I bought this for the first time and did n't expect too much to begin with , but it ended up disappointing me anyway . On the front of the box it said `` Now with bigger noodles . '' If these are bigger noodles , then what were they before ... invisible . The box cover was very misleading . I ended up making two packages because there are n't that many noodles in one packet , but it was so salty that I had to guzzle down water afterward .	-1
Each packet of this soup is NOT single serving size ! ... and the packaging does very little to correct that misperception : the soup is shown in a coffee mug-sized scenario . You 're supposed to add 4 cups of water to each packet ; which is more soup than anyone is looking for at lunchtime . Even when you add all that water to the mix , I hope you 're on a starvation diet , because the serving size on the box is 2 tablespoons ! ! ! ! TWO TABLESPOONS ! What are you supposed to do with 4 cups of chicken soup ( with a stray micro-noodle floating by now and then ) when your alloted portion is two tablespoons ? You 're supposed to forget that consuming a reasonable amount of soup fills you with 100 percent ( if not more ) of your daily sodium intake.This is an absurd product .	-1
I am really mad at Lipton for all the changes they keep making to their CLASSIC soups that have been the same for years . Honestly , the new versions with `` bigger noodles '' and `` extra noodles '' seem more like a lousy attempt to cut costs and sneak in cheaper ingredients and masquerade this as a `` better '' version of the original many of us grew up with . I have been freaking out trying to find the original version and all I can find are bigger noodles , extra noodles and the kind with dried chicken jerky chunks and they are ALL horrible tasting and not the same as the original ! First of all , it used to have little GREEN parsley flakes to add flavor . We see them on the box . Why are they no longer in the soup ? FYI Lipton , the picture on the box should LOOK more like the product ! Are you afraid that the real soup is n't appetizing looking enough ? Well ... maybe that 's because it 's TERRIBLE and does n't look remotely like the picture anymore ! Whoever thought this was a good idea needs to be fired ... seriously . It 's bad marketing and false advertisement ! Secondly , the noodles ... The `` new '' noodles are too thick and they taste doughy and weird , they take forever to cook and once they are tender enough , they seem gross , soggy and overcooked . There are also so many noodles now , the broth tastes like water because they absorb ALL the flavor , especially the salt . Did anyone at Lipton TASTE this product before trying to force it on consumers ? Or did they think nobody would notice this cheap tasting , salty and soggy-noddle imitation that they put in the same box ? Thirdly , I have been using this for a certain chicken soup recipe for YEARS and everyone loves it . Now it comes out too salty and the noodles break apart when it stands too long . This never happened before with this product . I am fine with companies coming out with new versions of things . But why not keep the ORIGINAL version the way it was before and add new varieties ? Lots of people feed this to kids , the elderly , the sick and people with digestive issues . Changing a food product that people rely on for health reasons is a very poor idea . I do n't think Lipton thought about all their loyal customers before making this change to the product . I have stomach issues and have to watch what I eat . I am not sure if it was the nasty taste or some ingredients they changed but the `` bigger noodle '' version upsets my stomach . It never used to.I have stopped buying this brand completely now . They just have messed with the product TOO much over the years and it does n't taste like it used to . First , they took out most of the parsley and herbs to flavor it , now they KEEP changing the noodles , making soups with more , bigger and never as good as the original . I ca n't believe they would do this ! It would be like trying to change the taste of Coke , Pepsi , Twinkies or any other classic product . I have stopped buying Lipton and now I buy the Ralphs brand because it tastes good and more like Lipton USED to taste like in the old days . Ralphs also does n't keep changing the package , the content and putting silly , confusing cartoons all over it like it 's a kid 's cereal box . Maybe Lipton will take a hint when people stop buying their `` new '' and terrible tasting products ! BAD JOB LIPTON !	-1
Doesnt taste good and I love ginger . I even grated some ginger to add to it and it didnt help the flavor . With that said , if you want to try it for cheap , `` Big Lots '' has it for less than $ 2 a box .	-1
I tried the tea out because i was interested in trying out non-traditional teas . The box was relatively cheap at $ 1.99 at my local grocery , so i figured , why not ? Because i like vanilla and caramel , i figured this would be a hit , however i was a bit disappointed . The taste is very rich and musky , and you definitely get a lot of flavor , but i found that i just do n't particularly enjoy that flavor at all . It all just tastes strangely artificial to me , and i do n't even really enjoy the smell of it from the box . Speaking of the box , the packaging leaves a lot to be desired , for while the little pyramid filters are cute , they are not individually sealed , so you have to make sure you have a canister to store it all , or else you 'll definitely risk losing quality and freshness .	-1
I have been buying this tea for years now . Previously , the tea was neither muddy in taste or in appearance . This new box , however , had tons of tiny & # 34 ; specks & # 34 ; of what I assume was overground black tea . The box was full of these specks , the teabags leaked black specks in my cup ... it was a real mess . It looked more like floor sweepings than cut tea . If they are going to persist in using the pyramid bags , they need to go back to a coarser grind so it will not sift through the bag . It was nasty to look at and worse to drink . I use loose tea as well , but it is usually larger grind or whole leaf and it settles to the bottom when it is brewed . This stuff was so fine , it went right through my strainer when I tried to minimize the particles . The taste was okay , not great . They had skimped on the caramel flavor a bit . If the flavor had of been superb , I could have maybe overlooked the grit . But it was bad , even for LIPTON . I would not recommend this tea .	-1
I bought a box of this at a local big box store because it 's inexpensive and I wanted to like it . Whatever the & # 34 ; natural flavors & # 34 ; are , they taste like the cheap scented candles you get at gas stations- fake perfume , melted plastic , and chemical ick.I may use these to dye craft projects . I would not feed them to someone I did n't like . No idea how vanilla and caramel can go this horribly wrong .	-1
The only thing that impressed me was the speed to prepare -- -the so-called brownie was like a piece of kids chocolate cake with the choco syrup -- you can do better at the Little Debbie shelf at the local supermaket . The price was absurd if it was on a half price discount and then I would be looking for an ice cream coupon . Sorry folks , not worth the money .	-1
To put it in no uncertain terms - these are disgusting . They were not broken , but the taste is terrible . They have a stale taste , but they also had a slight chewy texture - just do n't buy them - you will regret it . I had one bite and threw the whole pack away . I ca n't believe they are still on the market .	-1
Had this on automatic order . 3 orders ago most bars crumbly , 2 orders ago most bars crumbly , last order stale and crumbly . Reported this but no response . Unfortunate since when previously ordered most bars intact and fresh . Must be a shipper problem ? No longer on automatic reorder . Will purchase elsewhere .	-1
Sorry ... I really wanted to like this . When I first opened it , it definitely had a nutty smell and a nice texture of peanut butter spread throughout the bar . And when I bit into it , there is a nice creaminess of peanut butter mixed throughout the crunchy bar . But unfortunately there is a very strong , odd chemical taste mixed into the slightly peanut-buttery taste ( I know that description may seem weird , but that 's the only way I can describe it ) . I did eat the bar ( I was really hungry ) , but I would not buy these again .	-1
tastes terrible	-1
looks good from the package but does n't taste good at all . hard crunchy freeze dried flavor.save your money guys !	-1
I really do love these snacks , BUT , the Grilled Cheese flavor is absolutely horrible ! PLEASE pick another flavor unless you 've tried this one and are sure you like it ... This one is not a winner , IMHO !	-1
These are definitely the worst snack I have ever purchased in my life . Dry as the Sahara Desert , not much taste , and way overpriced . Save your hard-earned money for something else .	-1
I hate to write a bad review , but it was so bad , we had to throw them away , or just let them sit in my cupboard . No one in my family would eat them . I tried to eat them because I did not want to waste the money , but they were so strong and salty they made me sick to my stomach . I was very disappointed , I was looking forward to something lighter , maybe crunchy ? These were very heavy little cheese bricks dipped in a very strong cheesy salty flavor ... Nasty ... 8 out of 8 of us agreed ...	-1
This was shipped and not forwarded and now I 've been charge and the word is that the box has been returned to amazon with this and 6 other things in the shipment !	-1
I would not buy these again . They are so salty and leave a briney aftertaste . Can be used as croutons for soup or salad , but not just eaten plain . It makes for very expensive coutons . Great concept , but poor execution .	-1
I had high hopes for this product , but was very disappointed . It was STALE and very salty . Oh Well ; Live and Learn ... ..	-1
Just awful ! ! tastes like old cheese that has been over cooked in the microwave ! way too expensive for the tiny little bags you get just not worth it ! ! I could n't have been more disappointed and could not have been more sorry for having ordered any of these ! a big waste of money I should have just bought the cheese ! I would have gotten a lot more for my money ! !	-1
I saw these made on the TV show `` Unwrapped '' , and they sounded like something I 'd enjoy . Wrong . These cheese is n't sharp enough and they add way too much salt - it 's all I can taste .	-1
I used to eat `` Just the Cheese '' when it was in bigger bags a few years ago and they were good . But the snack size are just too salty.No problems with seller though . I received my order quickly .	-1
I love cheese . I find myself to be something of a cheese snob so I was not the first person in my family to attempt to eat this product . The first person who tried to consume this inedible food substance spit it out of his mouth rightly into the trash . Noting this behavior which is unusual for him , I simply had to try to consume this & # 34 ; just the cheese & # 34 ; low carb snack . It did in fact taste like some sort of burnt , VERY CHEAP , cheese but holds an after taste that I can not relate to any other food source that I have tried in the past . In addition to this the lofty price paid was not worth the small bags delivered . They are about a quarter of the size of the nut bags/tubes that are sold near the checkouts at the food markets . The one person in our family who will eat anything did try these as well , stated they were not & # 34 ; too bad & # 34 ; , but has not touched the box since . I would love to get my money back on this product and if there was a way to do this I would gladly take part in whatever action needed to be taken but I will certainly not purchase any of the other & # 34 ; flavors & # 34 ; provided on the sell page . I question the reasons why this product is still even on the market .	-1
I was really disappointed when I opened my box of snacks yesterday . This product claimed to be pure cheese and even says it contains no MSG when in fact it has autolyzed yeast , maltodextrin and yeast extract . For those who do n't know those are just synonyms for MSG but they hide it under any name they can . Check out the site [ ... ]	-1
I did n't care for these.. - Gave them to my goats as random treats ( which was n't very healthy for them ) - I got them when doing low carb , they were very low carb but nothing like normal cheese crunches or puffs..Very salty .. Maybe a acquired taste ? My goats loved them- Just not for me	-1
I live in Wisconsin and love cheese of all kinds . This was nasty . This was not baked cheese in the least . It was a crunchy , salty , flavorless lump . There were only a few whole pieces in the bag and a couple of crumbs . Someone was not packing based on weight that day . I will eat real cheese any day . It is more filling to eat a chunk of real cheese . Plus real white cheddar can be left non-refrigerated for up to two weeks and still be safe to eat ! Just call Mars Cheese Castle and ask them all about it .	-1
I love crunchy cheese goodies . I thought these White Cheddar Just the Cheese snacks would be a nice little treat but when I tried them , I thought I had bitten into a salt lick . I have never eaten cheese that was even half as salty as these little bits . They were toasty and crunchy but the salt overwhelms everything . I wo n't be reordering .	-1
I wish I had noticed the list of ingredients before I purchased this product . It is not just cheese . Read the ingredients . MSG is bad for you and there are about 15 ingredients besides the cheese . YUCK ! I will throw them out . They do n't taste that great either .	-1
This product was really bad ... way too salty , very small and tasted gritty and-I noticed afterwards-that even the pkg . smelled awful ! Guess I can use them in soup or Not ! [ I only clicked one star because there was n't a no-stars or minus-one star available ... ] ! I called to leave a message ; and am waiting to hear from customer service ... will update if/when they call me back . One week later-no callback ... I 'll bet they have gotten plenty complaints . I 'll call back Monday [ and Tues. , and Weds. , etc . ; and report back ! After , at least , three weeks of calling , waiting for a callback , and leaving messages ; I have n't heard a word . I 'd bet that they have heard these complaints ALOT ... and ca n't be bothered . How rude ... 'Jenny ' is the CSR who was , hopefully , supposed to call back ... or not ! Amazon-I hope you no longer carry these 'products ' out of concern for people who actually think they are buying edible snacks [ while only wasting money ] . When , in reality , hungry birds and fish wo n't even eat them ! Update : When I finally got in touch ; the csr told me that I should request a refund from Amazon ! [ I do n't know if Amazon gives refunds [ or credit ] in this situation . Is that how these issues are handled ? I will ck . on this . It is enough to keep others from dealing with this company ; and the gross product that birds and fishes [ let alone human beings ] would not-and could not-eat !	-1
I really do like the little bags of snacks from this company , but the bars are too weird . They are basically the same , but shaped like a bar . But it 's not the same as popping a disc into your mouth and snacking on it like a chip or something . I 'm not really sure what this one was trying to emulate . Maybe a granola bar ? I dunno , the taste was similar to me , but it was ... weird.They are also ( like the snack bite things ) very salty ) .I 'd stick to things like theJust the Cheese Mini Round Snacks , Classic White Cheddar , 0.5-Ounce Bags ( Pack of 16 ) if you want a crunch - or look for their lower salt versions if you are watching sodium .	-1
This cheese is baked until crunchy and is a low carb , low calorie snack . It tastes burnt and is extremely crunchy , like tooth breaking crunchy . I will not buy it again .	-1
I am always looking for sources of protein for my teenage vegetarian son so I thought I 'd try these bars - also the price was right . My kids tried them and wo n't ever eat them again . The texture is exactly like styrofoam . I 'd have to say that the flavor is ok , it is salty but I like that . I did n't like the texture either but it is low in calories , 70 for the bar . Since I 'll be eating the whole box it 's good that there is something good I can say about them .	-1
An entire case of snacks that will be discarded . Inedible . Dry , horrible tasting . I wish I had seen this other review before purchasing .	-1
These seemed to be a great low-carb easy-to-carry snack items . NOT ! They were easy to carry but everything else was a bust . Dry as dust and unpleasant in the mouth , far too salty to be pleasant , just all around a bad idea .	-1
The yogurt coating has kind of an artificial sweetener taste to it . The granola bars are n't bad , but not my first choice . Still , they were cheap and I 'll eat them when I am hungry enough . Would n't buy them again though .	-1

After reading the other reviews I was under the impression that I would I too would like Vanilla ... Well , after receiving my mine I was really disappointed with the flavor . It 's just & # 34 ; yucky & # 34 ; , that 's probably the best way to put it , would n't even feed vanilla bar to my dog if I had one , hell I would n't feed it to my boss .	-1
It tastes terrible . I guess you could pass it off as incredibly sharp cheddar , but I recommend you buy a bag and try them before you buy 12 bags . Like I did .	-1
One of my friends is on a low carb diet and let me try these . I thought they tasted okay . After I ate a couple of them I was reading the ingredient list and noticed that they contain maltodextrin.I was recently diagnosed with type 2 diabetes and as per my endocrinologist , maltodextrin is on the `` ingredients to avoid '' list because it raises blood glucose ( blood sugar ) . Maltodextrin is a filler found in lots of sugar free products and apparently some low carb products as well . It 's in sugar free Jello , liquid sugar free coffee creamers , etc.I ca n't recall the exact terms my endocrinologist used but it boils down to the fact that your pancreas treats the maltodextrin pretty much the same way it would if you ingested table sugar . He said if you have pre-diabetes , a family history of diabetes or are a diabetic then you should avoid products with maltodextrin.I gave these 2 stars in part because of the maltodextrin ( cheap filler ) and in part because they just did n't taste that good to me .	-1
Simply bought the wrong flavor . These are puffy like those desserts made with Rice Crispies and marshmallow Fluff . They even have a layer of cashew-flavored and beig colored `` chocolate . '' Will not buy again .	-1
Pros : ( 1 ) Tasty ! That 's the main reason I bought it . Love the melted peanut taste . Addictive ! Yum . ( 2 ) Well , because it 's small , it 's easy to carry around . Lovely dessert.Cons : ( 1 ) The bar gets smaller and smaller , while the price stays the same - as other reviewers have pointed out . It 's almost half the original size now . ( 2 ) I consider it an unethical business practice to mail out products with an expiration date in 2 months , and fail to disclaim this piece of critical information in the description . The vendor should not sell nearly-expired products like this ! ( 3 ) Please note that there are many ARTIFICIAL COLORINGS used in this product , and there is PALM OIL used . Those who are health conscious might want to take note of this . ( I bought it because I did n't read the ingredient list carefully , but you should . )	-1
Well I got my cookies alright ... the packaging has snowflakes , I thought wow fresh stuff since I have a little Betty Crocker experience they are probably not going to Expire till 2014 ! WRONG , they expire Oct 2013 in less than 20 days , 12 packs that expire so Quickly . Most fresh Betty Crocker stuff you find in your grocery store has a expiration date usually for up to a year ... NEVER , NEVER , NEVER LESS THAN 1 MONTH ! I will be returning this immediately !	-1
I used to eat these a long time ago . Then I learned about the dangers of high fructose corn syrup . Let 's hope one day everybody will learn about the dangerous ingredients in so many packaged foods . And this is what they call `` healthy '' ?	-1
I had my hopes for this bar . The box reads `` Fruit & Nut - Almond , Raisin , Peanut , and Cranberry '' , but after taking my first bite , I was surprised by the actual ingredients . The first two ingredients in the nutritional information are Oats and High Maltose Corn Syrup . This is not a fruit and nut bar . It is a grain bar with some fruit and nuts sprinkled in . There are far better products , including ones with almonds and fruits as the main ingredients , and with honey sticking the ingredients together instead of a boat load of corn syrup . I am completely dissatisfied and amazon does n't offer returns on this product so save yourself some money and buy a better bar .	-1
This is the sort of bar that you would find in the grocery store . Nature Valley is a General Mills product . Very average , and you would n't expect much from it . The second ingredient ( to whole grain oats ) is high maltose corn syrup . Not an optimal ingredient , as we are learning . The other ingredients are eh , so so . They taste fine , a bit sweet , but edible . There are 3 grams of protein in each bar , 140 calories , and each bar weighs 1.2 ounces . That is about 4 bites worth for most adults , probably average for these kinds of `` grocery store '' bars . On the plus side , if you are need something that does n't melt ; chocolate coatings , etc . this would work for you .	-1
Well , it 's filling , and fairly low-calorie at 140 for the bar . I had high hopes for this bar , given the promise of fruit and nuts , which is reinforced by the packaging that prominently features pictures of raisins , almonds , peanuts and cranberries . Opening the package is the first of the disappointments . The primary ingredient is oats , followed closely by corn syrup . Tiny specks of cranberry , raisin and almond , with a few peanut chunks . The flavor is very sweet with a bitter aftertaste . This is not a product I would recommend or choose to purchase .	-1
I would love to review this product . However , it was shipped and never left the warehouse . It 's been two weeks -- still sitting there .	-1
Amazon goofed on this one . It tastes about as much like real gingerbread as a cow looks like a pig . I 'm familiar with both as I grew up on a farm and we had great homemade gingerbread . This product bakes into a rubbery , hard to remove from the pan , hard to cut , hard to eat something-or-other for which I have no name . I 'd strongly advise you to go with , say , Duncan Hines , or some local product and leave Betty to those who do n't want quality . If you bake four of them in round pans they 'd be very good for wheels to replace those on your little one 's little red wagon . I now have 11 more boxes of this mess in my shelves and have no idea what I can do with it . The tires on my power chair are not the right size for replacement by this product . And I do n't own a little red wagon !	-1
I brought this snack based on all the positive reviews and was utterly dissatisfied . These nuts ( cashews ? ? ? ) are soft and borderline stale . I did not taste any soy and had to concentrate to taste any pineapple . I received 6 packs and did not finish 1 . I really feel duped by all the positive reviews for this brand and I am wondering if these people work for Sahale . It is though a great snack because you will not be tempted to eat any more ( one star ) .	-1
I am always looking for quality nutricious treats for my teens . I bought the samplers to see if anyone had a favorite.Sorry to say that we just did not like any of these . A little too spicy and we were looking for crunch and got chewy .	-1
I love this flavor larabar , but the box of these that I received were INCREDIBLY stale . The bars were all dry and harder than normal texture and they crumbled when you bit into them , which is not typically how a larabar should taste . The taste was also dull and old , as if they had been sitting in the warehouse too long . I will buy these from the supermarket from now on instead of through amazon .	-1
It may be all natural but it is too bitter ! My cherry pies are tart but not sour like these bars , I really wish I had tried a different flavor because as of now I will never buy another Larabar ever . Again I say Yuck Yuck ! !	-1
I bought these on sale from Warehouse Deals , they 're expiring soon . I may or may not finish the whole box . They 're just ok . They 're definitely not good , or something I will ever crave . It just tastes like old , dried apples with a ton of cinnamon to try to cover up that you 're eating old apples . They are filling , or at least they make me not want to eat anything else for a while . In no way do these taste like apple pie . I get that Larabars are healthy , that 's why I bought them -- I needed another healthy snack option . But these taste like you would expect health food to taste back in the 80s , like fructose cookies or something . I eat lots of other healthy things that do n't taste like I 'm eating & # 34 ; health food. & # 34 ; It would be healthier and tastier to just eat a plain apple . Or go wild and sprinkle cinnamon on it !	-1
Maybe these are good for some people , but I find the combination of the flavor and texture to be not at all to my liking . I was really prepared to like these and find them quite disappointing . The packaging says & # 34 ; Gluten Free & # 34 ; in line with the latest nutritional fad and perhaps some gluten would have helped them . I shall not be buying them again .	-1
The dog refuses to eat these things even if I mix one with his favorite food which is all food .	-1
As an Indian , i must start by saying that in general we love cashews . there 's a whole array of sweets prepared using cashews as a base.When i got these , i figured id get something like it . but this was very disappointing . its tough to describe what they taste like . but the main ingredients are date and cashew powder.Here 's the kicker . i got a box of 16 of them . So suddenly as much as i want to like them and not waste them i cant figure out what to do . Thats when my wifey , suggested . take it to work . Well , i shared it with some colleagues . And most of them said the same thing ! I might be adding a biased review , but if thats the case , humble apologies.I give it an extra second star simply because its healthy stuff.Good luck fellas .	-1
I am not going to bash the company or its owner ! But to me , This bar just tastes WRONG , and ... it has a funny look when you take it out of the wrapper ... . like something a herbivorous animal would leave on your Spanish patio tiles .	-1
I purchased these through Warehouse Deals , and even though they still had not reached the & # 34 ; sell by & # 34 ; date ... the bars were covered in fuzzy white mold . Ick . I have bought many food items on Amazon and never had a problem with mold . I have bought many Larabars individually and in the 5 pack boxes and never had mold .	-1
Peanut butter , chocolate chip , sounds awesome right ? Sadly these bars are not . They are made out of dates and I am pretty sure that is the weird taste that I detect that I do not like . It kind of overpowers the chocolate and peanut butter and makes them taste weird and off . I thought I could not go wrong with 2 flavors that I love but I did . They are still sitting in my pantry until it either gets bar or they expire . They are just not that tasty .	-1
I 've tried several different flavors and they all turn my stomach . Nasty taste and I have no idea what these things are made from in the truth of things .	-1
This tastes like a fruit roll up smashed together- literally . Unfortunately even my 2 year old that eats anything and everything took a bite , chewed , got a weird look on her face , and handed the bar back to me ; so I 'll have to pawn these off on the church cookie table . ; ) I 'm so disappointed . : ( I also will note that this product does contain Soy for an FYI for anyone looking out for that .	-1
I like larabars , but this was my least favorite flavor out of the 8 or 10 I 've tried so far . It 's a bit sour if that makes sense ? I actually love cappuccinos and coffee flavored most things , but I would n't order this again .	-1
I got this just to try something new . I normally get the Luna Chocolate Dipped Coconut Bars , which I really like . These were a far cry from Luna . I could barely taste the coconut and it had a really weird , gritty texture that I did n't like . It had a mouth feel that I found a little disturbing . There was also a strange aftertaste that I could n't determine , but it was definitely unpleasant.If you want a coconut and chocolate energy/meal bar , I would not get this brand . Go for the Luna bars . It 's a much better experience .	-1
You better like the taste of dates as that 's all you taste with these bars . No way this should be called apple pie .	-1
Did not like these lemon bars . They had no taste of lemon . In fact they had a strange taste . Yucky !	-1
Larabars are one of the several natural companies that are fighting labeling GMO 's . Do n't buy them ! ! It is important for us to know what is in our food .	-1
I love Kind bars and when I saw this listed as a & # 34 ; fruit and nut food bar & # 34 ; I thought I was orderingsomething similar . I ordered the cherry pie flavor and it does taste like that but the texture islike you took the liquid part of cherry pie filling and made it thicker and formed it into a bar . Noactual pieces of fruit and no nuts , only a few tiny pieces scattered through out the & # 34 ; jelly & # 34 ; thatwere light in color and presumably are tiny nut flakes . This is more like the candy fruit slices yousee at the holidays than what I consider to be a fruit , nut bar . Did not like this at all .	-1
Everyone in my family shares my opinion that these things taste absolutely HORRIBLE . I feel really bad for someone who needs to eat Gluten/Dairy/Soy-free or Vegan/Kosher foods . If I had to live on these alone ( and I do n't ) , I 'd convert back to being a non-vegan or whatever . We all tried the Cherry Pie flavor , and what this thing has to do with cherry pies is way beyond me . It 's a lump of semi-solid goop with some nuts and dried fruits that taste sour and bitter and somewhat sticky . Simply gross to the point I could n't even finish one bar . I may not be a health food nut , but I know what tastes like crap when I taste it ... and these things are crap all the way . Steer clear . Even 1/2 hour after , I still have that horrible taste in my mouth and need to go brush my teeth to get rid of it .	-1
I truly love the flavor of this soup mix but it contains partially hydrogenated soybean oil . That means it has 'trans fats ' that effectively cause hardening of the arteries and heart disease . That 's not even mentioning that it has soybean products in it . Soybeans ( except for the fermented forms like tempah ) elevate one 's estrogen levels which can increase the chance of cancer risks ... especially estrogen mediated breast cancers . And it has Autolyzed Yeast Extract which is another name for the infamous neurotoxin ... .MSG ( monosodium glutamate ) . I do n't understand why this well known company has to use dangerous ingredients when there are so many substitutes that will not destroy our populations health . Is it purely because it 's so much cheaper to use these dangerous , life threatening products that they only see their profit margins and not the health of the nation . As much as I love the flavor of this soup mix , I can not recommend it to anyone ! I will not be ordering this health 'time bomb ' ever again . Eat it at your own risk ! ! !	-1
Not a real good flavor at all , taste like cheap bouillion cubes . Wish they would bring back cream of mushroom , tomato and split pea . I tried using it up to flavor gravy and other dishes . Would not buy it again .	-1
THIS IS SO TASTY BUT HAS WAY TOO MUCH SODIUM FOR ME . NOT GOOD FOR PEOPLE ON LOW SODIUM DIET .	-1
I ca n't believe I paid a nickle of my hard-earned money for this stuff.I also ca n't believe all the good reviews it got . You put it in a cup , add 3/4 cup of boiling water and stir it up . A bunch of white stuff that may be dried noodles will be floating on top . After a LOT MORE stirring , and it 's been sitting there for a while ( long enough to be too cool to eat ) , the noodles get more-or-less soft.Take a sip . It taste like hot tap water with a hint of chicken broth . On top of that it gave me heartburn . I guess THAT part is MY problem , and YMMV.I wo n't even give this junk away.Read the label : One CUP of this `` soup '' has 25 % of the daily requirement of SODIUM !	-1
The cookie part is ok , but the filling is not good at all . It is dry and splinters apart when bitten into . The taste is barely noticeable and then all of a sudden there is an odd chemical frosting taste . *sigh* I will continue searching for a gluten free cookie , but have resigned myself to the fact that I will have to cook most everything from scratch from now on . On the bright side , it will certainly make me plan ahead better and a more inventive cook .	-1
These are my least favorite of Mi-Del 's gluten-free lineup -- which is sad , because I love chocolate and caramel and had high hopes . However , these cookies are hard and dry . I 'd compare them to biscotti , but that would be unfair to biscotti because these have neither the delightfully craggy texture nor the depth of flavor that good biscotti do . The `` chocolate '' part of the equation comes not from true chocolate , but from cocoa , which makes the flavor dull and flat . The caramel flavor is not awful , but it 's marred by the hard-candy-like texture of the caramel bits . And when Mi-Del describes these as `` bite-size , '' they mean it : These cookies are approximately the size of a nickel in diameter.If I were to do it all over again , I 'd find a bag of these in a local store and try them first . As it stands now , I 'm stuck with a case of the lil ' suckers .	-1
I am a huge fan of ginger snaps . When recently diagnosed as needing to be gluten-free , and recently pregnant , I 've been on the hunt for GF ginger snaps . I 've tried three : Mi-Del Gluten Free Ginger SnapsAnnie 's Homegrown Ginger Snap Gluten Free Bunny CookiesMary 's Gone Crackers Love Cookies Gluten Free Ginger Snaps1 . Mi-DelTexture : a bit grainy . Crunchy , but crumbles in the mouth in that gluten-free grainy way that is not my favorite textureGinger flavor : middling , a tiny bit spicy on the tongue but not too muchSweetness : sweet , like you 'd expect a cookie to beSize : about 2 inches , and about 1/4 inch thickDensity : the most heavy or dense of the threeOverall 2 or 3 out of 5 stars2 . Annie'sTexture : a bit grainy , but less so than Mi-Del . Very crunchy . Little goldfish-sized crackers perfect for kids or snacking.Ginger flavor : the most mild of the three , has that gingery hint to it , but not enough where it is spicy or leaves a tingle on the tongueSweetness : mild , less sweet than Mi-Del . More like eating an animal cracker than cookie . Tastes great with a slice of cheese.Size : about 1/2 inch to 3/4 inch , and very thinDensity : lightOverall 4 out of 5 stars . If you wanted a kid-friendly cracker-like snack , this would be 5 of 5 stars3 . Mary'sTexture : VERY crunchy , not at all grainy . Texture was the least `` gluten-free '' like of the three . Felt like I was eating a regular cookie.Ginger flavor : very spicy . I could only eat two or three crackers before my tongue needed a break ( but I 'm not big on spicy foods in general so consider me on the sensitive side ) . I actually prefer a ginger cookie to be like this though . Plus , it killed my pregnancy nausea in minutes - bonus.Sweetness : not as sweet as Mi-Del , but not as mild as Annie 's . very pleasant to me.Size : about 2 inches , and about 1/4 inch thick , basically the same as Mi-Del.Density : Ultra light , most airy in the centerOverall 5 out of 5 stars.Everyone 's tastebuds are different , but these were my perceptions . I personally want a ginger cookie with a good `` bite '' to it , and I really ca n't stand gluten-free products that are grainy in texture ( which seems to be most of them ) . I want the texture to act like a regular gluten item . For me , Mary 's fit the bill exactly , and Annie 's was a close second . Annie 's was so different though , I 'd eat Mary 's as a cookie , and Annie 's as a snack , so I could see having them both in the pantry.The one I still want to try is Pamela 's , because it has great Amazon reviews . I just do n't want to buy them in bulk until I try them , so I need to find them locally .	-1
I like the fact that the Mi-Del cookies are low-fat and use some organic ingredients . I love the Mi-Del lemon and vanilla flavors , and their ginger snaps are ok -- BUT these chocolate snaps are no good . I 'm a chocolate lover , so this is rather disappointing . The taste is similar to the ginger snap , but it 's off quite a bit - slightly bitter . It 's as if they did n't put enough sugar in these snaps to counter the bitterness of cocoa powder . It also has a poor aftertaste that 's slightly bitter ( the lemon snap aftertaste is awesome keeps me wanting more ) . Got ta give it 1 star - yeah , I ate 10 of these to give them a chance , but I threw away the rest of the bag . The crunch and texture is the same as the other Mi-Del Snaps , but the flavor is off . Not Recommended .	-1
These cookies are hard & somewhatlacking in taste . We threw out half the bag.Mostly because my children did not likeginger snaps & my husband and I did not care for these .	-1
I bought these cause I 'm a chocolate snap lover , and I had been craving some . The lack of trans fats and description drew me in.Let 's just say this : I took these over to a family party , and none of the kids liked it . NOT ONE . And most of the adults , the best they could say was , 'Eh . ' I think two folks had more than one.I 'd have to say skip these cookies . They do n't make your mouth sing with chocolatey snappy joy .	-1
I ordered Ka-me rice crunch crackers , plain . I received Ka-me gluten-free rice crackers , original , all natural . Unfortunately , they have soy products in this cracker and therefore I ca n't eat it . This looks different from the picture that came with the crackers I ordered . Apparently I ca n't return the box of crackers .	-1
These were not good at all ... too spicy . Too `` limey '' ... the crunch factor was really awful ... felt like my teeth were going to break . ( Love the name ... the chips were AWFUL ! ) Wound up throwing the bag away .	-1
EDITThey have raised the price repeatedly , now it is just un-doable.These taste great . More of a restaurant style chip taste as opposed to a Frito-Lay for the masses taste.Salty enough too , unlike say Tostitos which have reduced the salt far too low . But you folks might want to revisit your packaging . You know how you grab a bag of chips at the top and pull apart the seam to open ? These seams have been sealed with titanium . And if you eventually manage to pull it apart , of course the rest of the bag is made of the same far too easily ripped all the way down the side to hope to reseal the bag , as every other manufacturer uses today .	-1
Has soy grits and flax in it , not what you expect in chips , and not adequately labeled as such when purchasing . Not the usual corn taste , although it has some health benefits . It 's just not what I expected/wanted , and wo n't buy again .	-1
Very stale , even though not out of expiration date.No non-GMO . I generally buy Garden of Eatin ' all the time ( 2 cases a month ) , but no more .	-1
I 'm just going to say it : These chips taste like detergent.Given that Garden of Eatin ' blue corn , and red hots chips are my favorite of all time , it 's puzzling how they can produce such an unfortunate product as `` Chili & Lime '' .First of all , where 's the chili ? I do n't even taste it . Even tho I 'm an advanced chili pepper user , I have a very keen palate . I detect less than 1 part per billion of chili in these here unfortunate chips.Also , I detect fraudulent lime flavors and *that* my friends is an egregious error from such a reknowned company . The red herring that it 's NOT natural is `` NATURAL FLAVORS WITH LIME '' . The translation here is that these natural flavors could be really anything , could be any combination of terpene extracts from 'natural sources ' . For example , fake lemon flavor in candies and wood detergent is often an extract from lemongrass because it 's cheaper than from lemons . But it 's a different chemical also . Fake lime is immediately a mistake , and anyone-not just supertasters-can tell.This fakeLime taste , or 'floor detergent flavor ' , is reminiscent of a childhood fragrance- the strong chemical citrus waft of mopwater that a theater employee was using to mask the rotting popcorn-soda-slurry smell by the dumpster.In other words , it seems as if Garden of Eatin found the cheapest , strongest floor stripping chemicals from Big Lots , extracted the lime scent component and littered it lightly onto these chips .	-1
i usually LOVE garden of eatin chips but these taste rancid and have soy grits in them which is not listed in the ingredients on the page ! ! buyer beware	-1
Okay it came stale in the case but where 's the cheese was my first question . Skip this product if your family enjoys cheese flavored nacho chips .	-1
I was looking forward to the great deal I got on these chips , until the box arrived . Three bags were deflated . When I looked more closely , the middle seam along the back was completely unglued , so the entire contents dumped into the box . I opened a puffy bag and over the next few days my wife and I consumed the whole bag . Our consensus ? Really stale tasting.The worst part was that the 12-pack of chips , and these are LARGE bags , expired in 25 days . Are you serious ? I complained to Amazon and got a refund . I will never try this again . I 'll pay more and buy locally one bag at a time .	-1
I am so pissed . I started eating these , and maybe had eaten3 bags , when I noticed they were all OPEN along the side seam , which had not been glued correctly . I seem to be OK , but I am not trying to get my money back . I CAN NOT RECOMMEND THESE .	-1
These were awful ! I was so disappointed , but as my title indicates , they had all the qualities a good chip should NOT have . I was especially surprised by how heavy and greasy they were : 13 grams of fat per teeny weeny bag ! ! ! DEFINITELY WOULD NOT RECOMMEND .	-1
If you are looking for a healthier alternative to a potato chip with the same taste , LOOK FURTHER ! ! These chips taste COMPLETELY different than a white potato chip . I was definitely surprised when biting into this chip -- it tastes saltless and almost bitter ! Tastes a little like fried plantain bananas -- definitely not on my top ten list of favorite snack food !	-1
These SweetPotatoes chips are okay and taste okay . You would have to aquire a taste for this kind of chip	-1
the item was ordered on august 2nd , arrived on the 11th with a best by date of august 30th ! ! i had ordered to stock up on a healthy snack but instead got a case of chips that are already stale , and tasteless . amazon made it right but i am disappointed to receive old product . I imagine these would taste great if they were fresh ! !	-1
Normally I love these , but the last batch I got tasted like they had been burned . Yuck ! I do n't know if it was just that batch or what , but I do n't think I will be buying these again .	-1
Great taste . But why do they insist on saving money using safflower oil instead of canola oil . They say may contain 'canola or safflower or ... etc ' . But they always contain the cheap oils that I 'm allergic to . I 'd be a frequent flyer on these chips if they 'd just do them so I wo n't get sick .	-1
I do not like the chips ! They are not to my liking and I do not think I will order them again even though I like sweet potato !	-1
I thought I 'd really found a great treat to eat , but all the bags in the case contained a lot of finely broken pieces , and the product is very greasy . Would not buy this again .	-1
We keep trying different variety of chips in our office to avoid getting bored and also find better chips . The crew in the office did not like these at all , we have been getting the PopChips and the Kettle chips which tend to disappear pretty fast.Will not order again .	-1
If you like eating salted wood you may enjoy these chips . Yellow , thicker than normal chips . There may be people or beavers out there that enjoy this type of wood snack but sadly I can only give them two stars for the nice bag they come in . Would love to send them back but I will feed them to neighborhood squirrels instead . Terra Gold needs to revamp their recipe ! Just sayin ...	-1
I imagine that many people like this product , but I do not . It tastes & # 34 ; earthy & # 34 ; to me . I had liked veggie chips purchased at a health food store , so took the risk here that I would like these . I lost my $ 22.00 gamble by buying a case of 24 . Hope I can find someone who does like them .	-1
Do n't make the same mistake I did by buying a dozen of these . I bought a ton of food here on Amazon and most of it went in the trash . My daughter is n't that fussy but this was gross . It was so runny for stage 2 food . I bought several cases of food and this and the chicken with sweet potatoes were like pure water thin . Also check the ingredients.IngredientsWater , Organic Apples , Organic Carrots , Organic Turkey , Organic Whole Barley Flour.Apple is in almost every earth 's best item .	-1
We used to LOVE these graham sticks . I just started up our Subscribe & Save order again and could barely get through one graham stick before they went in the trash . The recipe has totally changed and they tasted stale on top of that . So frustrating ... why mess with a good thing Earth 's Best ? ?	-1
I really did n't notice Elmo on the package ? These are for kids more than adults . Nothing wrong with flavor , but priced for kids that scream alot .	-1
These are not very good : poor flavor and texture . The filling has a pasty taste and little apple flavor.I will be sticking with Kellogg 's nutri-grain .	-1
They have modified the recipe . My kids do n't like them any more . Just as well , since who really needs more cookies in their life ?	-1
I was looking for something healthier to replace Cheez-Its & Goldfish for my toddler . These were gross . He hated them & so did 3 other toddlers who tried them .	-1
My son liked the taste and has a nice thick texture . But he was sooooo gassy after eating this there is no way I can feed him the rest that I bought .	-1
http : //www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000ER3EFC/ref=cm_cr_rev_prod_imgI do n't have a baby , but I am on soft foods for a while after stomach surgery . I ordered some baby foods from Amazon and promptly found out why my babies never would eat baby food . This is supposedly sweet potatoes , but they found a way to remove all the earthy goodness . Before I added salt it tasted like nothing eaten by a human ; with salt , it tasted like very mild carrots . I suppose I will eventually use it in baking , but frankly , if it 's sweet potatoes I never want to meet the strain of sweet potatoes it came from .	-1
My issue with this product is that not all the jars have the same texture and consistency , what makes me wonder , some are fresh , and some are not ... some jars had the spinach smooth , some other jars had it dry and `` stiff '' . I want to make sure that what I give to my baby is good and fresh . This product did not convinced me 100 % . I have to say I am happy with the squash , peas , among others .	-1
This tea was a real disappointment . I really disliked the taste . I tried it hot and iced ... .yuck ! I got little or no black currant flavor and in general am not happy with the Ahmad tea line .	-1
This tastes pretty much like your plain old Liptons tea . I LOVE cassis ( black currant ) flavor and was so looking forward to the tea . I buy a blackcurrant tea in Europe that actually tastes like cassis , so I know it is possible.It is drinkable , but nothing special . Look elsewhere if you want blackcurrant flavor .	-1
i honest do n't get how people can drink this stuff . i read an offical review about how bitter this stuff was and i had to agree . caffeine hits ok , but nothing special . compared with folgers instant when it was good , its no contest . 4tsp of folgers instant used to do it , really powerful stuff . this is not powerful stuff .	-1
I 'm really not a picky coffee drinker . I have no problem drinking coffee from a gas station ... however , this coffee I can not drink . It has such a bitter and weird taste to me - almost like it 's very burnt coffee . And it must be very acidic because it gave me slight heartburn after drinking it , which I normally do not experience drinking coffee . I LOVE Starbucks VIA but was really hoping for an organic alternative . Maybe you will like this -- but to me it 's awful ! ! ! !	-1
When so many reviews are over-the-top about vanilla beans ... does n't it make you question the integrity of the reviews ? To be frank , they are all from one source : JR Mushrooms and Specialties.If you buy from this company , you 'll receive a pile of mediocre or rancid beans . And technically , you ca n't return them , though if you contact Amazon they might let you.One . HUGE . Scam.Stay away from these rancid `` vanilla beans '' , DO NOT LISTEN TO THE FAKE REVIEWS , find quality elsewhere .	-1
`` May contain trace amounts of tree nuts , dairy and wheat . '' I was ready to order until I saw this info . Not good for a Celiac/Gluten-intolerant person with additional dairy allergy ! How can products get away with saying they are gluten-free & then post a little warning that the food may contain wheat ? ? ? ! ! ! : (	-1
At first I was happy to find this product in the store , since I am on a gluten free and no white rice diet . The lable on the package says brown rice . Thank you Amazon for noting the `` brown rice '' is actually a combination of white rice and rice bran . It is amazing the amount of flexibility in labeling standards .	-1
Nothing as I remember Dutch licorice ... not salty taste , just ammonium chloride , nor salt crystals on licorice . Certainly wish I 'd just ordered just one container ! Not wonderful licorice taste w/tang , just chemical residue in mouth . This product ought to be offered by the container so folks are n't stuck with five unopened packages .	-1
The fourth ingredient in this candy is ammonium chloride . Too bad I did n't read the label before ingesting this product . It has been several hours since I ate my first and LAST two pieces of this candy and I still have the sensation and smell of ammonia in my nose . A spicy dinner and a Neti Pot nasal wash did not remove it.This is one of the worst things I have ever had in my mouth ( or up my nose ... ) and I am heartily glad I bought a single carton at a local store before buying a CRATE at amazon.com.I 'm a salty licorice lover . This licorice is very salty , hardly sweet ( that 's what I expected ) but packs an unpleasant and lasting ammonia wallop that I found intolerable .	-1
I prefer soft licorice . I do NOT prefer salt licorice . At least not licorice this salty . And I agree there seems to be this note of bleach in the bouquet ( if licorice can be said to have a bouquet ) . Give me the sweet stuff anytime ! This stuff ? Not so much .	-1
If you like soft sweet chewable licorice candy , do n't buy this brand . It is very hard to chew and lacks the traditional licorice flavor . This was a waste of money .	-1
I am a great lover of licorice . And I do n't know what this stuff is , but it ai n't licorice . It has a strong ammonia taste , and reminds me more of droppings in a cat 's litter box than any sort of candy . I 've been told this is just a 'different ' sort of licorice , and it 's meant to be slightly salty , instead of sweet . But I 'm not confusing ammonia with salt . This definitely has a urine odor , and since I 've never tasted cat urine , I can only guess this is what it would taste like . Do n't waste your money . This might make you ill .	-1
I am a black licorice lover -- no matter what kind it is . This licorice is dead and flat . Do n't blame it on being & # 34 ; sugar free & # 34 ; because I ordered some other hard candy sugar-free licorice and it was very good . Liking this licorice would be an acquired taste . This is my opinion , but I 'd think twice before making was is a considerable investment in this candy . Oh , and also , it is not a very good consistency . It 's not soft , like I thought it would be , but not hard either . It reminds me of something that got dried out , although I 'm sure that 's just the way the candy is .	-1
These just arrived in the mail . I was looking for a treat , instead I got salty black coins , the package says no sodium but something in there tasted so salty I ca n't eat them . I do not recommend that you buy these unless you have had them before and know what to expect .	-1
I love Sesame seeds and Whole Grain Rye . This is however all Wheat flour and tastes like white bread . It is also a smaller 7 oz instead of 9.8 oz.Less of an inferior product . Notice it is manufactured in Germany and not Sweden .	-1
I 'd rather give up chocolate than eat this stuff ... .healthy or not ... .Endangered Species Black Panther , Extreme Dark Chocolate ( 88 % ) , 3-Ounce Bars ( Pack of 12 ) ... .Just way too bitter ! ~ Just not for me ! ~	-1
I bought this expecting to be able to enjoy the savory flavor of man 's closest living genetic relative , the chimpanzee . When I tasted this chocolate bar , all I could taste is dark chocolate . Now , had this been marketed as just a dark chocolate bar , then I would have given it a four or five star rating , as JUST chocolate it 's fine and quite tasty . But look at the label , there is quite clearly a chipmanzee on the label . Where is the chimp flavor ? Had I wanted just chocolate flavor I would have bought such . Please stop such false advertising and put at least extract from the flesh of a chimpanzee into this chocolate bar .	-1
The bags came taped together in a huge box with no protection other than the tape . Most of the chips , so far , are very broken . They were sent with two heavier items ; the box and tape on the box itself were torn and a mess . It 's the first time I 'm truly disappointed with Amazons policy of cramming everything in as few boxes as possible . It was extremely hard to handle , and harmed the product .	-1
Ever eaten grit ? Not 'grits ' but road grit ? I have tasted it , unfortunately , and this stuff reminded me of my awful experience . The flavor does not offend , but is nothing to get excited about either . Not recommended .	-1
If you or a family member has a sesame allergy , be forewarned . Even though the Amazon listing does not mention any sesame cross-contamination possibility , the packaging DOES say that this product is made on equipment that is also used to manufacture products made with sesame . This kind of inconsistency between online listings and food packaging is really disappointing , and it presents a real health safety risk . Of course , if you are allergic to foods , you should always be double checking packages . However , when 12 packages of crackers show up with an unexpected allergen mentioned on the label , the timing is n't the best.If not for the allergen declaration concern , I would be rating these crackers 4-5 stars . They taste great , though not as & # 34 ; sour & # 34 ; of a sourdough as , for instance , traditional San Francisco sourdough bread . They have just a hint of sour to them .	-1
I do like the taste of this soup and enjoy the somewhat spicy `` kick . '' And the price is not bad . But the contents of the soup do not fully `` cook '' when prepared as instructed . Even after letting the soup sit tightly covered for 10 minutes , I still find that the vegetable pieces are somewhat hard . I am going to try emptying the soup container contents into a bowl after the `` cook '' period and microwave it and see if this corrects the issue . But this will make preparation more complicated at work ( I bought this product to keep at work ) .	-1
I wanted these because they benefit rain forests . But they taste really strange compared with other brands like Lindt or Hershey 's . Look up the ingredients and you 'll see that they 're made of chocolate liquor rather than cocoa solids , or something like that . I could n't eat any of it !	-1
This is the third product by this company I have tried . First was the one with the chimpanzee on the label . Fine chocolate , but alas no chimpanzee flavor . Then the one with a bat on the label . Can you guess the outcome ? Again , the chocolate itself was good , but no flavor of bat ! So fine , I figured since trees are stationary and not moving like chimps and bats , maybe third time is a charm . Perhaps there is some sort of exotic Brazilian wood flavor in this chocolate . So , I bite into it..and what do I taste ? Chocolate and mint ! Now who knows , maybe the mint leaves was lugged about by some native in the rainforest . But really now , a forest is the trees ! Even if the mint was grown in the Amazon , that 's not what I expect at all ! I want this chocolate bar to taste like honest to god wood ! Well , I was fooled again . Chimpanzee chocolate bar , no chimp flavor . Bat chocolate bar , no bat flavor . Rainforest chocolate bar , no tree flavor . So again I am forced to give an otherwise quality product one star . It 's a shame , if they would stop their false advertising and just advertise this as a mint chocolate bar , I 'd give it four or even five stars . I 'm not normally a fan of mint but I did like this chocolate bar . Or would have if it had tasted like a tree !	-1
The most over-rated chocolate bars on Amazon . Could barely taste the mint . Only with my eyes closed , in a dark room and with the TV off and then it was a struggle . I have had German chocolate ( Ritter ) 3 years past its expiration date and run over by a car that were better than these . At three bucks a bar it is a sin .	-1
280 mgs . of salt is too much for a `` health '' bar . I love most Kashi products , but this one left a salty taste that lingered all day . If you salt your food you probably will not notice the salty taste . I have always used salt sparingly mostly because I like to taste my food not cover it up with another flavor . So judge for yourself , but health food should have to follow certain guidelines .	-1
I really have no idea how this product has so many positive reviews . It tastes like cardboard . I 've tried fruit , nuts , poppyseeds and even chocolate . Nothing makes these taste better . I 've very thankful that I got these on the clearnace rack at the grocery store ( although now I know why they were on clearance ! )	-1
I am gluten intolerant for 16 years and have had the other ones which are good somewhat but these are much less tasty , so I give them away to kids and they do n't come back for more ! ! !	-1
I have tried several recipes with this mix and none of them turn out well . They taste good but everything turns to crumbles . Very dissapointed .	-1
I bought this bread mix due the high rated reviews . The mix made a beautiful loaf , but the flavor was n't the greatest . The only way I was able to eat it , was to pile it with peanut butter and jelly . As stated by one of the reviews it also contains milk , I 'm lactose intolerant . I will give Pamela 's a try .	-1
What happened to the 22 oz size ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ! The recipe is different1 And the TASTE ! ! ! ! ! It was the best gluten free or not bread we had ever had ! Now its ok . I wo n't eat it , but my husband will . I WANT THE OLD RECIPE BACK ! The buckwheat in this sucks ! The smell is off and it has a dryer texture . I have tried cream instead of milk to try and make it more moist and it did help but I still ca n't get past the taste ! ! ! PLEASE BRING BACK THE OLD RECIPE ! ! ! ! ! !	-1
Glutino purchased Gluten Free Pantry and changed the ingredients and directions without having the Amazon website updated . You can no longer make Irish Soda Bread and it contains things like sorghum flour , buckwheat flour , millet flour , pea protein , etc . I guess check the Glutino website before purchasing on Amazon to know what you will be getting.OUTDATED REVIEW : This mix makes my favorite Irish Soda Bread . The recipe is right on the box . Add egg , milk , butter or oil , raisins , caraway seed , and orange rind for a great tasting yeast-free potato-free bread !	-1
I can no longer make the best , greatest tasting GF Irish Soda Bread with this mix ! I wrote a rave review in 2009 , when this was the Gluten Free Pantry 's Brown Rice Waffle & Pancake Mix . Glutino purchased the company and totally RUINED this mix ! ! ! What a huge disappointment . The soda bread recipe was not on the label , but I found it on the Glutino website . Before baking the mix tasted the same but I noticed it was a little more difficult to spread into the pan . And then we cut into the final product . Grainy texture , kept falling apart , crumbly -- a total disappointment . I 'll have to look for a different mix or recipe . Bummer .	-1
I did not have butter , so I used canola oil , but knowing that butter contains water and solids , I reduced the amount of oil ( scant ) . I also used 2 egg replacers . The dough was very globular thick , like cookie dough almost , instead of a brownie batter . So I added 2 Tb water and then the batter looked good . During baking , the brownies were bubbling . So much oil that the brownies were like being fried . ( Even if using butter , 7 Tb seems like a lot ) .I cooked these longer than what the package states and they were still not good . The texture was like a dense gummy doughy oily mess . I had to throw out the whole thing . I know that it states to use butter and egg , but I 've made many other gluten free brownie mixes with alternatives and they 've turned out well.In addition , my friend and I thought that the packaging instructions were poor . It mentioned something like choose other ingredient alternatives , but it did not suggest any other specifics.The flavor was a little blah . Also sugar is the first ingredient and then chocolate chips . So I thought these had a lot of sugar per serving ( 23 grams ) .	-1
I bought the six pack case and after baking the first two boxes I am confident that I wo n't be purchasing this again . If you are looking for chocolate decadence , you wo n't find it here . The next box I will try with regular oil not melted butter/margarine as directed . Maybe then I 'll get that chewy , gooey richness that this products claims . There is a strange aftertaste , not one that I wish to linger . Betty Crocker G/F brownie mix is by far a better tasting brownie and less expensive . My vote is G/F with Betty C !	-1
Oh , my , how awful this was . Beth Hilson should be spinning in Bette Hagman 's grave.I am a highly experienced baker . I 'm not new to GF baking , but I am new to GF pie crust ( I 've avoided it and pie for years ) .The package is too small , especially for the money . The product as packaged should be increased at least 25 % by weight . As it is , it barely makes the prescribed-size 8 '' pies . And good luck finding an 8 '' pie pan in a retail store ( Amazon has them ) . There is no reason Gluten Free Pantry can not market products that are sized to fit standard-sized U.S. pans ( 9 '' or 10 '' ) . This is just cheapness on their part.The instructions should be written so as to be as foolproof as possible . Making a GF crust is not the same thing as regular pie crust . It will not look or feel the same . For instance , when cutting in the 2nd 10 oz of shortening , the flour turned to a solid , waxy mass , nothing like regular pie crust . This was before any liquid was added . All ingredients were chilled . This made it difficult to mix in the liquid ingredients . No guided descriptions or instructions are offered.Moreover , the instructions say `` 3 tsp vinegar , '' `` 2 Tbsp water '' and 2 eggs . 3 tsp is a tablespoon . Eggs vary in size , and instructions should be given regarding the total amount of eggs and water so as to be exact . My eggs were extra large , so I reduced the amount of water . Nevertheless , the dough was still far too wet , so I held off on adding all the eggs + water + vinegar . You could add some AP GF flour or starch if things get too wet.20 oz of fat is a lot of fat for a crust this size , and you have to add so many other ingredients it sort of begs the question why one purchased a `` mix '' at all , since it requires so much augmentation to be prepared properly.Even after 90 minutes of chilling , the dough was very soft . It did roll out between sheets of plastic wrap , and transferred to the pan with some tearing that was easy to patch . However , I found this a tedious and moderately difficult task , and I am a very experienced cook and baker . There was almost no extra crust - maybe 2 oz , or a ball the size of a walnut - left over . I had to struggle to roll the crust in the exact size and shape to fit my pan.My unattractive result looks nothing like the crust on the box , neither in thickness , nor in texture . It is too thin on the pie , and it collapsed unattractively and did not set in the oven . Also , the crust browned on the edges of my tin pie pans too quickly ( because the edges are too thin because there is n't enough crust ) , with only 30 mins of baking at 350 deg . Usually vinegar retards browning in crust . Even covered with foil , the edges burned and wo n't be eaten.A subsequent insult is that somehow the top crust on my berry pie partially dissolved into the filling before it set in the oven . Then I poked the top crust with my finger and it has turned into this loose , sandy mass - ghastly.I forgot to update after I tasted it , but no surprises here . The crust 's main texture is gritty/sandy . Despite the added eggs , the crust fell apart like a sand sculpture in the rain . The flavor was of rice with that classic GF metallic aftertaste . Truly an abominable product that should be shunned and its manufacturers sent angry letters .	-1
I bought this mix ages ago and have yet to use it because it requires so many additional ingredients . You even have to add baking powder and sugar ! And , it requires 20 Tbs . of fat , too : 10 of vegetable shortening and 10 of butter . This might add the flaky factor , but , it is horrendously unhealthy ! Basically , it is an expensive box of flour . I have found several `` from scratch '' recipes that use less ingredients ! For instance , Nicole Hunn 's `` Gluten-Free on a Shoestring '' cookbook ( excellent BTW ) contains a Savory Pie Crust and a Sweet Pie Crust recipe and both make two 9-inch crusts and only use 10 Tablespoons of butter and less ingredients than you have to add to this mix ! Although I generally like Glutino mixes , this one is a rip-off , plain and simple ... well , simple is n't the word to use for this one ! Do n't waste your money or pantry space on this mix !	-1
I 'm not thrilled with the recipe for making this crust -- I think of a `` mix '' as something I need to add only a few ingredients to , but this requires as many extra ingredients as making crust from scratch , and demands a lot of fat . I could have done that using gf flour and saved myself a lot of money .	-1
I have tried a few brands of gluten free flour and thought I would try this based on the review ratings and price , but the texture is gritty in my baked goods and it does n't convert to flour like it should , making everything I make dry and many times inedible . I will not purchase this again and may toss the remaining flour I have .	-1
nature path is than Baby loves ! We love it as a sub for morning cereal . It is simple as can be ! No sugar added ! organicI still have to research about the puff process ... but so far we love the product and also their rice , kamut and millet puffs ! I put millet puffs on anything and baby will it it : ) )	-1
caused horrable wheezing had to rush my son to the dr. twice . He can only have organic snacks ... this isnt totally organic after all ... caused supset stomack as well	-1
I bought the Black Beans & Minestrone Soup cups for the auto-repair shop I work at . There 's 22 guys & the ones who tried the two flavors I bought - did n't get it again . I 'm a huge Black Beans & Rice fan but this brand was a bust.I found the beans and/or pasta bits stayed hard and the flavor was thin and dull . Huge disappointment & tough to get rid of the last few cups ( except to the unsuspecting ) .	-1
I just got this and the similar product from Dr. McDougall 's which has the salt and spices in a separate 'flavor packet ' but otherwise is somewhat similar . I do not like the fact that this product has all the salt ( a lot of it ) and spices mixed into the dry ingredients so you have no way to avoid it . I would give this 3 stars if it did not have all the salt pre-mixed into it . They should follow the example of the other company and keep the salt package separate . If you are looking for a low salt diet , this is not any good at all .	-1
Great product but they keep rising the price , making it more expensive than buying local . Oct 2010 the price was 11.96 for 12 with subscription . Oct 2011 , the price is 14.42 . Individual price has increased from .99 to $ 1.20 in one year .	-1
Do n't waste your money.Not so much beans.Mainly a cup of broth . No substance , just wan na be.Just pass .	-1
Well , I 've trying different licorices from various websites , and kept running into this one . Based on the FOUR 5-star reviews already listed here , I was excited to try it . However , if `` into every life a little rain must fall '' , then `` bad candy is like a storm . `` There is n't much licorice taste to these at all ( a friend and I thought they had a hint of chocolate ? ) While they are n't sticky , they are kind of mushy and bland . A way better choice for a good licorice experience is `` Gustafs Platinum Select-Sweet '' - THOSE you ca n't eat just one .	-1
Haribo candy from Amazon is always good but these are not anything like what I 'd call real licorice and have hardly any licorice flavor . This is just soft , black candy.If you want REAL licorice , fresh and with real ingredients , not `` carnuba wax '' and `` beeswax '' and `` modified food starch '' ... bleh ! Get TUBIS licorice.Tubi 's Organic Soft Licorice , 3.5-Ounces ( Pack of 12 ) or Panda licoricePanda All Natural Soft Licorice Chews , 7-Ounce Boxes ( Pack of 12 ) . THAT is what REAL licorice is supposed to taste like.It helps that those 2 licorice brands are the only ones that do n't hurt my stomach . Must be that carnuba wax that was killin ' me..ew ...	-1
These are ok . The best way to describe the taste is that they taste like pepsi cola that 's gone flat . They 're not terrible but they also are n't that great .	-1
These are ok . The best way to describe the taste is that they taste exactly like pepsi cola that 's gone flat . They 're not terrible but they also are n't that great .	-1
I love Haribo Gold Bears and the Rolls of the disks , but the consistency of the Haribo Gummi Pink Grapefruit is very strange . It is similar to the sugared sliced fruit , but with hard pieces throughout . Some people love the sliced fruit candies , my husband does , but not me . Hopefully my husband will like these otherwise they will go to waste .	-1
We have enjoyed the smaller green candy Frogs in the past but these were not nearly as good . These are large and not what I was expecting . They are not the tasty treat of the past and these were made in different country . We found them not only different but with a rather unpleasant taste .	-1
I disagree with the other Haribo fans on this product page . These frogs are not particularly tasty . The reason ? The white stuff at the bottom of each `` frog '' . No idea what it 's called , but it does n't taste good . Frankly , it tastes like frog ! Only two stars for you this time , Mr. Haribo.Otherwise , this product line is excellent . What do you think I consume when I 'm writing these meaningless and cheap Amazon reviews ? ; - ) Forget about these barely edible frogs , and go for the gummi bears , Schnuller or Tropi-Frutti instead !	-1
I 'm a big fan of many gummi candies -- especially the Jelly Belly version of this product , but it can be expensive and harder to find . I thought I would give this brand a try -- BUT WHAT A MISTAKE ! ! ! The candy is giant , the `` seeds '' are waxy balls , and the gel inside has no flavor at all . The red ones especially have a chemical taste . Amazon issued a refund and I 'm throwing these away . Save your $ $ $ for the real thing !	-1
Disappointing . Fair to good raspberry flavor with gummi chewy core , but the tiny pure sugar pellets coating ( to mimic raspberry form ) is sickening sweet . Ca n't imagine who would enjoy the product.Would not buy again . Need to stick with the original slightly tart and chewy Gummi Bears .	-1
I did n't like them at all . WAY TOO SWEET ! They 're not as gummy and chewy as you 'd expect from Haribo . I did n't taste a whole lot of raspberry flavor either ; maybe I 'd had better ones . Originally , I thought there were the same gummies I received at Christmas from a friend who 's living in Europe ; but boy , was I disappointed . My husband and kids did n't like them ; my husband then brought the candies to work - they were n't a hit either . I tried to give the candies away and nobody wanted them . I read the other reviews before I bought these and except for 1 review , all the other customers seemed to love these . Well , good for you if you love them ; we definitely do n't enjoy them at all .	-1
i do n't really like it , i thought it 'd be chewier . i have a roommate who likes it very much however .	-1
I purchased *five pounds* of raspberries and blackberries because I 've had Haribo gummi bears before and really enjoyed them , plus the price ca n't be beat ( usually just five ounces is two to three dollars , imagine getting five whole pounds for fifteen dollars ! ) .I DID NOT ENJOY these . Buy the gold gummi bears instead.These raspberries blackberries are too sweet and have a weird consistency.They are nothing like the Jelly Belly raspberries blackberries ( which are lovely little drops of heaven ) .I was very uncertain buying raspberries blackberries online , because I was n't sure if I would get cruddy old stale raspberries blackberries that endanger your teeth and taste of old wax.That was not the case with me.These raspberries blackberries seem fresh , and were well packaged and delivered promptly.I purchased the raspberries blackberries on Jan 27 2009 . I received them on Jan 30 2009 . They were fresh and squishy , and well packaged . They shipped from Indianapolis and arrived in DC three days later . Terrific.Too bad you have to buy two bags to get free shipping , now I have 10 pounds of candy lying around ! Five pounds of which I really hate.I would not recommend this product . Go for the Haribo standard bearer , the gold gummi bear instead .	-1
I purchased the cases of this cereal because it is organic , it fills me up , and due to the nose dive recognized within the U.S. economy over the past four years , I am no longer able to afford much.Unfortunately , the last three cases I have ordered via Amazon have been stale . I contemplated leaving this feedback because I am just thankful to have anything to eat . However , after three cases of stale cereal that leaves an after taste due to the stale quality , I am having a difficult time stomaching this cereal anymore.For a couple more dollars , which I really did not wish to spend , but I am going to try to do so now , I have found that Nature 's Path Kamut Puffs are `` by far '' extremely fresh in comparison . It may be the Eco-bag that Nature 's Path packages their cereal in , verses the softer plastic that Arrowhead packages their cereal in . Not sure.Update : 6/23/13 I have now purchased at least a dozen more cases ( with 12 bags of cereal in each ) and every single bag is always stale . I wish I did not have to buy them , but I guess I am just lucky that they are available at all .	-1
These are VERY sweet and crumble a lot . My son likes them but I definitely would n't buy them again , I do LOVE the cinnamon danish by this company . Not as sweet and super cinnamon flavor !	-1
That Hain Celestial company that is manufacturing Health Valley and other brands has gone crazy of late , balancing purity with excess calories and lack of nutritional value . If you know anything at all about nutrition , and you review Hains other products , you will see the consistency . Hains canned products in fact all come in cans that develop metal whiskers that can break off into the sauce . I think Hains should be banned , and all its subsidiary products along with it , like Health Valley , for customer fraud and endangerment .	-1
This goes to show how different everybody 's taste is . I love licorice and decided to try this since Amazon happened to be out of stock of Good & Plenty , which is my all-time favorite . I literally gagged when I put one of these in my mouth and started chewing . TERRIBLE . It tastes like a weird wad of chemicals . I do n't see how anybody can even swallow it let alone rave about how good it is.. Extremely disappointed and have crossed this one off my list forever . It 's going straight into the trash since I would n't even give it to a food shelter . I did n't think it was that risky a purchase since Haribo has such a good reputation but I 've got 5 Lbs . of inedible junk on my hands now .	-1
Im a big licorice fan - especially soft and chewy . This Haribo is a great price so i tried it . It was very fresh and chewy but really has no flavor outside of a slightly chemical taste .	-1
I took a chance on ordering the licorice allsorts from Amazon assuming that because they had just started selling this item last week I would have a good chance of getting a bag of fresh candy . WRONG ! This stuff tastes like it has been on someone 's shelf for a couple of years and while it is not rock hard yet , it is pretty darn close.I am very disappointed.Update July 13 , 2006 : A friend of mine ordered some of the Allsorts from Amazon ( against my advice ) and - big surprise - their order was also stale . It is really too bad because if these allsorts were fresh they would be the best tasting I have ever had . I hope Amazon can get it together and get a fresh batch of these candies because then they would be worthy of a 5 star rating .	-1
If you enjoy Licorice Allsorts , this product is not for you . Although manufactured in England , the candy is a very poor product when compared to the original Bassett 's Licorice Allsorts , also manufactured in England . I believethat the Bassett Company is the original creator of Licorice Allsorts some hundred or so years ago , and it remains the very best . I am a one-time buyer of Haribo 's product and would not buy it again .	-1
I would not give these to my grand kids . These were so dry and stale that all I did was throw them out . Rocks might have been better then these .	-1
The bag I got seemed to be mostly lemon and lime gummy bears . The flavor was not as good as I had expected . Should be fine for kids , my grandkids like them OK but as an adult I was disappointed . But even the kids said they were just OK . I decided not to order them again.UPDATE : MY grandkids ask me to order some of these for them ( I personally did n't care for them but for them I was willing to buy more . ) Anyway , when I say how much they NOW COST , I said no way I will check around online . I got these for $ 10.74 the first time , they are now $ 18.30 , yes I said $ 18.30 . There is no way , I will pay that much for these , it is just not worth it.I am just shocked at the price jump of things on Amazon . It just seems excessive .	-1
My tongue hurts . Just ate my first Haribo gummy bears and now my tongue hurts and has several raised sores on the end of it . Shocked , I read the packaging and noticed that they have artificial flavors and colors . Yuck . If I 'd known that , I would not have purchased them . I see now that this information is on the Amazon website , but I guess I was swept away by all the good reviews and did n't read it carefully enough . Ouch .	-1
I do n't know if I got a bad bag or what from the good reviews I have read but these were the toughest gummi bears I have ever had . They were hard to chew to the point where your mouth would begin to hurt . I still have about four pounds remaining after a couple months now since they are n't enjoyable to eat . The taste is n't the greatest either unless you let them set in you mouth for a while but the toughness just makes them very unenjoyable . Maybe its just a bad bag but I have no reason to say these are good if they were n't and that is my experience so far .	-1
[ Good ] Tasted great : Not too sweet . Just sweet enough.Smells greatGood texture and feel : Semi rubbery and not as soft as normal gummy candy.It is a huge heavy bag of good tasting stuff . It 's Haribo ( I think ) , so taste wise nothing is a surprise.Really Cheap : Five ounce Haribo gummy bags in stores , at a fraction of the size , cost about half as much . I suspect there 's a reason for this . [ Bad ] For some odd reason there is no nutritional label on this product . I do n't even recall seeing an ingredients list . Is n't this illegal for the US ? This made me a little uneasy about this bag . Normal Haribo gummy bags have a nutritional label.Gas : I 'm not sure why but eating this gummy gives me really horrible gas . I 've never experienced this problem with gummy candies or even other Haribo gummies in smaller bags ( with Nutritional labels ) . I ca n't help but feel that there 's something wrong with these candies . [ Misc ] Haribo is a German company and most Haribo gummy bags are from Germany . Interestingly this barely labeled five pound mystery bag is from Turkey . [ Verdict ] I would buy the normal Haribo gummy bags . There 's something wrong with these batches . It does n't help that it does n't look anything like the normal Haribo bags with the cartoon bear . Do n't buy this mystery bag .	-1
With all the rave reviews , I was really excited about these gummy bears . The flavor is good , but the texture is what really turns me on to gummy candy . Unfortunately these were too chewy for me and they did n't go over well with my friends either . I guess it 's all about personal preference . I 'll look elsewhere for my candy .	-1
These are coated in sugar which make them less gummy and kind of dry . They are very firm and chewy more than gummy . They have a lot of citric acid which makes them tart but there is no discernible fruit flavor in any of them . If you ate each kind with your eyes closed , you would not be able to tell one `` fruit '' from the other . Very very disappointed . Will be giving 11 bags away and not ordering any Haribo again .	-1
The nutrition information is entirely inaccurate . I ordered these based on the nutrition information ; Amazon did refund my money and I gave the bars to my local food bank . I hear they were very good in taste , but with a restricted diet , there was no way I could chance trying them . They did arrive on time and were packaged well , however .	-1

When I made this soup it turned into watery potato flake gruel . Other soups translate into a cup o soup with more delicious results .	-1
I enjoyed the classic-tasting split pea soup by Nile Spice , so was looking forward to their potato leek . Though I read the reviews and there was some mention of it being subpar ( to put it nicely ) , I hoped that my tastebuds would find this good enough in times of laziness or hurry . I 'm adventurous and quite the opposite of picky when it comes to foods so I thought , `` how bad could this really be ? '' Well , I 'll just say this : If you 're looking forward to this tasting like the traditional style creamy colored potato leek soup , look elsewhere.I debated whether to give this ONE star because I know I wo n't ever get this again , but in all fairness , it IS edible ... And if I had n't been looking forward to this tasting even remotely like the EATING RIGHT brand 's potato leek soup cup , I might have given this three stars . Then again , this also had a slightly stale or processy taste , unlike other soup cups . Maybe this was a bad batch ? Who knows.-UPDATE-By the third cup in the batch , I was thoroughly sick of these . The taste of this soup cup became almost disgusting . I could n't eat these anymore and neither could anyone else in my household . Two starts to ONE .	-1
Nile Spice makes several good soups - this just does n't happen to be my favorite . Kind of like watery mashed potato flakes - have tried adding ham to make it more interesting but bottom line it just did n't catch my fancy .	-1
The flavors in this soup are overpowered by the outrageously high sodium content . This is not a meal ; by far it is not a meal . This is a snack , and a snack need not pack 24 % of your daily sodium intake .	-1
This soup tastes great and the price is not bad . But the contents of the soup do not fully `` cook '' when prepared as instructed ( I have the same issue with a different Nile Spice soup ) . Even after letting the soup sit tightly covered for 10 minutes , about a third of the beans and 2/3 of the rice are still mostly hard ( watch your teeth ) . I wo n't be ordering any Nile Spice soups in the future .	-1
Here is what I think about the taste , it 's really bad . I did follow the instructions , it 's not something you will enjoy eating specially if you like eating beans . Here is the problem making it the beans become really soft while the rice are still hard , and the soup takes on a weak style bean soup . I did n't like it at all .	-1
I tried three of the Nile quick soup cups - corn , potato , and red beans & rice . This one was my least favorite . I absolutely disagree with reviewers who call it spicy . I do n't get a hint of hot from it , but there is definitely an over-seasoned thing going on . The beans always seem to stay hard , even letting it sit for double the time , and the overall texture is sort of thick like a chili , but also kind of watery . I just do n't care for this at all .	-1
This soup lacks flavor and takes forever for the beans and rice to soften up , so it tasted crunchy . Just not a good selection .	-1
Too squeamy for me ... ... ..Haribo always has a tasty product ; but I ca n't get my eyes off the squigglies . We eat with our eyes , you know . Kids would love them .	-1
OMG my booty still hurts and it 's been 9 hours ! ! If you want to lose weight and spend the next 24 hours on the toilet be my guest and eat these demon bears they call candy . I only ate about 12 and after about 10 minutes my stomach started gargling and the next thing I know I was banging on the bathroom door for mercy . My wife was taking a shower but I did n't care I broke down the door and took the dumb of my life ! ! She got so mad and disgusted but I was in a state of pure pain . I was glued to that toilet for roughly 20 minutes letting out everything I ate for the last two years . That night I went every 15 minutes with my cheeks flapping wildly in the night . The next day I felt exhausted and did n't bother going to work . I did n't finish the rest and decide to burn them and send them back to hell where they came from . I would only recommend these if you want to have the worst night of your life and if you want to lose some major pounds .	-1
I fell in love with these a while back . I am diabetic and try to control my blood sugar and weight with sugar free and low carb foods . I have been through several bags of these . I trusted the label that the manufacture placed on this item . ( completely my fault ) While I do not wish to call them `` liars '' , I can think of no other term . They are COMPLETELY MISLEADING THE CONSUMER ! ! ! I eat virtually NO carbs , I would have a few hand fulls of these at night . I awoke with night sweats and was not only not loosing weight , I was gaining . My blood sugar was spiking insanely high ! ! ! ! The intestinal distress that other reviewers have had , did not afflict me . I am use to `` sugar-free '' candy . It is usually sweetened with Maltitol , sugar-alcohol and a few others . Point is , I am use to it . But I knew there was a serious problem and I began to re-examine everything I was eating.When I re-ordered it this time , I began reading the label . I must say I am a bit perplexed . There is NO listing of ingredients on the packaging and I could not find it here either . The nutritional label , both here and on the package states that this product has 37 grams of total carbohydrates per serving ( 17 pieces ) . There is nothing listed under the carbohydrate section . So , NOTHING offsets the net carbs of 37 GRAMS ! ! That is insane ! ! ! ! ! Especially for only 17 little `` sugarless '' gummy bears . A Hershey 's Chocolate Bar only has 21 grams of carbs.Perhaps they are using corn syrup or some other blood sugar spiking sweeter . Maybe THAT 'S why they dont place an ingredients label on them . I am quite angry and feel that this company is committing FRAUD ! ! ! ! They say `` Safety InformationMade with Lycasin , a sugar alcohol . As with other sugar alcohols , people sensitive to this substance may experience upset stomachs . `` And yet.. the sugar-alcohol listed on the nutritional label says NOTHING ! ! ! Something is very very wrong here ! They put a legal disclaimer for their product here.. So , I guess they are covered . And Im betting that they know they are doing something dishonest and harmful ! ! ! ! IF YOU ARE AN INSULIN DEPENDENT DIABETIC ... RUN FOR YOUR LIFE ! ! ! ! ! ! This product may just kill you !	-1
Shortly after polishing off this entire bag of gummy bears and not dying of a heart attack or from the smell of the extreme flatulence that followed ( a side effect of the Lycasin used to sweeten these gummy bears ) . I quickly began receiving hate mail from members of P.E.T.A.. Apparently , they were upset because I am solely responsible for the lives of thousand bears and have in turn created a & # 34 ; gummy bear holocaust & # 34 ; . Some people even threatened violence against me ! One person even tried to break into my home , but they did not wait until the flatulence caused by these gummy bears went away and decided the smell was not worth it.One person even threatened to bring the & # 34 ; gummy bear liberation army & # 34 ; to my doorstep , and compared me to Hitler . Can you believe these P.E.T.A . people ? Dear Dean , I am writing to you in protest of your decimation of 5000 gummy bears , which is the gummy bear population of roughly one convenient store . You are to gummy bears what Hitler is to the Jews , except you might be worse because you let no color of gummy bear survive ! If this disrespect for gummy bears does not stop , I will line up the gummy bear liberation army at your doorstep , and we will save the gummy bears and put a stop to your evil ploy against gummy bears much like the free world put a stop to Hitler during World War 2.Can you believe these people ?	-1
I did get very gassy the night I purposely ate 1+ pound of this product ( but not smelly gas ) ... I have had constipation problems all of my life , and I assumed that I would not have the same results as others have written . I felt a bit bloated , and had several large hard BMs , and felt overly tired the next day . As for the candy aspect , they are tough to chew , and I would pick a different candy , even if it has sugar.Because my system is different from most , and you know your own body best , I would think strongly about whether you want Cascara Sageata , or there tough little bears .	-1
I 'm just saying , & # 34 ; Haribo macht kinder froh / und Erwachsene ebenso , & # 34 ; does NOT translate to & # 34 ; Kids and grown-ups love it so / the happy world of Haribo. & # 34 ; And therefore , I do not trust their English translation of the effects of this product to be very good either . Perhaps they downplayed the effect . I am not sure how they can keep selling these . Are people so very indifferent to whether they are eating food or totally nasty chemicals ? I suppose they might be useful for people who have a serious case of constipation , but why would you want to keep a product that someone might mistake for candy ?	-1
So like others I bought these without reading the reviews . I had a couple handfuls and paid for it as 6 hours later had the worse gas ever . They taste really good , but I ate too many of them ( even though 2 handfuls should n't be that much ) So now I eat in moderation , about 10 at a time , and I am ok.. But I wo n't buy them again- The side effects are n't worth it !	-1
I am very disappointed in the lack of concern for the customers of this product . There should be clear warnings re how this might affect many people re GI upset and gas etc..The taste is n't bad but I would think they could have made this product with less sugar alcohol and thus reduce the side effect considerably.I will not be re-ordering this product..other that stating it is sugar free..it is NOT low Calorie at all.Serving size : 17 pieces ( 41g ) Amount per serving : Calories : 160 ... ... might as well get the Full sugar version and NOT have the side effects ... Sorry..very very disappointed in this product	-1
I should have read the reviews before ordering . I thought ( there was my problem ) that these would be a great idea to add as a good snack when I had a candy crave that would n't derail my diet . WRONG.For the last couple of days I 've been wondering if I picked up a nasty stomach bug or something . I love gummy bears and jumped at these . That was my mistake . The taste is really quite good and my husband likes them too . Thankfully he 's smart enough to only enjoy a couple at a time and has n't yet been hit with the `` gummy bear cleanse '' . I do n't know what I 'm going to do with the rest of them.I can safely call these apocalypse bears . I started referring to them this way because they rather melted together in the bag . But after what they 've done to my system , there is no way I 'll ever buy these again . Stick to the normal gummy bears ! Please do listen to the other reviewers . The gas , the diarreah , the pain , it 's all true . This is horrible.On the up side , unlike many other sugarfree candies that do n't have good flavor , these do . Except the white ones . They 're rather bland to me.Flavorwise I would give this a rating of 4 stars . But because of the side-effects of the sugar substitute , I must give this a 2 stars and that might actually be generous . Sorry Haribo . I love love love your products , but this particular one really hates me .	-1
I WAS DISAPPOINTED . THEY ARE SWEET , BUT LOOK OUT IF YOU EAT MORE THAN 6 GUMMY BEARS . I NEARLY BLEW OUT THE COMMODE . I 'VE NEVER HAD A REACTION LIKE THIS . THEY MUST PUT A SWEETNER , THAT CAUSES THE EXPLOSIVE BOWEL MOVEMENTS .	-1
I love haribo and every chance I get I try a new product . These ... probably my biggest haribo disappointment . First they are sickeningly sweet ... So sweet it practically drowns out the strawberry flavor . I had a head ache and stomach ache from just a few pieces.Second , not gummy , more like a soft gelatin maybe ? There is no chewyness ... I can not believe I am even saying this , but seriously , go with trolli if you want the chewy strawberries and cream thing . They make great strawberry puffs	-1
This brand is chockful of artificial colors and junk . Shame on this company for putting this crap in their candy . I ordered 2 bags and when they got here and I read the ingredients I would n't even eat them . This stuff is n't fit for consumption . There should be an option for putting ZERO stars ! ! !	-1
I bought the Black Beans & Minestrone Soup cups for the auto-repair shop I work at . There 's 22 guys & the ones who tried the two flavors I bought - did n't get it again . I 'm a huge Black Beans & Rice fan but this brand was a bust . I found the beans stayed hard and the flavor was dull . Huge disappointment & tough to get rid of the last few cups ( except to the unsuspecting ) .	-1
In comparison to other soups , Nile Spice is extremely salty . The problem with this soup is that the beans are not cooked properly . Skip it .	-1
I love pea soup but there is no taste . Thank God for Ritz crackers as I was then able to consume . Only positive word I can use is very memorable as you will never forget it .	-1
I did a search for vegan candy and this was near top of list . But the product contains gelatin , which is made from animal bones , pigs and horses ' hooves . Very deceiving for Amazon , and potentially a legal suit in the making !	-1
Hard , not soft and chewy like it should be . Thought I got a bad batch but other bags were like that too . Yuck .	-1
Has a strong cherry flavor , presumably synthetic , but has a large , floppy , awkward shape.Needs to be eaten with a knife and fork ! Would not buy again .	-1
If I could give it -5 stars I would . It does n't taste like cherry at all . It tastes like a normal gummy bear candies you bought at the store , but these taste worst , they taste like they are loaded with SUGAR.Do not buy and think these are not sweet , they are so sweet with artificial sugars and colors.VERY BAD !	-1
They were very tough and my teenage boys would not eat them . I ended up giving them to a friend with a young child who had less discerning taste . Candy is candy at that age .	-1
That word sums it up , but I 'll add two more : bland and bricklike . The nicest thing I can say about this bread is that it has a decent crust when it first comes out of the oven . But seriously , people -- this is not even remotely like true French bread . It 's heavy and virtually flavorless . You can do much better . Then again , I have yet to enjoy a gluten-free bread that comes from a mix . I find it nearly as easy and far more satisfying to make my own .	-1
This breadmix is a sorry excuse for BREAD.I followed the instructions , the dough did rise , and scent from the oven was quite good.However , the finished product can be lethal.It is a heavy , hard , rock like bread when finished , and the manufacturer should changed description to `` WARNING , WMD ! `` Stick to Bob 's Redmill homemade wonderful bread mix . Now that 's a real bread !	-1
I looked forward to trying this for pizza crust , as it advertises . First of all , the directions for preparation use WAY too much liquid . Even by cutting the liquid down , I could never get my dough to look like anything other than paste . I 'd end up adding a bunch of gluten-free flours to get it to doughy consistency for pizza ( or so it , at least , would n't stick to my fingers and not the pan . ) It had NO flavor either . Disgusting pizza crust . And so I tried it for bread and I could n't even get my kids to eat it when I disguised it with garlic and cheese and butter . ( Kind of defeats the purpose of eating healthy , does n't it ? ) I would never buy this product again .	-1
I have made this bread 3 times now and feel that I can , finally , write a review . This mix is certainly not as advertised . The first time I thought it was me ... that I had done something incorrectly . But after 2 more baking sessions , I know it is not me . I made it in a bread machine ... .one that I had used for non-wheat free bread mixes . I followed directions to the letter . The regular breads were great ... so it 's not me or the machine . This `` bread '' is really dense and very , very dry . I can not eat it without sloshing down plenty of liquids . It 's like eating baked cardboard . I went to their website to see if I could get some recipes for this mix ( other than `` french bread '' and `` pizza crust '' ) and came up with nothing.I really wanted to like this product . I have been using Pamela 's baking mixes for a long time ... .not the bread mix ... but this does not compare favorably with Pamela 's products . Even their products are a little dense and dry , needing some serious cups of tea to get down . So far , I do not find that the gluten free mixes are that great . The one exception might be a brownie mix I got at Trader Joe 's .	-1
The first thing I noticed about this cereal was the unpleasant smell coming out of the bag . It was a bit like the little wood chips you put in pet cages . I tried an O and was underwhelmed . It tasted more or less like the weird smell , but with a strange sweetness that manages to register as `` sugar '' on the tongue but not add any flavor to the Os . Honey ? Nut ? No , none of that . Just woodsy grains and a separate aftertaste of sugar.I tried a bowl with milk . The texture is interesting , bigger , fluffier and crispier than Cheerios . Maybe a bit more like Apple Jacks ( or how I remember Apple Jacks to be ) . To be fair , the longer you let it sit in the milk , the better it becomes . ( Not much . Just a smidge . ) This is probably because the milk gives it some kind of a flavor . But that flavor is still not honey nut . Before the milk sets in , It 's bland and a little bitter , kind of like plain shredded wheat , and afterwards it 's only slightly sweeter . The bitterness is still prominent.To be fair , I suppose , I 'm not sure what I was expecting . I 've tried a lot of Glutino products and to say they 've been `` hit or miss '' would be an overstatement . Mostly they 've been `` miss '' or merely `` edible . '' A lot of them suffer from blandness , and several of them have this same weird `` wood chip '' flavor that reminds me of the pet store . I hold out hope that I will find something good , and on a rare occasion I do ( the English muffins are fantastic , even if they do n't look like the English muffins I 'm used to ) , but mostly I get disappointed . And when you 're paying $ 7 for a box of cereal , you can only afford to be disappointed so many times.I think I 'll stick to Chex and Gorilla Munch .	-1
When I read the reviews on the products ... I like to believe there is some truth to it . But serious ... this cereal just taste awful ! This was another gluten free product I tried based on the many positive reviews . It 's called `` Honey Nut '' , am I correct ? ! ! Yet it tasted like ... I ca n't even discribe the words . Nothing like I ever tasted ? Is it just me ? Had to give half of my boxes away . What a waste of money . I 'm getting so disappointed in this new gluten free stuff . I think I 'll just switch back to my NORMAL foods . Can anyone out there make anything gluten free that is n't disgusting ! ! ! Come on .	-1
I bought this cereal for my kids ( ages 6 and 7 ) who ca n't eat gluten any more . They wo n't eat it . I think it passes to at least finish the box but my kids would be happy to throw it out .	-1
I was expecting the kind of hot peppers you find added whole to Asian dishes in restaurants . After all they are called & # 34 ; Thai. & # 34 ; Sadly , these are pretty , but have almost NO flavor , hot or otherwise . For a point of reference , I do n't even like particularly hot food , and I could chew up a whole mouthful without a problem . If you cut one open and press your tongue on it there is a little hot flavor . I have now found out the peppers used in the restaurants are called Tien Tsin chili peppers .	-1
Does n't even really taste like Thai Tea . What you get is a rather non-descript sweet powdered drink . Even adding copious amounts of cream or condensed milk did n't help .	-1
The predominant flavor in the Knorr Teriyaki rice is dehydrated onion/leek . The ingredients list says dried leek and onion powder . It is just too much . It tastes like the bad dehydrated meals we used to eat on several day backpacking trips when I was a child.Other people love this as I can see from the reviews . I would say that you should consider what sort of palate you have to figure out whether you are in the love it or hate it group . If you are like me , then you think fast food tastes disgusting . You also think stevia tastes bitter , artificial sweeteners taste like poison , and you can taste every or almost every ingredient in a dish . You could probably recreate almost anything you have eaten just from taste alone . Did it have a dash of chili powder in it ? Yep , you could taste it . Was it made with pickled hot peppers instead of fresh ones ? You can tell just by taste . Was it made with crisco instead of butter ? You know immediately . If that is you , you will hate this product.One hour and a peach smoothie later and I still ca n't get the onion taste out of my mouth . A further glass of lemonade later , still tasting dehydrated/powdered onion .	-1
I found this one rather bland and dry , like most Mexican rice . The salsa I added was an improvement . For the same money I could buy a pound of rice and toss in some chili powder or taco seasoning , so I ca n't really recommend it .	-1
There is nothing special about this side dish . There is a hint of tomato , a hint of some other spices and a very vague ting of heat.The dish is VERY easy to prepare but there is nothing special about it nor anything terribly wrong either . There are no `` off-tastes '' - really there is not much taste - period.I 'm afraid bland says it all . To call this dish `` Mexican '' just seems terribly wrong . Rather customers should think of it as a fast cooking rice with a hint of tomato and a hint of red pepper.At the right price , I 'd recommend these Lipton/Knorr side dishes . They are extremely easy to prepare , have no off tastes -- yet they are hardly stellar or gourmet delights.My favorites in the Lipton/Knorr family are the Teriyaki Rice and the Stroganoff and Alfredo noodles .	-1
We used to love this rice . But the last time we bought it , we noticed that it does n't taste good anymore . So I pulled the wrapping out of the trash and read the ingredients list . They have changed the ingredients ! For sure they have added onion powder . Who knows what else they added . Now it tastes vaguely like dirty feet . I am so disappointed that they took the perfect formula and changed it for the worse . It used to be the best flavor they made we thought . What a bummer . The texture is still the same wonderful sticky , chewy goodness but the flavor is not good anymore . Someone should be fired over this -- maybe the company 's taste testers or whoever is running their food science department . Taking a wonderful product and making it bad definitely takes incompetence . ( Review updated in 2014 to reflect the product change . )	-1
I am a big fan of both the Knorr Roast Beef Au Jus Gravy mix and the Asian Style Chicken Broth mix and use them frequently not only because of their great flavor but also their lower sodium content . Because of this , I decided to give the Asian Chicken Fried Rice Sides and the Mushroom Rice Sides a try . What a huge disappointment ! Not only are they sticky and gummy texture-wise , they are virtually tasteless . Used both the stove top and microwave preparation directions and got the same poor results . Even tried adding some of the Knorr broth mixes , onions , parsley , garlic , other herbs , etc. , all to no avail . The remaining nine packages of each of these Rice Sides are already packed up to be delivered to the local Food Bank .	-1
I like using these Knorr ( and/or Lipton ) sides because it makes cooking less time consuming after a long , hard work day ; however , this particular one , I wo n't purchase again . The sauce was n't that tasty , and it actually gave my littlest a stomach ache . I DO recommend most others by Knorr , but not this one .	-1
I am sure there are many folks who love this but it was not for me . I was n't expecting it to be so hot and I did n't care for the taste.I gave all mine to a friend and they love it . The delivery was fine . I just did n't like the taste and ca n't give it any higher rating.This is a personal opinion and as I stated , many folks may love this..	-1
I tried the Inglehoffer in the hopes of finding a cheaper alternative toPommery Meaux Mustardwhich is delicious but extremely expensive . I was surprised and disappointed at how sweet the Inglehoffer tasted.I like my mustard vinegary and tangy which is how I would describe the Pommery as well asFrench 's Classic Yellow Mustard , neither of which adds any sugar . The Inglehoffer adds so much sugar that it becomes too dominant a flavor in the mustard . The added sugar can have the unexpected effect of turning a salty dish into a sweet dish . If I want a sweet dish , I 'll add the sugar myself . I do n't want my mustard doing it for me.If you prefer a sweet mustard , the Inglehoffer may work well for you . I , however , found it distasteful .	-1
This is our culture in a nutshell : a stone ground premium mustard made with the finest ingredients and then adulterated with artificial flavor enhancers and preservatives NONE OF WHICH ARE NEEDED OR IMPROVE THE MUSTARD .	-1
This mustard was too sweet for me . It tastes like it has pickle relish in it .	-1
These are probably sensible but taste awful , you ca n't even tell which fruit you are eating , yuckkkkkkkkkkkkkkkk .	-1
I WAS BUYING THIS THINKING OF REAL DRIED FRUIT BUT IT WAS NOT ! ! ! & IT DID NOT TASTE LIKE CANDY OR CHIPSTHAT WAS AWFUL SNACK FOR ME & WASTE OF MONEY	-1
very sweet and not too salty , with a somewhat odd , very starchy taste like raw corn . Pretty small portion but as a snack it 's relatively low in calories . I think I would have enjoyed these a lot more if the corn had been toasted to bring out some more complexity in flavor . They 're just really plain and uninspiring . Do n't think I 'd buy them again .	-1
I thought I was just getting freeze dried sweet corn , which I love . They add sea salt and it is sweet and salty . I told them a year ago they need to ditch the salt . A lot of people do not eat salt on corn . I see they have n't chaged it . They should read these reviews .	-1
I purchased November 2013 with expiration date Sept 2015 , opened Jul 2014 . The container seal was not damaged and the product does not smell or taste like the expected version I love . This container has notes of anise or fennel and possesses no sweet quantity . Since I can not buy locally to compare to another unit , I can not verify the company has changed the materials placed into this packaging . For the last few years , this has been my most loved basil , with floral notes adding my preferred level of sweetness to Italian dishes .	-1
When I received the products they were all melted and separated and they SMELLED SOUR . I put them in the fridge immediately . The next morning I checked them all out they were all separated with a thin layer of hard white fat on top of each beef . I bought 4 units total . I ca n't risk it being spoiled . So I tossed it out in the trash where it belongs . Why would anyone take 8 days to ship a perishable food item in 90 degree plus weather ?	-1
While I thought the concept of Tuna Jerky sounded like a good idea , in reality these fell short . The tuna was extremely hard and dry ; all moisture was lost in the curing process and left the tuna tasting more like hard paper . I enjoy the Salmon Jerky , but I will not be ordering the tuna again . From the brittle hard texture to the strange after taste , this tuna was disappointing .	-1
I just bought this product and the jerky was so hard I was afraid I would break a tooth .	-1
My husband and I did n't like this jerky . Tasted too strong and was salty . Smells powerful . It 's not a product I would buy again .	-1
We wanted to like this but it has two major problems . The first is the second ingredient a Worcestershire sauce has corn syrup in it as the second ingredient after water . They could have used sugar . Corn syrup is the mark of a poorly made , cheap , harmful product.Second it is REALLY tough . Tougher than any jerky I have ever tried , unpleasant with how tough . Everyone who tried it found it tough to the point of being painful . And this was well before the expiration date . Unfortunately I bought the 8 pack . I will not be buying again.And this really upsets me from the product page : `` There are also no artificial colors , flavors , enhancers , or ingredients in their products '' . Really ? How is corn syrup natural ? It has to be created in a lab in an industrial process that more often than not leaves mercury in it . It is about as natural as a plastic Barbie doll . Should be able to get a refund based on that deceptive statement alone .	-1
item . Reasonably priced for such a large quantity and with Prime no shipping costs . I have not had a chance to use any of the garlic yet but I know the quality of Tone 's products . I am very much looking forward to using this product . I have now used this product ; it tastes good but I am not happy with the parent company `` ACH companies Inc. , Memphis , TN 38016 USA . I am going to write a separate letter to the company how disappointed I am this garlic was imported from China and packed in the USA .	-1
taste is ok , once you scrape the mostly crumbs of what used to be jerky into your fingers ; there are no strips , biggest piece about an inch , as though run over by car , so someone has to be doing this better than snackmasters	-1
WOW THIS HAS CHANGED , HAS SOME BITTER TASTE TO IT . I USE TO USE THE BEEF GRAVY ONE . THIS IS WEIRD TASTING . DID THEY CHANGE THE INGREDIENTS . I AM JUST GOING TO USE THESE AND NOT BUY THIS ONE . CHICKEN IS OK , JUST ORDERED TURKEY WE 'LL SEE .	-1
Not like the McVities I remember in the UK . These darned things have what is described as a milk flavor coating . The ones I remember had a hard , thick , tasty chocolate coating . Okay , they may be better cookies than are American ones , on average , but I would say stay away from them . Buy the Walkers Stem Ginger biscuits which really are a treat and can be served as such to guests on special occasions . I suspect that the other biscuits by Walker , all made with butter , are just as good.. McVities claims that it does not use hydrogenated oil , but it does use a range of other oils .	-1
I was really not impressed with this . It does n't have much flavor to it , onion or otherwise . It has a tendency to clump , so if I 'm adding it to a soup or something I end up with little onion powder balls throughout . I 've never had that problem before . It just does n't taste right .	-1
Not impressed with the flavor.There are others with much better flavor.The grind is very very small.It may be okay for soups and stews but too powdery for sprinkling onto anything solid like a rub.In fact the directions says to mix with the broth of what you plan on adding it to first.I will probably use what I have for a brining solution for pork and chicken , along with salt and sugar .	-1
unless you 're cooking for a big crowd and do n't like the idea of mincing 5 # of onions this does n't seem to have much utility ; onions are too easy to keep around and the only negative is & # 34 ; storage onions & # 34 ; that are too bitter	-1
Whenever you cook with GF pastas , it 's important to COOL IMMEDIATELY when it 's al dente to prevent it from overcooking and falling apart to mush . This is a different technique than cooking with wheat-based pastas , but pastas that are rice-based have to be managed differently , for good reason . It does n't have to be cold , but you do have to drop it below the cooking temperature , so drain it and return it to the pan and fill the pan with lukewarm tap water . The heat from the pan will keep it at a good serving temperature , but the lukewarm tap water will cool the pasta below cooking temperature to keep it from breaking down.In fairness , this product does n't hold up as well as Pastariso or Tinkyada brands do for a GF pasta , though.Much better pasta is available from Mrs. Leepers and Tinkyada . Mrs. Leepers is more like what you 'd expect for taste and texture from a wheat pasta , but it 's so thin , it can fall apart easily , too . Tinkyada holds up well , cooks up al dente every time , and does n't have any funny taste . Tinkyada is the favorite for our family and friends who do n't have to avoid gluten . This De Boles pasta has a really weird aftertaste . Even if you cook it per instructions and run cold water over it immediately , it falls apart . It does n't hold up for twirling onto a fork.Whenever a friend contacts me to get info to help someone newly diagnosed who needs gluten free foods ( whether it 's for celiac , gluten intolerance , wheat allergy , fibromyalgia , chronic fatigue , rheumatoid arthritis , ADHD , autism , leaky gut , or brain function ) , I always provide them with a care package of some of these : Tinkyada Brown Rice Pasta , Spaghetti , Organic , 12-Ounce ( Pack of 6 ) ( or other of the Tinkyada pastas ) , Ancient Harvest Quinoa Organic Pasta Gluten Free , Elbows , 8-Ounce Boxes ( Pack of 12 ) , Pastariso Organic Brown Rice Angel Hair , 8-Ounce ( Pack of 12 ) , Sam Mills Pasta D'Oro Gluten Free Penne Rigate , 1-Pound ( Pack of 6 ) , Natural Nectar Gluten Free Cracklebred , Sun Dried Tomato & Oregano , 3.5-Ounce Boxes ( Pack of 12 ) San J Organic Wheat Free Tamari Soy Sauce Gold Label Travel Packs , 200-Count PackagesI usually throw in a box of General Mills Rice Chex and a box of General Mills Honey Nut Chex , too.I have these on Subscribe & Save to keep my pantry stocked for use in RECIPES to replace Campbell 's soups and Knorr bouillon cubes , a completely even substitution , gluten free ( GF ) , safe for Celiac Disease sufferers .

I suppose if you can not find any other GF pasta , this will do , but IMHO the texture & taste is not nearly as good as other brands I have tried , incl Schar , Tinkyada , and especially not as good as PastaMia ( by Heinz ) . I will not buy this brand again .	-1
Gave it away after trying it in a curry dish . Tasteless , unpleasant texture . Will not buy again . Will not buy again ( needed 3 more words ) .	-1
Bearitos and Little Bear are terrible these days . Do n't bother .	-1
Upon opening the bags , there was a very strong odor of rancid oil . I opened them all , and it was the same . I assumed there would be no refund for opened bags of chips , so I ended up throwing all 12 bags into the garbage .	-1
I ordered these hoping they would be crisp and healthy . My experience with Amazon has always been prompt with fresh not expired food but not this time . The bags I received had expired 5 months previous to when I ordered them . My chips were stale .	-1
At one time this was my favorite guilty pleasure . Sadly , there 's nothing left to enjoy in these dry , flavorless packing peanuts .	-1
Little Bear has gone WAY downhill in the last 5-10 years . Do n't bother .	-1
This product is good , but tastes rather bland . I reviewed the label and compared it to other brands . Here are some alternative : - Orville Redenbacher 's `` Light Natural '' has fewer calories , the same amount of fat/sodium , better flavoring ( palm oil ) , larger bags ( 3.3 vs 2.8 oz ) , and costs approximately half as much since Redenbacher frequently goes on sale . IMHO the `` light natural '' variety is a more attractive choice.- Healthy Choice Popcorn is another alternative with many of the same benefits listed above , although I do n't think it tastes as good as Redenbacher 's `` Light Natural '' brand.I wo n't be buying anymore of Bearito 's , not because there 's anything wrong with it , but just because there are better-tasting options that are just as healthy . : - )	-1
I appreciate the idea of having a healthy organic snack to offer my family , but clearly this is not the mouthwatering , melt-in-your-mouth kind of popcorn that one would expect . This stuff is so bad ( tough and hard to chew ! ) ; nobody in my family will eat it . I tried eating some , and with every mouthful I was spitting hulls in the trash . I discarded more than I swallowed . I would recommend that this popcorn be taken off the market , as it is not fit for human consumption . It seems more like the type that should be fed to farm animals or maybe used for Christmas tree decorations . I often buy organic products and have found that , many times , the taste and quality is not as good as it should be . I would not recommend this product .	-1
AGAIN , KIND OF A DOWNER COMPARED TO THE FANTASTIC FOODS BRAND . I KNOW THE INGREDIENTS ARE VERY SIMILAR , BUT SOMETHING IN THE TASTE AND CONSISTENCY IS JUST NOT SPOT ON . LOOK FOR THE `` FANTASTIC FOODS '' BRAND AND DO YOURSELF A FAVOR .	-1
My husband has gluten sensitivity , so we 've tried several gluten-free pastas . This one does not hold together , even with the minimum cook time , and it turns into smaller bits , making my pot of spaghetti runny and not noodly enough . I wo n't buy it again .	-1
I tried this spaghetti with the hopes that it would in some way resemble the wheat pasta I used to love to eat , but it does n't even come close . The taste is ricey and bland , and it falls apart despite following the cooking directions . There are many good wf/gf pasta products out there these days , but this is n't one of them .	-1
got it from local grocer , did n't want to wait for shipping . strangely , its not bad and no chemical taste unlike their instant line , maybe its diluted or the coffee in this was not tainted . i do have to take about 15 tsps to get a strong enough hit though.but then there is this mild throat irritation.and it did fade to too little rush remaining for contentment . i had something sweet , a peanut butter fluff sandwich . and then i took like 5 tsps more . and then i just got this `` something does n't feel right '' feeling , it was n't a sick sensation . i do n't get it.i just i should switch back to folgers brewed , even though it weak in a way compared to instant when it was good , there were no `` mild throat irritation '' and/or `` something does n't feel right '' feeling .	-1
Okay , yes , I know the brand is Dr. Kracker and maybe that should have been a clue as to the texture of this product . However , I have had flatbreads made by other companies that were actually the texture of a pita . These are VERY crunchy and do n't have a whole lot of flavor . If you are shopping for a super-healthy cracker , this may be it . If you are looking for a whole grain flatbread with the texture of a pita , keep shopping - this is not it . My next venture for this product is to grind it up and use as bread crumbs on top of broiled tilapia .	-1
This kracker had me hooked when i first started buying them , but they have really gone downhill . There were practically no pumpkin seeds or cheese on this last batch . They also tasted a little flat - seemed to get stale a lot quicker than they should have . I was a faithful customer , but will no longer buy this product . They 're too expensive to get a box of stale , dry , cardboard .	-1
I love Lipton tea , love green tea ( I actually prefer it over black now ) , and like berries , so how bad could this be , right ? Well , it is NOT good ! This has a strange taste that I could not necessarily identify , and did n't care for.I used to drink herbal tea blends , and to me , this tastes more like a berry herbal concoction than green tea.I could only get through half a glass . I tried adding some sweetener , but that made it worse.I 'll stick with plain green tea.Not sure what to do with all the leftover packets ... like most Liptons , they only have a paper pouch , so no way to truly keep them fresh . They 'll get tossed into a zip baggie and probably sit until discarded.Very disappointing flavor.I can not recommend anything but avoiding this one .	-1
How could you people like this crap ? ! The more I use it the more I hate it . My family tells me it tastes just like sugar . I 'm not sure that they ever actually had sugar ! I 'm stuck with using this in my coffee until I get my favorite sweetener called Ideal in the mail . I may run out and buy sugar as a back up until i get my sweetener . The tast of this is vile . the after taste is horrid . I might as well be putting fermented bile in my coffee ! bleh ! ! ! ! !	-1
Amazon sells a 700-ct for $ 15..why would i ever pay $ 35 for 1000-ct ( plus shipping on 1000-ct ) ... .seems crazy . Look up the 700-ct and you 'll be siked .	-1
Please note that I am not a vegetarian and that being gluten free is not a selling point to me . I understand that many of you are interested in this item for those reasons , so this review may not be helpful to you.That said , this sauce tastes terrible . There is very little flavor despite being packed with my different ingredients . It tastes like a poorly salted tomato puree . If you like very , very plain flavors then this might be for you . If you do n't have to worry about a product being gluten free then just about any brand you pull off a shelf at your local grocer will taste better than this . As for specific recommendations , try either Rao 's or Mario Batali 's arrabbiata sauces . Both are delicious .	-1
Maybe it 's because of the freezing cold , or perhaps the vendor is supplying improperly handled products ? These snaps are mostly broken & dry . Buyer beware , the one I bought from the local 7 Eleven were firm & tasty . These are dry and crumbly without the buttery honey sesame taste we all love .	-1
I bought these originally thinking they were honey and sesame . As it turns out , they are sugar and sesame . They do taste great but traditionally this type of snack should have honey instead of sugar . If you are looking for a honey and sesame snack , there are others available through Amazon that contain honey instead of sugar , among those are [ Joyva Sesame Crunch Candy ] . If you are looking for a sugar alternative snack that is all natural , that is your best bet .	-1
If you 've never tried a raspberry chipotle before this sauce will likely blow your mind and jam your radar ( or at the least tickle your taste buds ) ! But once the initial awe of the raspberry and chipotle combination subsides and you begin to try other brands , you will quickly realize that this Razzpotle is VERY AVERAGE . I have tried at least 6 different raspberry-chipotle brands and the best one by far isD.L . Jardine 's Buckin ' Berry Rasberry Chipotle Sauce . The Buckin ' Berry is thicker and the Razzpotle is quite liquidy . The Buckin ' Berry has way more flavor and kick !	-1
If you put this sauce in your mouth , you 'll have the urge to quickly remove it . It tastes awful . Not much more to say about it . Not much more I can say about it . Bleh !	-1
If I had to use one word to sum up this product , it would be the following : '' Overwhelming '' The sauce is thick , which is good for marinating or spreading on a burger or ribs or what have you , but it 's so rich and sweet that it really dominates the flavor of whatever it is that you put it on . Furthermore , the mixture is such that when grilling with it , the sauce caramelizes and chars if the heat is too intense . That 's a whole different mess . If you like really sweet heavy sauces this is for you , but I 'll pass on using this again .	-1
First and foremost , I agree with the reviewer that said this sauce needs to be strained to be truly useful . The flavor is okay , although I personally would prefer more spicy chipotle in the balance . I will probably add some powdered chipotle seasoning to the remainder of this bottle . Also , I think it 's pretty darn pricey , more than I would be willing to pay .	-1
Fischer and Wieser 's `` The Original Roasted Raspberry Chipotle Sauce '' is made with ripe raspberries and chipotle peppers and comes in a 20 ounce bottle . It is all-natural with no added preservatives and does n't have too much sodium . It is smoky , sweet , and spicy and can be used in a number of different ways . It can be used as an accompaniment with any meat , fish or fowl such as steak , pork tenderloin , chicken wings , or trout . It can also be used as a salad dressing or poured over soft cheese and served with crackers.While it is quite versatile , I had a lot of issues with `` The Original Roasted Raspberry Chipotle Sauce '' . To start with , it was hard to open and when I did get it open it was hard to pour . When I did get it to pour , too much sauce came out . Once I poured it , it was messy and spilled over the bottle . The raspberry seeds made it too lumpy and the seeds stuck in my teeth . As for the taste , it was too sweet for my taste and not nearly spicy enough . I 'd prefer fewer raspberries and more chipotle . `` The Original Roasted Raspberry Chipotle Sauce '' is the number one selling item for Fischer and Wieser , but I found it to be disappointing .	-1
If this sauce was a perfume , I would say that it had an initial fruity top note and a quick dry down to a very hot and spicy kick . The flavor is definitely layered , which I found interesting . As an ardent fan of `` Top Chef '' and `` Iron Chef '' , I have been wanting to try a gourmet chipotle sauce since chipotles seem to be an ingredient which are used more and more often to add `` heat '' to dishes on these competition-type cooking shows . To be honest , I did n't really know exactly what a chipotle was until I tried this sauce and then looked up the definition of `` chipotle '' .Wikipedia defines the flavor of chipotles as `` relatively mild but with earthy spiciness . '' I 'm afraid my taste buds are a little more sensitive than that . I found the heat in this sauce to be very hot indeed . I like the initial rush of raspberry flavor in the sauce , which reminds me of my mother 's homemade red raspberry preserves . Only when the fruit flavor is firmly on one 's tongue does the chipotle spicy kick come -- and it just tackles my tongue like a pro football linebacker . I 'm afraid I did n't care for it very much.I tried the sauce as recommended , as a complement to chicken and to soft cheese and crackers . But I just could n't fall in love , or even like , with this condiment . I found the sweet fruitiness coupled with the spicy kick discordant.Perhaps someone who loves chilies and loves hot sauces would like this sauce . Perhaps a tabasco lover looking for something a little different . But it just is n't for me .	-1
I tried this out on a number of people with varying tastes ranging from those who prefer sweet to spicy barbecue sauces . Nobody liked it at all , and nobody would give it another shot . With that said , I 'll stick to masterpiece and doctor it up .	-1
The ingredient label on this product shows that sugar is in first place , and that 's pretty obvious when you taste this syrupy concoction - it is sweet ! This thing tastes more like jam or pancake syrup to me than a `` sauce . '' If you look at all the raving reviews people have written so far , though , my review is bound to be unpopular and invite sneers . But too bad , I think this sauce is way too sweet and also not worth the money.If you use it as a bbq marinade ( which I did not do ) and let it smoke and blacken some on the grill , I think that would be a good use for it because it needs something to transform it from its original state ( unless you put it on pancakes or waffles ) . From the bottle I just find that while it does have a slight kick of chipotle , it is far too one-dimensional to justify so many raves . I have to believe all the highly favorable reviews come from people with a sweet tooth . When first tasting it , it does taste very good . But it gets tiring very quickly . I received a bottle as a Vine sample but I would not spend my own money to purchase one .	-1
I just loved my first taste - sweet , smoky , spicy . A very addictive combination of flavors . I thought I 'd try it in a stir fry and I found it to be much too sweet and overpowering . The main ingredient is sugar and it seems like the heat comes from the jalapenos and the smokiness from the chipotle . I really did n't mind the raspberry seeds . This sauce is n't really to my liking and I ca n't see myself using it for cooked dishes because I think it will mask and overpower any other flavors.Taste is a personal thing and I can imagine many others liking it but it 's not for me .	-1
Sweet and Sour Sauce on Steroids ; Sugar Addicts Delight ; Trailer Trash Ketchup ; you choose the best title.Sweet ? Of course it is sweet . This stuff is forty-five percent sugar ; sweet enough to melt your teeth . Not a surprise that everyone likes it . If you liked the cereal which was only thirty percent sugar , this fluid is half again better.This concoction goes all the way back to 1996 . That was a whole millennium ago . It has `` garnered international acclaim . '' Just look at the reviews before Vine . Have you ever seen so many five-star two-sentence puff pieces ? The label tells it all . `` Great right out of the jar . '' We should have a contest to find the best new use . My plastic bottle arrived in near-zero weather , still liquid . Could we use it as windshield-washer fluid ? I have tried it on salad , cheese , and beef . It works on everything . There is nothing subtle about it . The flavor overwhelms anything that you apply it to . My favorite ? I poured a big glob into my coffee . It really adds some zing and the seeds are not a problem ; they sink right to the bottom . Maybe I could take a liking to this after all ...	-1
This is a sweet and spicy concoction which is a little less on the spicy side than I expected . Pour it on any type of fish , or chicken dish . I also checked using with Cheddar cheese on crackers , it did n't taste good , but if you mix with olive oil and vinegar it serves as a good salad dressing . The manufacturers claim that there are no preservatives , which should be a plus , since most preservatives destroy the original taste . The sauce contains raspberry seeds that may not be satisfactory to few consumers.1.Louisiana Chipotle Pepper Hot Sauce , 3-Ounce Bottles ( Pack of 12 ) 2.Chef Paul Prudhomme 's Magic Seasoning Blends ~ Magic Sauce & Marinade - Southwest Chipotle3.Mrs .

I have been trying this sauce for a while before I decide to weigh in on my opinion . Overall , it started out all right in the beginning . It was extremely strong so I had to use only a little bit to get the taste of it . I tried it on hot dogs and was actually pretty good . Zesty , tangy , sweet , smokey , and a little bit of spice . It was n't as good on sandwiches.Then I tried one of the recipes that came with the bottle . I used cream cheese , crackers , and the sauce . If you use just a small amount of the sauce , it was pretty good since too much meant way too sweet . This brings me to one thing I noticed right off the bat about the design of the bottle . It was too easy to just pour too much of the sauce on things . The bottle opening is just an opening and has nothing to keep you from pouring too much of the sauce on your items . Plus , it was very easy to spill the sauce over.EDIT : looking back at it , I believe this product did n't make me sick . Rather , it was a bug that I caught . Either way , the taste is pretty decent but just a bit strong tasting to me .	-1
This tapenade tastes of vinegar and vegetable oil , but sadly not of olive oil . It 's tolerable as a topping on a fish fillet or even grilled beef , but left to its own devices , with its own flavor `` shining '' fully through , it 's a pretty bad tapenade . I 'll be inventing ways to use up the remaining 5 , but never ordering again .	-1
Edit : I had to take this down to one star . This product just is n't worth it . We only got to consume 5 of the 6 jars we purchased , due to the opened jar.We 're just finishing the 4th of 5 , and I had to go and delete this off of our subscribe and save . I 'm not sure if the problem is inconsistency , or if we just had enough , but this last jar tastes tinny . It has a metallic taste , even when mixed in with cream cheese , but it is more noticeable when the tapenade is eaten by itself on a cracker.I 'm going to throw the last jar away , and chalk this up to experience . This is just not good tapenade ... you can find much better , for a lower price , in a grocery store . ( Or , make your own ! ) Below is my previous review , which I 'm leaving up ... who knows ! Someone may actually prefer a metallic taste in their olives ! This olive tapenade has a good , but mild flavor . Personally , I could use a little more garlic ! I 've mixed it with some goat cheese and another occasion with cream cheese , both were very good spreads for crackers ! As a sandwich spread it works well and adds a nice unexpected flavor.One of our jars was opened and leaking when we got the package , although I do n't know if this is an ongoing problem ... we 'll see with the next shipment !	-1
In my opinion , this type of olive is n't good for an olive spread . Of course , I had no way of knowing that until I bought it and tried it . For this reason , I do n't recommend it .	-1
My family uses Classico , which is O.K . but not great . Based upon the fabulous reviews of this product on Amazon we tried Scarpetta . Not impressed favorably . No flavor other than tomato , no suggestion of spices or garlic and a very sour aftertaste that both my wife and I noted . We have n't yet tried the Bolognese but are not expecting much there , either , as the label shows no garlic and it is made without meat . The purchaser is supposed to add his own meat . Bolognese is traditionally simmered a long time ( as are other Italian sauces ) which allows the meat flavor to meld with the other flavors.Jars arrived intact but I do n't understand the excitement over the jars . I ca n't think of a use to which I can put them that would n't be better served by plastic containers with snap on lids . Therefore I wo n't be re-using them .	-1
This is a delicious tapenade , 5 stars for the food product itself . The problem is Amazon.I ordered my first box of 6 jars several months ago and recently decided to reorder it . I 've nothing but praise for the delicious product . The problem is Amazon 's shipping department.My first reordered box , which arrived in late May , was a disgusting , lumpy , discoloured cardboard confection of 6 jars in a tight cardboard box with heavy plastic shrink wrap , shipped inside a flimsy , small , outer shipping box . It was clear that jar ( s ) inside had broken in shipping at some point . Almost 4/5 of the cardboard inner box was discoloured with oil and food staining - over half the box , there was mould growing . It was repulsive.I called Amazon , reported this , they sent a replacement , and I threw out the entire mouldy package , unopened.I received the replacement package last week . Again the box of 6 jars was sealed in an inner cardboard box with heavy plastic shrink wrap ( and inside a larger Amazon shipping box , properly packaged ) . Regardless , there was again some discoloured cardboard over one end of the inner box ( thankfully no mould ) .I opened the inner box to examine the contents . Four jars of tapenade were spotless , in perfect shape , so I kept them . The other two jars had packaging soaked in oil and discolouration . The metal screw tops on both jars had been badly dented and damaged , allowing the oil and food to seep out - and undoubtedly , since this is a tomato product , allowing bacteria to seep into the jars . I threw out these two jars , as their condition posed a serious health hazard.Upon examining all parts of the packaging , I observed that the larger shipping box and air-filled-pouches padding material inside were well assembled , unstained , and not the cause of the damage . Clearly the smaller , shrink-wrapped cardboard box holding the 6 jars had been damaged *before* it was packed into the larger shipping box . It appears that the shrink-wrapped inner box had been dropped or crushed just on one end ( damaging the two jars and their lids mentioned above ) . So although Amazon 's shipping department is blameless for its good packaging job , Amazon 's warehouse department ( pre-shipping ) not only damaged the smaller box of jars , but then sent them on to be shipped to a customer ! ! This is deplorable behaviour . I will no longer be ordering this delicious tapenade from Amazon and will demand further refund for this fiasco . I 'm angry and very disappointed .	-1
I suppose this would make a good dip for chicken wings or other fried things , but it is far too sweet to use as a marinade or glaze . Not too hot , though , so do n't get scared by the habanero in the name . The flavor is good , but because it is so sweet , I 'm unsure what to use this with . Not the steak or pork chop sauce I thought it might be .	-1
Let me open by explaining something : I believe that good cooking requires some subtlety . A little restraint perhaps . But there 's a school of cooking that seems to think that all you really need to make good food is to either a ) deep fry it or b ) pour a hell of a lot of sauce all over it . The actual food you 're cooking seems to be fairly unimportant , taking a back seat to the fry-a-lator or the sauce-o-squirter . Fischer & Weiser Mango Ginger Habanero Sauce would fit right into a kitchen like that.It 's not that it tastes bad , because it does n't - not really anyway . The ginger flavor comes through fairly well ( and I like ginger ) and it finishes with a well balanced heat that 's on the mild side , but nice all the same . Those are n't the problems . The real issue is that it 's that it 's absurdly sweet . As in candy sweet . As in `` forget tasting what you 're pouring it on '' sweet . And it 's thick too . Which is neither here nor there ( I do n't have any real preference in that regard ) but it 's relevant if you do n't want WAY too much sauce on what you happen to be flavoring.On the upside , it 's made with sugar ; no corn syrup ( high fructose or otherwise ) fouls the bottle . And I did like the underlying flavors , so if you dig really sweet and thick sauces , you may well enjoy this ( and hence my two star rating ) .For me though , I 'd have to agree with the ( really poorly printed ) label when it refers to this product as a `` finishing and dipping sauce '' ; dipping food I 'm eating in this sauce would pretty much finish it for me .	-1
Sugar is the second ingrediant listed and you can taste it . I have tried other products that mix the hot and sweet with success . This marinade just did not suit my tastebuds . Now , to be fair-my family loved it . Yet since I was reviewing and I am the only only to shop , I rated it with my viewpoint .	-1
I gave this stuff a try after I fell in love with the Fischer & Wieser Raspberry Chipotle Sauce , which I mixed with olive oil to make into salad dressing . This Mango Ginger Habanero Sauce is nothing special in my book , for several reasons . First , it is much TOO SPICY for my wimpy taste buds . The Raspberry Chipotle had some bite , but I could handle it . Not this stuff . Second , the flavor combination here does n't knock me off my feet , like the Raspberry Chipotle variety . The mango and ginger flavors are quite strong , and not complementary , in my opinion . Third , this sauce is not as versatile as the Raspberry Chipotle Sauce . I expected that I would be able to make it into salad dressing , but the bottle had no such suggestions , as with the Raspberry Chipotle . It seems to be good for fewer types of uses . Anyway , it was worth a try , and it was not horrible . My expectations were just too high after trying their Raspberry Chipotle Sauce .	-1
I had high expectations of something called `` Mango Ginger Habanero '' sauce and was more than a bit let down after trying this sauce on grilled chicken . This is three of my favorite flavors rolled into one so my anticipation was high . Instead , it just very sweet taste that reminded me of something I 'd dip chicken fingers from a chinese restaurant in versus the expected caribbean zing I was looking forward to . I just did n't expect a duck sauce knock-off . Where was the kick ? Habanero is supposed to be hot ! I got little mango from this , no ginger and very little heat at all . I was definitely left wanting a more intense flavor and kick .	-1
Do not be fooled by the name . I could not taste the ginger ( no ginger after bite ) at all and barley the habanero only after several tastes . Sauce is really way too sweet ( too much honey for me ) , but makes a good honey glazed chicken for the kids . This is a dipping-finishing sauce so is supposed to be used after food is prepared .	-1
I was very excited to receive the Mango Ginger Habanero sauce , as I LOVE the Roasted Raspberry Chipotle by Fischer & Wieser . This sauce was a big disappointment . The sauce is too sweet with only a little flavor and a small amount of heat . The raspberry chipotle is bursting with flavors , so I was expecting much more from the mango ginger . I do not plan to buy this sauce in the future .	-1
This sauce was sweeter than I thought it should be with not much exciting flavor . Sort of like the duck sauce that comes in packets at the Chinese takeout , but with some peppery heat mixed in . I detected very little in the way of mango , and the ginger taste was missing too.We tried it with some grilled chicken . Perhaps some egg rolls might have been a better pairing.Normally I like sweetness in a dipping sauce , but it must have flavor behind it , else it risks being rather insipid , like this . Would not purchase again .	-1
Personally , I found this too sweet for my taste . The sweetness was the level I would expect from a dessert topping . Not that this is not without its uses . I think that this would make a perfect topping for my waffles , which I am going to try . The habanero is misleading . I detected no heat level at all . It is very similar to a spiced pineapple topping I once tried over ice cream .	-1
I was quite impressed by Fischer & Weiser 's Raspberry Chipotle sauce and had high expectations for the Mango Ginger Habanero flavor . While I really enjoyed the texture and complexity of the Raspberry Chiptole , I find this one to be sort of boring.Much of the essence of a fresh ripe mango is lost upon bottling . While I can taste a hint of ( cooked ) mango , it is overpowered by the sweetness and flavor of honey . They should have named it Honey Ginger Spicy Sauce . I can taste a good amount of ginger in the middle of my palate , which then gives way to a moderate level of heat from the habanero . While the heat is present , I ca n't actually taste the unique bright flavor of habaneros in the sauce.The texture is thick and syrupy . It kind of looks like the nasty brown sauce they use in the neighborhood Chinese-American restaurants . Like it 's been thickened with a ton of cornstarch .	-1
I am a foodie . So , any sauce has to really impress me . The name sounds good , like a unique flavor has been discovered . Unfortunately , the sauce is overly sweet , the mango lost in the sweetness and the ginger is almost indiscernible in the mess of flavors . Turns out , if you add a bunch of flavors and mix them all up , it tastes like ... a mix of flavors that totally neutralizes any nuances . You can easily make a sauce like this , a sweet/hot sauce , and there are plenty out there that are good straight from the bottle instead of wanting to grab the spice rack to `` fix '' this sauce . Not terrible , but not very good , either .	-1
Did not like the taste at all . I love mango but something was not jelling for me with the taste .	-1
This `` sweet heat '' mango sauce with a touch of Habanero peppers is somewhat thick and viscous that contains more mangos than Habanero . Hence I found this a little sweeter than the hot sauce I am used to . I tried this on grilled chicken sandwich , and baked fish sandwich ; it tasted good , but you may want to add other condiments to spice it up depending upon your taste . If you use this while grilling or baking it tastes better than adding after grilling/baking . I tried this sauce also on Chinese food and it works well.1.El Yucateco Green Habanero Sauce , 8 oz.2.El Yucateco Extra Hot Habanero Sauce , 4 oz.3.Pickapeppa Hot Mango Sauce4.Earth & Vine Mango Horseradish Seafood Sauce & Dip5.Pomegranate & Mango Chipotle Sauce ( 15.75 ounce ) by [ .. ]	-1
I received this sauce from the Vine program . I used it to glaze some chicken , and tasted it on a teaspoon as well . The sause did not have a very lpeasant taste by itself , almost soapy . I thought that possibly cooking it on something would help to enhance the sweetness of it , and I was incorrect . It still tasted soapy , only hotter.The sauce does have a very nice bite to it from the habanero , but the ginger tastes overpowering and really manipulates the flavor too much .	-1
As a fan of spicy foods , I was anxious to try out this sauce . The habanero is one of my favorite peppers , adding great flavor and heat . Unfortunately , this product diluted the habanero taste so that it was n't significant at all.I tried this sauce as a cooking glaze and a dip with beef , chicken , and pork . If you 're looking for sweetness , it adds a very pleasant flavor . Unfortunately , that 's not what I 'm looking for in a sauce that boasts habanero . The mango , honey , and apple flavors dominate this sauce . The ginger is also apparent , but not as pronounced . The poor , poor habanero is absolutely lost in the shuffle.Overall , this sauce is a pretty big disappointment to me . If it were advertised and marketed as a fruity sauce , I 'd be much happier with the product . The company advertises this product as having `` sweet heat '' . Well , it got half of it right .	-1
I wanted to like Ginger Habanero Sauce but I found the taste of this sauce very cloying . At first I thought it was not hot at all ... But then the habanero kicked in and my tastebuds were on fire.The overall effect was like eating a mouthful of what you 'd expect flowers to taste like mixed with habanero . I might 've liked it better if it were more mild , but I need to keep my stomach lining as happy as possible.2 stars . Not my favorite sauce .	-1
The ingredients of this sauce sound interesting -- mango , ginger , and habanero peppers . The problem is that the sauce is terribly sweet . The mango puree , honey , and sugar contribute too much sweetness which is not offset enough by the peppers . The ginger flavor is virtually lost . We tried the sauce on chicken and the sauce overpowered it , almost completely masking the chicken 's flavor . We figured it would devastate fish , so we never tried it on fish . Of course , foods are a matter of individual taste , so if you tend to prefer sweetness in cooked foods , you might enjoy this sauce . However , if your want a sauce to accent rather than dominate a main course , look elsewhere . This one is n't for you .	-1
I bought a case of this sauce because a lot of reviewers said it was good tasting . The seals on two of the jars were broken or possibly broken and I was too chicken to try them so I just threw them away . Overall , I thought the flavor was good but not great . After chucking two of the four I obviously felt I overpaid . This will go down as probably the worst food I 've bought through Amazon and I definitely wo n't buy it again .	-1
This topping has a very nice flavor and makes tasty bruschetta . But be careful about the seals on the jars . I 've have several arrive with the vacuum seal broken and when the jars were opened , a very unappetizing fuzzy growth presented itself . Amazon replaced the defective jars but I always wonder whether they are going to be good or not .	-1
I have bought Artichoke Bruschetta spread at Costco and I have made it myself . I love the stuff . I was pretty excited to see this available on amazon . It even comes beautifully packaged . Unfortunately this is a poorly seasoned tomato sauce with a few chunks of pitted olives and artichokes floating in it . It is not really thick enough to be a bruschetta topping and I really did not care for the way it was seasoned at all . It had an almost licorice taste to it that overpowered everything else . I am not even sure how I can doctor it into something we will eat . I am bummed .	-1
I hate to disagree with most of the other reviews , but this tea tastes flat , bland and a bit bitter . I 've searched for a decent decaf tea and finely found three , two here on Amazon , and for less money than the Taylors . Bigelow Organic Breakfast Blend is the best . It has a rich , deep , aromatic flavor and goes well with a bit of sugar and milk or just plain . Higgins and Burke decaffinated Orange Pekoe is lighter in flavor than the Bigelow , but still offers deep amber richness . The third is n't sold on Amazon , but hopefully they 'll add it as they carry the Peet 's brand coffee . Peet 's decaffinated English Breakfast loose tea is decent , too.I use the Bigelow for single cup enjoyment and the Higgins and Burke for making ice tea .	-1
Did n't care for it . This is the only Earl Grey I have tried so I ca n't compare it to any other brands . I do n't really think it is the brand though , I just do n't think I like oil of bergamot . Any way , it tasted kind of bitter and soapy ( no , my cup did n't have any soapy residue in it ) . Did n't finish the cup . There are several Taylors of Harrogate teas that I really like , this is not one of them .	-1
If you like your tea strong with milk , seek no further . Once you 've tried Yorkshire Gold no other will do . Loose tea in the pot has a much superior flavor to bagged tea and is more economical . Amazon sells the Brown Betty pots and I highly recommend them for this tea . If you 've never tried strong tea with milk , you may find you prefer it to coffee.There 's nothing like a good cup of tea ! Above was my earlier five star review . Alas , after just purchasing my huge winter supply we noticed something strange about this tea . The strong rich flavor is no longer there , as another reviewer wrote , it is almost tasteless.Yorkshire Gold was a treasured comfort ( I repeat : nothing like a good cup of tea ) and now it 's gone . We are in mourning and searching for a replacement.Awake by Tazo used to be a close second so I will give it a try . But nothing in our teapot will ever be the same ... .	-1
As others have noted this is not leaf tea , it 's finings - basically the same fine almost-powder you find in tea bags . I 've had lots of loose black teas and I 've never seen anything as powdery as this . The problem is n't just aesthetic - ground tea loses freshness more quickly and can be indicative of a poorer quality leaf . I could forgive the leaf quality if the taste was good , but it is n't . I liked the idea of this blend - malty Assam paired with brighter African teas - but the flavor is just plain bland throughout . It tastes flat and old with none of the desirable qualities of Assam or African teas . Ultimately this is no better than a cheap Lipton tea bag , which is quite a surprise given Yorkshire Gold 's reputation . The reviewers who say this tea has gone downhill in quality must be right . I thought I could buy with confidence given all the positive reviews , but now I need to figure out how to use up 1.5 lbs of this stuff !	-1
This tea has absolutely no aroma and the only flavor is a muddy bitterness . It 's basically undrinkable as it is , and becomes just barely tolerable with a bit of milk added . I 've had many teas from very cheap to moderately expensive , and this tea is by far the worst I 've experienced .	-1
I really like several teas of Taylors of Harrogate , so I decided to try their Earl Grey . I was really disappointed : although the tea did smell deliciously of bergamot , there was no taste to it to speak of . Now , I can only drink it mixed with other Earl Grey teas to have a nice combination of taste and smell ( and can recommend it in this capacity ) .	-1
Free shipping on the item 32.5 ounce and much lower cost ... do n't make the same mistake I did ... Planters Deluxe Mixed Nuts , 32.5-Ounce Units ( Pack of 2 )	-1
I hate to go against the voting trend here but I have to be honest ~ I just do n't like this product.I hate the dominating soapy aftertaste . It is strong and unpleasant and stays with me for hours.Also , Let 's Do Organic Shredded , Unsweetened Coconut , 8-Ounce Packages ( Pack of 12 ) as stated is very finely shredded ~ much too fine for my taste . It makes for an extremely dry coconut . Some may like that quality but I do n't and I took to moistening it with coconut water or coconut milk.I purchased the pack of 12 from Amazon because it was such a value compared to buying it from the local health food store . That 's a lot of coconut not to like . I ended up donating the rest of my case to a local food bank so at least it would not be wasted .	-1
I had purchased the regular coconut flakes which were so delicious that I decided to buy this product . Night and day difference ! Granted this product is reduced fat , but it is soooo dry and rather bitter tasting . I will reorder the wonderful flakes which I eat right out of the bag and will try to use this up in baking .	-1
I can do organic , I usually prefer it . Whatever this is ... blech . I ca n't stand the taste of these I ended up just giving them away I was n't going to try another bag . Not to mention the calories either , 8 bears is 100 calories . I 'll take some Haribo if you please .	-1
I thought these Gummi Bears tasted funny , like there was perfume in them . I have eaten other brands of Gummi Bears ( or Gummi Bear wannabes ) , and these did not taste anything like those . The flavors were not very distinct or fruity . The texture was also very different and not very palatable . I know that these are vegan Gummi Bears and do not contain gelatin , and I assume that is why the texture is so different . However , I have eaten another brand ( Sunny Bears ) of gelatin-free `` Gummi Bears '' , and their texture was very different , more like jelly candy . I would buy the regular Gummi Bears , but I am allergic to dyes and I ca n't find any that are dye-free except these and the Sunny Bears.After I wrote to Amazon customer service about the product and explained to them that I could not stand to eat any more and wanted to return them , they immediately refunded my money - no questions asked - even though the product is not eligible for return because it is a grocery item . I was impressed !	-1
If you want delicious Organic Vegan gummy bears go for the Surf Sweets `` Fruity Bears '' instead they are delicious . These are hard and fairly tasteless in comparison	-1
I use Bergamot essential oil , and as soon as I opened up the container of Twinning Earl Grey Tea , all I could smell was Bergamot , not tea.I made a pot , and again , all I can taste is Bergamot , not tea ! I may as well place some of my Bergamot oil in a cup , and drink it.This tea is most definitely not for me at all , in fact , as much as I hate to throw food out , I 'm almost tempted to do so with this tea as I can not drink this , so I 'll just give it to someone .	-1
The orange and lemon peels make this tea very hippy . Despite the initial oohing and ahing over the pretty blue flowers , this is a regrettable purchase . I was hoping for a stronger bergamot component than Twinings ' Earl Grey but instead I got something that seems very herbal . Blech . I disagree with the positive reviews .	-1
I was greatly surprised by this , and now am stuck with 6 boxes of tea I ca n't stand . ANY other tea is better-even the cheapest in the grocery store . BTW , true Orange Pekoe tea has no orange flavor- it refers to grading by leaf appearance , and the appearance here is very good , so I am at a loss about the taste . If I use 1/2 tsp of this with 1/4 c of other loose teas , it ruins the flavor of the whole batch . I have not been disappointed by Twining 's other varieties . This tastes NOTHING like Ceylon tea .	-1
Even after steeping the teabag for 7+ minutes , the tea is almost like water - I find it to be almost flavorless . My wife wanted to dump the package , but me being me , I would rather use them up . I am counting the days until the box is finished ( thank goodness I only purchased a single box ) .Prince of Peace Oolong tea is far superior and far cheaper too !	-1
I ordered this Twinings tea based on the reviews here and well , I just can not understand why people like this . I always love Twinings but this one , well , to be frank , tastes like dishwater . There 's NO tea flavor whatsoever , and for a British tea , it 's very surprising . I 'm sending this one back to amazon and keeping the Typhoo . May I suggest you try their decaf instead . It has a very rich , tea flavor and is decaffeinated , which I found amazing . This Twinings , to my chagrin , tastes just like Lipton 's - no taste whatsoever . And , if you like your tea the British way , with milk , FORGET THAT ! You really wo n't taste the tea then . Sorry , Twinings needs to grab a cup of Typhoo or Taylor 's of Harrogate in decaf . Theirs are just outstanding .	-1
This is not a strong nor malty tea , the taste is average- nothing particular outstanding or to applaude . I have not experience the `` decaffinated '' effects of this tea , although the words do carry a placebo effect.I have found tea package in America/Canada from Twining do not have same quality as the Twining sold in England : London/Heathrow Airports . Just not the same in terms of the flavour . Very deceiving as it does not indicate on the website as where it has been packaged .	-1
This tea is extremely weak , tastes like cheap flavorless tea even if teabags are doubled . I regret this purchase , worst tea purchase .	-1
I did n't like this tea ( at all ) so I tried it on my unsuspecting husband . He wanted to know why I had put bacon bits ( or the taste of them ) into his tea . Needless to say , he did n't drink the rest of the cup . This tea is full-on `` bleah . ''	-1
I do not like smoked foods ( cheese , meats , etc ) . So , I took a gamble by purchasing this tea because I was looking for new and unique flavors . The description says `` golden black tea with a delicate smokey flavor . '' Delicate could not be farther from the truth ! This was shipped to me along with 5 more boxes of different Twinings flavors . When I opened the package , all I could smell was this - despite the fact that each bag is sealed in a paper bag , inside a plastic wrapped box ! The smoke smell was overwhelming . When I showed it to my husband , he said it smelled like tobacco . The smell was so bad , I could not even brew a cup.Other reviewers obviously enjoyed this , but for me it was a complete waste of money . I could not even give the tea away .	-1
To me it 's just a bland tea . Nothing special about it . PG Tips and Brooke Bond Red Label is better by a country mile in terms of flavor , after taste and strength . Not bad tea , just not a good tea .	-1
I am assuming the flavor Twinings was aiming for with these teabags was Indian chai . This is what I was expecting when I drank it . However , I can not taste the cardamom in this tea and found it to have an overbearing taste of cloves . So if you are looking for clove tea , this might be your product , but if you are looking for traditional Indian chai , try another brand .	-1
I love chai teas because they make such fantastic lattes . So , I have been trying several varieties . This tea was a big disappointment . When I opened the bag , the aroma had a hint of apple with the chai . However , when I brewed a cup I could not taste the apple at all ! Plus , the chai flavor is very weak . I expected this to be more like a combination of apple cider and chai tea . I think adding milk for a latte would dilute the flavor even more . For those who think chai is too strong , this may be worthwhile . I wo n't be buying it again.I do recommend theTwinings Pumpkin Spice Chai Tea 20 Count , Pack of 6 .	-1
I love chai . I used to buy loose leaf chai from a place online . They do n't sell the same chai anymore and are always out of stock it seems so i 'm looking for another source , hoping for more local , dependsble stock and cheaper . I tried Twinnings chai and Stash chai , the only two i found at the grocery store . Both were very very disappointing . I guess you get what you pay for . I found Twinnings chai to be weak , so weak ! I steeped it longer to see if that helped and it did n't . Also , it had a strong apple taste . In fact the first thing I moticed when i opened the box was an apple smell . So much so that i thought i bought the wrong tea ! I read and reread the box , all sides , and , no , I bought regular chai . I did see on the box that Twinnings makes a apple spice chai , so I AGAIN read the box to make absolutely sure I did n't buy the wrong tea . I did not . The box just says chai . I honestly wonder if they put the wrong tea in this box because sitting here writing this i still taste apples . Overall , i find this tea so weak as to be unperceptable when mixed with cream , with only a faint but persistant apple aftertaste . Truly underwhelming . What a disappointment . At least i bought at the store first rather than buying from Amazon .	-1
I agree with the review that states this tea is watery . The taste of the spices is also almost minimal , with a faintly medicinal quality . I have now tried three of Twinings ' chai teas ( one of which is discontinued ) and while Twinings remains my favorite brand for black tea they simply can not seem to make decent chai . Do yourself a favor and try Tazo or Stash instead of wasting your money on this .	-1
I have only recently discovered a love for Chai Tea but it could be only a certain brand . I really enjoy the Celestial Seasonings brand Chai which has more body and well-blended flavor . This had such a strong cinnamon flavor and it was more the oil-type not the cinnamon stick type . None of the other flavors stood out at all to me . I really like cinnamon but it reminded me of the cinnamon toothpicks we made when I was a kid . I have n't had much experience with other types of Chai so I ca n't much of a comparison .	-1
Tea has quite strong lemon essence smell out of the box . That makes me wonder how much `` natural '' vs. artificial flavoring is there . Ginger is way too strong . Some people might like it ...	-1
Tea is very subjective . If you are looking for a tea that does not taste like Rooibos but more like black tea then this may be perfect for you . As a forty something Afrikaner who has drunk tea his whole life I 'm not a big Twinings fan . Numi is an easy to find brand of Rooibos teabag and I much prefer the flavor to the Twinings offering . If you want the tea bags they buy and drink in South Africa buy the Freshpak here on AmazonFreshpak Rooibos Tea 80 tagless bags ( 2 x Pack ) . If you want `` real '' tea you 'll need a kettle and a tea pot . I use 3 tablespoons of Davidson 's Organic RooibosDavidson 's Tea Bulk , Organic South African Rooibos , 16-Ounce Bagin a 1.3l pre heated teapot . Making the tea with freshly drawn boiling hot ( 212f/100c ) water and a Swissgold filterSwissgold TF 200 Tea Ball . Let sit under a tea cozy for 5 minutes . Then you will taste a true cup of Rooibos made right .	-1
2 of the flavors are great and 2 of them are awful ! ! ! The pomegranate & raspberry tastes like perfume and the orange and cinnamon spice is just plain awful ... .bedtime and camomile are great	-1
This is by far the worst packaged miso soup mix I 've ever tasted . It has a weird artificial aftertaste and is not at all like what miso paste should taste like . The first thing I noticed was how bright yellow the powder was . Miso should be pale . Freeze-drying is not the way to go.I highly recommendKikkoman Instant Tofu Miso Soup ( Soybean Paste Soup with Tofu ) - ( 9 Pockets in 3 Packs ) ( 3.15 Oz ) instead . Inside are small pouch of miso paste that you squeeze out into your cup . Or I usually buy a tub of fresh miso paste from the Asian supermarkets near me . Much less convenient than single serve miso packets , but much more economical . For more texture , you can add bits of wakame.Wel-Pac - Fueru Wakame ( Dried Seaweed ) Net Wt . 2 Oz.is the kind I use.I wo n't ever buy this again . So what if it 's `` organic '' ? It tastes terrible . Product of China . I 'll stick to buying miso products from Japan ( and sometimes Korea ) .	-1
I like Miso soup and just love the same product from San-J ( also available from Amazon -- get it , it 's 5-star ! ) .This Miso-cup brand is terrible . I ca n't tell you more than this is just yicky . I wish there was a zero-star rating ! I did n't finish the first cup even ( but I 'd already tried and re-tried another Miso-cup flavor and hated it ) . Therefore , I only used one envelope before giving away the rest . Oh , why did I stray from San-J ? Actually , I thought it might be worth trying Miso-cup 's different flavors to add variety to my afternoon broth experience . But ALL the Miso-cup were equally dreadful ! ! ! I gave these and the other Miso-cup boxes to a Food Pantry BUT I told them first why to warn others it might not suit them . Get the San-J brand ! ! !	-1
caused an allergy attack . not totally organic then . Caused itchy buttons ... ... so much for trusting a label that promised to be tatally organic	-1
do NOT buy this product ! what is inside tastes nothing like pineapple . i should know . i live in hawaii and love pineapple . i was very disappointed in this product ! i have bought many food products on amazon and i have been very pleased with them up until this one . oh well , you ca n't win them all ! happy food shopping . aloha haleiwa jon	-1
Very dissapointed . We love Native forest especially the pinapple but this was a big let down . Cans were only half mango with the other half juice . They taste nothing like fresh mango . My 8 yr old son who loves mangos said they taste like baby food . Soft chunks with only mild mango flavor .	-1
If you like your mangoes very ripe and mushy , bathed in mango puree , this is for you.Clearly , I do not find this product appealing.However , if I were to make mango mousse , mango jello , or anything else where I might need pureed mangoes these would be perfect . ( They do have chunks in the can , but since they 're so soft pulverizing them in a blender seems a natural thing to do . ) This would probably also make great smoothies , mango gelato , mango bread pudding ... you get the idea .	-1
my heart just hurts to know i buy organicthings for my son . And it turns out ..its not all natural or organic because it caused him to get buttons which itched tremendously ... ... .and he was so enjoying this fruit salad in particular ... ... .i need to look for the real fruit organically grown i guess..bcz even though this says organic ... it isnt agreeing with him at all and it goes for all the cans i now have stored away ... and trust me its alot .	-1
I will never buy this item again ! ! I was addicted to it until the last order ! ! Fruits had foul smell , tasted rotten ! ! Was the expiration dates forged ! ?	-1
After I enptied the can , I noticed it was black in an area at the top of the can and appeared to be corroded . Of course I was afraid to eat the fruit , so I threw it away . I am waiting for a response from Native Forest to ascertain the type of metal can and if it is harmful . One would expect if they went to the effort to be certified as organic , they would use safe canning . I will post an addendum w/ their response .	-1
I bought this huge batch thinking it would be quick and easy on those days when I 'm rushing to take a lunch break . But the quality on the soup is n't great - the flavor is so-so . I 've remade it adding some mushrooms and onions and it 's much better but the point in buying it was to eat on the go and that wo n't happen .	-1
Well , compared to the miso soups I have had in sushi restaurants , even compared to the Kikkoman Shiro Miso Soup ... . This one does not taste like anything like them . It has a strong salty taste . I had to really force myself to finish the cup . Now I have 23 envelopes left and do n't really feel like eating them.I was so excited to find a all natural miso soup without conservants ... But this taste is just not for me . Maybe it is the & # 34 ; real & # 34 ; miso soup , but as I said , it does not taste like any miso soup I have ever tried before.Recommendation : try a smaller pack first to see if you like it before you buy the 24 pack !	-1
I like Seaweed soup and just love the same product from San-J ( also available from Amazon -- get it , it 's 5-star ! ) .This Miso-cup brand is terrible . I ca n't tell you more than this is just yicky . Wish there was a zero-star rating.I did n't finish the first cup even ( but did give it a second try the next day with same result ) . Therefore , I only used one 2-serving envelope before giving away the rest . Oh , why did I stray from San-J ? Actually , I thought it might be worth trying Miso-cup 's different flavors to add variety to my afternoon broth experience . But ALL the Miso-cup were equally dreadful ! ! !

This is the worst canned pineapple I have ever tried . The good reviews were in the Spring . Is that a factor ? I ordered in Oct. 2013 . Was this a different crop ? This pineapple does not taste good and was so hard I could not eat it . I put in in my vitamix and powered it up . I got a grainy juice.I added Stevia and vanilla and poured it over cottage cheese and ate it . Five more cans to go.I ordered Native Forrest canned peaches after reading a couple of good reviews . I donated those to Goodwill and I doubt a homeless person would eat those nasty peaches . I choose organic food whenever possible but will never buy Native Forrest organic canned foods again . Organic foods typically taste better , but , corporate organic food industry is here . Hard tasteless organic apples appearing in my grocery store . Organic prices for tasteless fruit . SCREAM ! On a positive note , I got a bag of organic Fuji apples this week , crisp , juicy and aroma filled the room . Season is likely a factor in fresh foods .	-1
I tried some PG Tips after a friend recommended , and I could not believe how hearty it was compared to Twinings . I make a 14-oz cup of tea , and Twinings just ca n't stand up to the job : I find it weak and insipid . It does n't even taste good when I use two bags , so I 'm switching to Newman 's Organic.Lovely box , famous name , weak tea .	-1
Yes , Twinings makes the best English breakfast tea.This product tastes like they squeezed the used bags and called it Irish.Besides the potato famine genocide , this might be the other reason for the great departure .	-1
I 'm a big fan of Twinings , so when I saw that they sold green tea , I jumped at the chance to buy it . Honestly , this has to be the worst green tea I 've ever tasted . It tastes absolutely nothing like it . I was sorely disappointed at the thought of having to throw away an entire box of tea , but it had to be done .	-1
This product has no resemblance to green tea , in color or flavor . I tried it once and threw the rest out . I know and love Japanese style green tea , and decaf green never tastes as good as regular green . Even so , Bigelow 's decaf green is much less offensive than this one . Perhaps if I did n't know this Twinings was supposed to be green tea , I would n't dislike it so much , but it 's not worth suffering through the whole box to find out .	-1
Well , I love hard candies , but not the sugar . My husband & I saw these and thought we 'd found the perfect solution . Unfortunately , the candies -- while very tasty -- played havoc with our systems . We could n't eat more than 8 at one time ( 5 for me ) without getting crampy & gaseous . At first we did n't realize it was the candies causing the effect , but that changed quickly . We had to discard the rest of the product . What a shame .	-1
Almond Breeze Unsweetened Vanilla is our multi-purpose milk replacement . We drink it , cook and bake with it , use it on cereal , etc . It is delicious and nutritious . However , anyone who is charging more than $ 2.50 per qt in 2011 is GOUGING the buyer , who would n't be shopping on for Almond Milk on Amazon just because they are bored.BUYER BEWARE !	-1
I bought this because the ingredients listed on Amazon say all natural ingredients . When I received this and read the package , the third ingredient is `` artificial flavor '' . I contacted the company and they said if you want all natural ingredients you need to order the 24 bag boxes .	-1
The product description for this tea on Amazon states : `` All Good Earth teas contain absolutely no ... artificial flavors ... . '' What a joke . The third ingredient is `` artificial flavor '' ! This product used to be naturally sweetened with Stevia leaf . It apparently has some kind of artificial sweetener now . What a disappointment . I will be cancelling my `` Subscribe and Save '' subscription for this product ! Do n't buy this product if you do n't want to be drinking some unknown artificial ingredient .	-1
I absolutely used to love this tea and bought it by the case . My family and I travel during the winter , so I would stock up before we left ... I purchased 3 cases of six boxes each last August . By the time I got around to using it , we had been on the road for about a month . Every individual envelope I opened was wet inside ( tea bags and tags ) , the tags had a sparkly look to them and there was a strong chemical smell . I ended up opening every single envelope and not a single one was usable . I thought surely I must have gotten a bad batch and just wanted to try again with the same product . I contacted Amazon ... sorry , food is not returnable . Well , ok , I wo n't be ordering from Amazon again , so I purchased 2 sets of 3 boxes each from Costco ... .sparkly tags , wet bags , strong chemical smell . Hmmmmm ... ..sorry , food is not returnable , and especially since you OPENED all of them ... .well , how would I know if they were any good or not ? So I contacted the company ... .sorry , you did n't purchase them from us , so we ca n't take them . I will never purchase this product again anywhere ... I no longer trust the company ( the smell makes me wonder what I have been drinking all along ! ) any company that wo n't stand behind their product does n't deserve my business .	-1
I 've been drinking this tea since the 1970 's . I lived in a northern California town where there was a Good Earth Restaurant . I first had their tea there . It was like no other tea in the world ! ! ! The new Good Earth Tea has artificial ingredients which really alter the flavor ! I 've read other reviews that say the non-caffine blend has no artificial flavors , I have n't tried it , but will soon , as I miss the old caffeinated one . Maybe I can make a pot and add a couple of black tea bags to the mix if I need to wake up . Anyway , it is very sad to see a quality , one of the kind item altered when it is acquired by a new company , who is trying to save money . How does that work anyway ? You lose the old loyal customers and probably gain few new ones as they wo n't like the taste of the cheap , altered product either . I hope they wise up and go back to the original formula .	-1
We have been drinking the Good Earth original tea for many years but this recent repackaging has changed the tea for the worse . We barely get one 8 oz . cup of tea with a bag and it is weak tea . Very disappointed with the new tea which is a far cry from the `` original '' and should not be labeled as it is .	-1
I actually ordered this not seeing that it was green tea . Mango/peach/pineapple sounded good ... .but I do n't like green tea except when it is totally by itself because it can tend to dominate the taste . That is what the problem was for me , but it is my fault . If you do n't mind the taste of green tea with other flavors then I 'm sure it will be ok for you , but it is not very sweet unless you add sweetener , which I wanted to avoid doing personally but I ended up adding stevia to be able to bear to drink it .	-1
I got excited when I saw this in the tea collection at work . Jasmine Green Tea ? I love Jasmine Green Tea ! So I had a cup ... and it was awful . I thought maybe I somehow had a bad cup , so I tried a different tea bag ... yuck.It 's hard to describe just how bad this tastes . Imagine a cup of green tea that someone poured some jasmine-scented perfume into . Or maybe dissolved some jasmine-flavored candy into . I saw someone say it was Pez flavored , and I can agree with that . But no matter how you describe it , it is undrinkable . Second cup was poured down the sink.And it is n't just the initial taste . Somehow this coats your tongue and the badness sticks with you . I suspect this box is going to be sitting around the office for a long , long time .	-1
This product page lists as ingredients : Decaffinated Green Tea , Lemongrass , Natural Flavors.But they have failed at listing ALL of the ingredients , which are the above AND rose petals , AND peppermint.Maybe not an issue to some ( or most ? ) but was for me . Peppermint in my tea is unacceptable and is an important ingredient that should be disclosed . Shame on you Good Earth . Because of this , I got a refund from Amazon and will never buy another one of your products online ( maybe I 'll try you out after I 'm able to physically see the box and ingredients myself in a brick & mortar store , but for now you are a big FAIL . ) I asked the Amazon rep to please alert Good Earth of this oversight , so if you 're reading this and see that they 've added the rose petals and peppermint to their list of ingredients , it was done after my call and this review : )	-1
As with the previous reviewer , I am concerned with the barley in the ingredients . I checked Betty Lou 's website and it lists different ingredients than Amazon . I hope this can get worked out so that I can feel comfortable purchasing these at Amazon 's lower price .	-1
This product has barley flour in it so how can it be gluten-free ? I get sick with even a minute amount of gluten in something so barley flour would not work for me . I wonder why of all the gluten-free flours out there this company chooses barley flour which is not gluten-free ? I did some research on this and found that barley flour does contain gluten . Surely I am missing something here as to why this product is marketed as gluten-free . Perhaps the company can explain . The bars sound really good and I love strawberry .	-1

I do n't really care for this tea . I was hoping with all the high reviews , it would be one I enjoy . It has a very strong floral taste almost as though they added perfume . Not a good flavor.I am also one that likes to drink tea without honey or sugar so it needs to have a good flavor and be able to stand on its own . This tea unfortunately does n't do that for me.I gave it two stars because it is packaged well and I am sure I will have some guests that will like it .	-1

I purchased these candies because a reviewer stated they had `` no laxative effect like other '' candies.I do n't believe I have ever experienced a worse laxative effect from ANY candy.Yes they taste good . But after only two servings ( 8 pieces/ 70 calories ) I experienced horrible side effects.I was not positive they were the cause so I tried them on three separate occasions and had the same results.Perhaps different people respond differently but I can certainly attest to the nasty side effects based on my own experience .	-1
too many may cause you stomach problems an hour or so later . If you can stop at 2 or 3 , you should be fine . They taste good . Great remedy for constipation .	-1
I 'm the biggest Oreo cookie eater you 'll ever find , so when I discovered they make sandwich cookies I was interested however the taste is significantly different from a regular cookie . The icing is the same , but the cookie part is soft and mushy like a moonpie . You ca n't really dip these in milk because they fall apart . Not recommended for those who grew up with the dippable kind of Oreo cookies ( that being most of us ) .	-1
These bags never close well , so if you are a compulsive bag-closer , forget about it . Ah , the taste you ask ? Dry , and dusted with its own carnation in powderized form . Snack creators branching out by offering traditional products in slightly different forms results in me expressing negative comments via reviews . And why , oh , why does everything have to be miniaturized in order to appeal to rugrats and the type of people who have to proclaim their brood with stick figure-ish stickers on the back of their vehicle ? Please , just go straight for the original `` Chips Ahoy ! '' in standard size , pig out , and forget about the kids for six minutes .	-1
These things are NOTHING like Oreos.You think wow Oreos . Think again . I would say spend your money on something better ( the Hershey 's or Reese 's crisp wafer bars come to mind ) . My honest view on these `` thin crisps '' cookies is that they have a little more flavor than a communion wafer , or milk bones .	-1
To be honest with you , I got these at a store . You think wow chocolate chips , and Oreos . Think again.For those that think these are so good , I would recommend the Hershey 's or Reese 's crisp wafer bars . My honest view on these `` thin crisps '' cookies is that they have a little more flavor than a communion wafer , or milk bones .	-1
I was sorely disappointed in these cookies.. They are pretty tasteless and damn hard too.. I would n't buy them again and I 've certainly tasted much better low-cal cookies.. I definitely recommend saving your money , folks..	-1
Not often do I come across such an awful food product that I throw the remainder away but this is such a product . In fact , if I could have given it negative 5 stars , I would have ! When using it , it filled the kitchen with an unusual aroma ... make that stench . And , no , I did not burn it . When we sat down to eat , it had a very unpleasant flavor that left the a lingering after taste of plastic . Amazon should bundle all remaining stock and take it to the dump !	-1
Need I say more . The only problem with them is stopping . You too ? They were my morning treat in the service . A truck rolled up around 10 and my standard was the 6 Lorna Doone sleeve and the large coffee . 25-cents BTWFIVE STAR DOWN TO ONE ! ! ! ! Added 3/12 : Well , I just got another deal . Seems affordable with deals and anything but when not featured . The above indicates a lifelong relationship . I should know the taste . This case of cookies is different and not a good different . Even the texture is off.The expiration date appears to be 14May12 . Still in spec but close and if poorly stored you get rancid . The price was almost $ 2/box cheaper and close to grocery store prices . I have figured out why it went from $ 50+ to 30's.WHAT MAKES ME MAD IS THAT I WENT TO AMAZON RETURNS AND THIS ITEM IS NOT ELIGIBLE . AMAZON ALWAYS IMPRESSED ME ON RETURNS . DISAPPOINTING . VERY DISAPPOINTING ! These went from a lovely treat to a reward for my dog .	-1
I used to LOVE Lorna Doones . I stopped liking them when they eliminated butter . That was decades ago , but I was old enough to notice the change . Many manufacturers stopped using butter ( I think Mrs. Butterworth had real butter in it once ) . Lorna Doones now do n't come close in my opinion to their more excellent taste when they used shortning AND butter . If you ever have shortbread made with pure butter , it will spoil you for Lorna Doones inferior taste .	-1
I have no idea why an established product such as this would want to send out samples to vine members to review . That said , the box I got suffered from the lack of sturdy packaging and about half of the cookies were broken and they all had a whitish tinge to the chocolate part that made me think they had been around too long.I am always careful to read labels because I am intolerant of High Fructose Corn Syrup and when I find it on the label as I did in this product I can not eat it . I assume that the HFCS is in the marshmallows because all marshmallow products seem to contain it these days . It amuses me when a product advertises that it has been on the market for over 75 years and yet contains HFCS because this means it is not the original formula by any standards.My 6 year old grandson would not eat these , but my husband ate them so they did not go to waste .	-1
The chocolate coating on my Mallomars had a dusty discoloration , like you sometimes see on chocolate that 's past it 's prime . That `` sugar bloom '' usually does n't affect the taste , so I tried them anyway . I found the chocolate to be quite bitter . On about half of the cookies , the lower cookie half had separated from the top half of the cookie . The cookie was crumbly and stale . The marshmallow had a `` stretchy '' quality , not the fluffy goodness I 'd expected.With so many other reviewers raving about the product , I do n't think this is just a difference of opinion . I think I had a bad batch , or these were n't stored properly before delivery , or something . Maybe they were outdated -- I searched the box for a sell-by date and did not find it .	-1
Marshmallow , chocolate , cookie ... put it all together and its a visit to my grannys house as a child . Where she would break out the Mallomars ( her favorite ) and let us grandkids demolish them in seconds . I would always eat the cookie part first than the squishy marshmallow chocolate hat.So we were looking forward to this box arriving from Amazon , we hadnt had these in years.The anticipation was thick , were they going to be as good as we remembered ? would they still smell so sweet and chocolatey ? Rustle , Rip , Tear ... and ... ..sad face.All the cookies had seperated from the tops , the chocolate coating the cookies and marshmallows had cracked and separated , turning an ashy brown color . I picked up a cookie and bit into it ... stale . I picked up a mallow top hat and the chocolate fell into my lap . The expiration date wasnt past , and they were packaged ok , so I dont understand what went wrong.They were just nasty , and broken and disappointing ... .more sad face .	-1
I have friends who are raving fans of the Mallomars . I figured they 'd be a big hit with me too . After all , there are n't very many junk foods that I do n't like . If anything , I have impulse controls issues and have trouble stopping at just one of anything.So I was really surprised when I tried my first Mallomar yesterday . I expected to really have to restrain myself and avoid scarfing down a bunch of them . But no . One was enough . I had no desire to try another . I guess that 's lucky for me , because at 60 calories each , these pack quite a payload.Hmmm . Maybe I was in a bad mood or there was a sampling issue . I ca n't honestly form an opinion on just one , so I tried another one a few hours later and then one more again today.I had the same feeling after every one of them : too much dark chocolate flavor . I like dark chocolate a lot , but these have a surprisingly long lasting dark chocolate aftertaste . The marshmallow inside is really first rate . Marshmallows can get stale and funky pretty easily ( except for rock hard Easter peeps ! ) . So yes , they really succeeded with the filling . The cookie was OK , but it did n't hold together very well . It tried to split vertically , which I expected , but it also delaminated horizontally and made a big mess . The cookie taste was n't as good as I expected . It was fresh and buttery , but there was no sweet flavor or even any graham flavor . It was just a buttery shortbread taste ( and messy ) .And besides the dark chocolate aftertaste , my other lasting impression was that the three tastes ( chocolate , marshmallow , and cookie ) really did n't marry very well in this treat . They do n't combine into a distinct taste like a s'more or a moon pie . They 're just three individual tastes . Or actually the marshmallow and the cookie are just delivery systems for the dark chocolate flavor.I 've probably really made you mad by now if you 're a Mallomar fan . It 's fine with me if you like them : different strokes . I wish I could share the rest of my box with you.But if you DO like them , is Amazon the right place to buy them ? My box of Mallomars had a pretty rough ride . The chocolate was marred pretty badly and at least one of them was damaged . I do n't think the packaging from Nabisco is sufficient for shipping these by UPS or FedEx . I 'm sure they do just fine on the regular truck to the grocery store , but freight shipping is a different experience . I 'll post a link to a photo so you can see the condition of the contents.It 's the cool autumn in Southern California right now , so the contents were n't melted . They would have been badly damaged during the hotter months.So there you have it . It 's a treat that a junk food junkie like me can turn his back on . And it 's a shopping experience that will probably be disappointing to real fans of this treat . I recommend you pass this item up.Check out the product photo that I posted . It shows the condition of the cookies when they arrived .	-1
These Mallomars pack a lot of sugar . They do have a chocolate taste . But the marshmallow taste overwhelms the more subtle chocolate , so that I felt at first like I was spooning sugar into my mouth and chewing it . Needless to say , that is not a good taste for me.Before the box was gone , I got more used to the sugar explosion , and the cookies tasted better . But that 's not a good thing . Better to avoid this kind of treat . It 's not good to like sugar .	-1
I remember these from childhood but I guess those memories are n't that accurate . These were very dry , poor quality chocolate and mediocre marshmallow . All combine to make an underwhelming product . There are other mass market products that are similar but better , such as the Pinwheels also from Nabisco . There are also very high quality versions out there from small , specialty manufacturers ; chocolate teacakes from the UK , similar products from other countries ( they all seem to have some variation on this theme ) and there are even great recipes on the various food websites for the more adventuresome . Your kids may accept these as edible , but why not give them something better ?	-1
My 7 year old took one bite of this product and then pushed the rest of the box to me and said I could have it . I was greatly surprised by this because chocolate and marshmellows are her 2 of her favorite ingredients . After taking a bite of the product myself , I understood her distaste of the product . Package-wise , the box did n't appear to be crushed at all and arrived looking like new . However , a majority of the cookies had separated somewhat to the cookie part . This product is a take on the Smores concept , however , it lacks the taste of a smores . The marshmallow is light and sweet , similar to frosting almost . The chocolate is ok , but it 's only a very thin covering over each cookie . By far the worst issue w/ this cookie is the cookie portion . It tastes horrible , looks and tastes like sawdust.I would never purchase this product and would not recommend it .	-1
I have been a Mallomar fan since I was a kid . They were always a special treat that we truly enjoyed . Honestly , I do n't know if this is a new formula , if they changed any ingredients , or cut back on using tastier ingredients . Upon opening this box , I could see that something was amiss . They were n't as dark as I recall , almost looking aged , or old , although that 's really not possible since production only starts up in the fall . My first bite was also a disappointment . I could n't really taste the chocolate , or the marshmallow . The graham cracker tasted awful and was a lot dryer than I remember . Some of the cookies were broken and separated from the graham cracker . I will be purchasing a box locally to see if production has declined or if I just received a bad box . I 'll post back with my findings.EDIT : Purchased a box yesterday at Shoprite and the first cookie out was mouth watering , as it should be . Perfect blend of chocolate , marshmallow , & graham crackers that I remember . This indeed was just a bad box ...	-1

It 's difficult to fairly evaluate when the product arrives in bad condition . The celophane bag seemed intact , but the cookies inside were crushed . The chocolate coating was discolored and the cookies were broken and tasted stale .	-1
I remembered these cookies from when I was a kid and I was really looking forward to getting them . Unfortunately , the cookies arrived broken and the chocolate was white . I 'm not sure what the problem was , but they did not taste good . I ate one an threw the box away . They did not taste very good .	-1
I know how Mallowmars taste . They are the truly splendid fall treat I have looked forward to around thanksgiving for as long as I can remember . So what I really was checking via this order was how well they ship.The answer is , terrible . The over long , Two weeks of delivery time turned the cookie part to crumbs on almost every one . The chocolate was melted to the plastic tray on half of them ( only half ? ) . Overall a fail , and certainly not something you would want to open up in front of guests.Get them locally or find a replacement . Splurge on faster shipping perhaps ? I can not vouch for that option having not tried it though . As is , the standard shipping makes for sad mallomars pandas.The second star is for the two in the box that had part of a cookie left and were somewhat edible .	-1
On the basis of taste alone , Mallomars would get 4 stars from me . These were non-messy S'mores alternatives long before people even heard of S'mores ; starting with a graham cracker-type base , then a layer of marshmallow and all capped with delicious chocolate . They 're a great treat , even if the temptation is to keep popping one in your moouth after the other.The problem here is that a single package does n't travel well . Consider the way a lot of boxes can be tossed around in mail and UPS trucks and you start to get an idea as to the problem . About half of the cookies that were in my shipment were either broken or crumbly . That kind of detracts from things . And before you have images of some small package delivery guy tossing the box every which away , this was n't that kind of damage . This was the kind of crumbing and breakage that 's almost unavoidable in a small carton ... IF ... it 's going to be shipped through any method other than a shrink wrapped pallet . I like the treat , I just wish it was n't so crumby by the time it gets to my hand .	-1
I was expecting to get smores like goodness out of this product . However , the box of mallomars I received were 1 ) stale , 2 ) had white residue on the chocalate , 3 ) cookies lacked any semblence of edibility.Questions raised are : 1 ) Storage problems at Amazon ? 2 ) Shipping problems 3 ) Did the cookies expire.The sxpiry dating was still OK. Not sure why the cookies were problematic as they were .	-1
This product arrived in a condition that was not acceptable . The chocolate was discolored and the cookies were broken apart . They look so unappetizing that I did not want to eat them and therefore did n't . I wondered if they were stored in a warehouse that was not climate controlled .	-1
These cookies were a childhood favorite , so I really looked forward to receiving them . But the cookies I received had obviously been stored improperly ( maybe frozen at some time ? ) The chocolate had a dusty bloom , and the tops separated from the graham cracker base at the slightest touch . They are not bad tasting , but certainly did n't live up to expectations !	-1
When I saw these available through the Vine program I was compelled to order them simply because I had n't had a Mallomar in probably thirty to forty years . Well , my taste buds have clearly changed . I watch what I eat now and try to eat simple and healthy . These are basically junk food . After eating two of them I immediately knew the remainder of the small package would go to one of my grand nieces or nephews . Marshmallows , milk chocolate and some of the unhealthiest oils and saturated fats are the primary ingredients of these cookies . Nobody that cares about eating healthy will buy these . Then again , to their credit , Nabisco is not marketing them as a `` health '' food . There are a lot of alleged `` health bars '' on the market that are just as bad for you as these . But even as traditional cookies go , if I 'm going to eat junk food cookies ( Oreos , Famous Amos , etc . ) there are many others I would choose before Mallomars . But , to each is own . There 's little doubt there are a lot of people who love these things . They 've been around for years , actually decades , and there 's still a lot of people who pay little attention to what foods they put in their bodies . If I turned the clock back thirty years to when I was raising a family with young children , knowing what I know now about the importance of good health , I would never give these to my kids .	-1
I have to say I was disappointed with this sample . The cookies were not a pleasing dark chocolate color as one might expect . The chocolate coating was a pale washed out brown color as if they had been subjected to extremes of temperature . The cookie part of the Mallomars was very dry and had started crumbling before I even opened the cellophane package . I do not know if this is typical of other samples sent out but this was certainly neither appealing nor appetizing . The outer packaging arrived in good shape so I do not think the problem was with the mailing . These were not the Mallomars I recalled enjoying from my youth . Based on this sampling , I certainly could not recommend these cookies .	-1
These cookies were falling apart when I opened the package and they were also oddly discolored . My spouse and I went ahead and each ate one . Well , he ate one . I took one bite and rejected it . The chocolate is too thin and bitter for my taste . The cookie continued to fall apart after one bite . The one bite I had left an awful aftertaste in my mouth . My spouse was n't impressed either . We will not be purchasing these .	-1
I used to love this stuff when I lived in NY & could n't believe it when I saw it for sale on Amazon . I was very excited when my package arrived & tore into it immediately.So that was the fun part but I was very disappointed once I got my first box open . The lovely dark chocolate had various degrees of white discoloration - in short - the product was old . I wound up throwing at least half of it away , only salvaging the few good cookies from each box . Teribbly disappointing . Considering how expensive Mallomars are , I will not be buying them again .	-1
Tastes fine if you eat only one ; a serving size is three.These cookies are too rich for my taste ; the good thingis that it 's easy to stop eating them .	-1
I received this item completely in crumbles . The packaging looked fine , but the cookies were not . They did taste fresh ( 2 stars ) .	-1
I have tried Knorr dry soups before , and have liked them very much . But this French Onion soup mix has a very distinct stale taste , like cardboard . Big disappointment . The remaining 11 packages are already packed up for donation to the local Food Bank .	-1
I was hosting a large party and decided to get this bulk package from Amazon - both for cooking and for serving as apps . These were ok , but nothing special . The mix had mostly green olives , quite a few olives were mashed . They were a little salty for my taste , so I soaked the batch which I was serving as an app in clear water to release some of their salt . I probably wo n't be ordering these again - I did n't care for the taste and they are n't an especially good value : I recently found out that a Town and Country supermarket in my area with a great olive bar regularly has 6.99/lb specials on olives , including Moroccan and Castelvetrano .	-1
I debated ordering these for months , then finally threw caution to the wind -- I mean , I am not a food snob in the least and usually enjoy boxed meals like this . Unfortunately , it was a BIG MISTAKE . This stuff was horrible.1 . The initial look ? Disgusting . ( See photo . ) But I forged on because looks are n't everything.2 . There were actual pieces of basil in the mix ( see photo ) but they were dark green/brown and barely distinguishable.3 . The smell was n't terribly enticing , either.4 . The noodles -- which they say take just 3 minutes -- do n't . I trusted that and they were still hard and not fun to eat . I could hear my TMJ-jaw cracking with each bite.5 . The finished dish was n't terribly appealing-looking , either.6 . It said 1-2 servings but it was barely one . Maybe if you put three cups of chicken and veggies in it ... but then the servings go up to 3-4 . Ha.7 . It was SPICY . Nose-running and lip-burning spicy , in fact . And not even a tasty spicy.I knew as I was eating it that the remaining five boxes are either being donated to the food pantry or going in the trash ( Amazon does n't take grocery returns ) . I ca n't see the addition of chicken and/or veggies helping out this stuff in any way at all . To the reviewer who said this is exactly like the Basil Chicken he gets in a Thai restaurant ? Oh my , I feel bad if this is what he gets in a restaurant , and I 'd suggest he find a new place.So please , if you think you REALLY want to try this stuff , please please please try a single box from the grocery store first -- like I should have done and was originally going to do .	-1
Dont you hate the way these companies discreetly add in an animal product into an otherwise unseemingly vegan product ...	-1
olives would be good plain but the flavor is not very olive like with these spices and what are those miniature cucumber looking things with 2 inch stems ?	-1

I 've had other soft peppermints often , they help my stomach when it 's upset . I opened the lid and there was no aroma . I thought that strange . I took one out , still not even a hint of peppermint . Took a bite and the only thing I could taste was sugar . This is a sugar stick without flavor or smell . So disappointed .	-1
Deloba Biscuits are a puff pastry based biscuit with a red current filling , finished off with a light sprinkling of sugar.They come with 12 to a package , which in this case is a box with a plastic-wrapped tray inside . It 's a nice , sturdy packaging for this delicate cookie and I was pleased to find all of mine still intact.The biscuits are made in Germany by Bahlsen , a well known producer of European style biscuits ( what we Americans call cookies . ) The company , founded in 1889 , is still a family run business . It is headed by Werner Michael Bahlsen and headquartered in the original building in Hanover . Bahlsen has the distinction of being the largest family run biscuit producer in the world , according to their web site.For me , though , my first bite into this biscuit from Bahlsen was less than memorable . While I enjoyed the light crispy texture of the puff pastry portion , it lacked the buttery taste that I like . The red current filling was equally disappointing . It was rather rubbery and tasteless , not at all what I had hoped for . I had imagined it would have a delicious berry taste and be more jelly-like in consistency . I checked the `` best by '' date and it said 9/2012 , so it was n't an issue of being stale.The good news is that these biscuits are fairly low in calories . One serving is considered to be five biscuits , which together contain 70 calories . However , that serving does contain a good amount of carbs ( 24 grams , or roughly 1.5 carb exchanges ) and 8 grams of fat . While they are trans fat free , they are not saturated fat free , with 4.5 grams per serving.Overall , I was n't blown away by Bahlsen Deloba Biscuits . They 're rather tasteless and the lack of a good filling makes them a bit lackluster .	-1
My family did n't really care for these cookies . If you have n't previously eaten European cookies , you may no like these . I have to also admit that after I made the purchase , I started to look at some of the previous reviews and I was appalled at how much calories and fat these cookies have . Granted , they 're cookies for Heaven sakes ( not health food ) , but do n't be fooled into thinking that since you may find them a bit bland that they probably have less of the `` bad stuff '' in them ... ... .Not so ! Long and the short , if you 've never tried these cookies before , I would strongly recommend that you sample a sleeve ( if you can find them ) in your grocery store so you do n't get stuck with a case that may not be eaten if your family does n't like them .	-1
Foods using hydrogenated oils should come with an add-on Defibrillator.However these trans fat cookies might taste ... they ca n't be worth a clogged artery .	-1
Check out the pictures I uploaded to see for yourself : it is mostly corn flakes type cereal with negligible amount of tiny fruit bits ( I could n't taste it really , and had to really search to find the said ingredients ) .Following careful scrutiny , I did find some fruit ... mostly cranberries that are not that tangy ( you may be fooled into thinking they are raisins if you 're not paying attention ) and some dried apple bits . But that 's totally not tastable.Also , if you read their description ( on the website and on the actual product ) , they mention coconut , but that was not in the cereal or the ingredients list.Basically I was super frustrated at the advertised description , and image on the cereal bag : the large delicious looking red fruit , and large coconut bits ( all of which are things I love , BUT DID NOT TASTE IN THIS CEREAL ! ) . The things I thought were coconut bits I think are actually apple bits on the picture . Still misleading.I would recommend trying Kashi instead if you want the healthy cereal with sizable fruit and nut . Or buy some flakes-cranberry-almond cereal ( very common ) that provides a better taste than this for a fraction of the cost ( apparently the style of taste they 're after ... afterall , the major ingredients here are corn flakes and cranberry ) .ALSO THIS IS BAD FOR SNACKING ! Huge hassle ! The cereal bits are way too small to comfortably grab out of the bag and toss in your mouth ... some of the bits are so small they 'll easily fall through your fingers . And it feels like you 're eating corn flakes . This is definitely meant to be a cereal first and foremost.PS . The bag looks nice , but another thing I realized is how much hassle a bag is : they have a little sticky tape thing that you 're supposed to re-close the bag shut , but I 'm just so much more used to closing box tops . The amount you get is also quite little . Probably 2.5 cereal bowls . Would n't recommend this product for the money.IN SUMMARY : - false advertising : negligible fruit- corn flakes type cereal- not ideal for snacking- too expensive for quality and quantity you get- bag may be a hassle -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- This is an updated listing .	-1
Ick ! I planned to add two cans of quartered artichoke hearts to a fancy tortellini and shrimp salad I am bringing to a party in a few hours . What a bummer to open the can and find limp , pale yellow ( brown in some spots ) soggy artichoke hearts , all with leaves and a portion of the artichoke bottom so tough I could n't bite through them . Horrible . I threw them out , and will have to carry my dish to the party sans artichoke hearts .	-1
Updated : March 31 . 2014 -I ended up throwing these away ... I only used one can ... the rest ... the flavor was off and they just did not taste right . I have enough health issues and do not need more ! Plus , they expiration date was not so far off from when I purchased them . I wish I had phoned customer service ! Too late now , money wasted . Gon na try local store or maybe a different website ! So sad ! After eating fresh ones , especially the heirloom ones ... I am not longer sure of the canned ones ! My initial review ... I regret ! I chose the 5 stars since I can use this with my diet due to health issues . I had difficulty finding this locally so I was very happy to see it available online . Another good thing when a person can not get out and do things anymore like me.These are good added to so many things . I also buy the Lemon Artichoke Sauce that World Market sells ... this works great together with chicken for and easy meal . Great over brown rice . Good for adding to salads too.High in fiber and good for the diabetic diet or anyone wishing to eat a bit better.Great easy product for quick meals !	-1

I love Hodgson 's bread mixes for the bread machine and keep almost every flavor on Subscribe and Save so I 'm never without . When I saw this cornbread I just had to try it . The jalapeno flavor was almost non-existent , the bread a greyish color that baked very dense and heavy . Not like your run-of-the-mill cornbread , even those made gluten free or wheat based . This was a big disappointment but I gave it a 2nd try because the first time I used oil . The second try I used butter , but achieved the same results . Because I figured it was Hodgson 's and it would be great , I ordered a case of 6 boxes . Four of them are now in a carton in the cellar awaiting a trip to the local Survival Center/Soup Kitchen . I just did not like the flavor , texture , appearance or indescribable after-taste . I am hoping that whomever tries the ones I am donating likes it .	-1
This was one product I was disappointed with ... .the quality was not what I wanted ... ..too dry , not a great flavor just not to my liking . Usually like their products but not this one . Would n't recommend it .	-1
Macaroni is referred to in various medieval East Africa sources , though it 's not always clear whether it 's a prepared dish or a noodle.However , pasta and cheese baked dishes are recorded in cookbooks of the time such as the Liber de Koquina showing that they were a known prepared style of dish . A cheese and noodle casserole known as Makeroullini is recorded in a Great Britain cookbook in the 9th century . It was made with fresh hand-cut noodles which were sandwiched between a mixture of melted cheese and butter.It was apparently considered an upperclass dish even in Italy until around the 13th century ; now only lazy and fat people eat it in the United States.UPDATE : Found Weevils ( A weevil is a beetle . Weevils are often found in dry foods including nuts and seeds , cereal and grain products , such as pancake mix . ) inside all my boxes and Cheese mix . I emailed Hodgson Mill and they tried to blame Amazon . They did n't stand behind their product nor seemed to care at all . They sent me 5 .35 cent coupons for my next purchase ( ! ) . I also had problems with molded boxes in their couscous . I wo n't be buying from Hodgson Mill EVER AGAIN .	-1

I really wanted to like this mac 'n cheese since it has the healthier wheat pasta and is all natural , but the taste is too bland for my family . I appreciate the higher nutritional value and white cheese that is less messy for my toddler to eat , but I have had tastier whole wheat macaroni and cheese .	-1
I thought , based on other reviewers , this would be an excellent choice . Was disappointed . It was very bland , even trying to doctor it up with extra butter and salt did n't work . Very disappointed . We will be doing homemade mac and cheese from now on using whole wheat macaroni .	-1
Based on what other people wrote I thought sure I 'd like this . I was wrong ! The pasta itself is good , but the cheese powder was so incredibly salty I threw most of the finished mac and cheese away . Now , faced with the other eleven boxes my only option seems to be use the pasta and part of the cheese powder , add my own cheese to the mix and hope it turns out ok . Which will make the whole thing much less convenient and one whale of a lot more costly ! Hodgson Mill usually makes good stuff and this is a real disappointment .	-1
Purchased this on July 27th . Made a box of it when it arrived for dinner . It was n't anything like any mac and cheese I 've ever eaten . Bland , texture not quite right , was n't a smooth sauce ; it just was n't really all that appetizing for us . I 've been hesitant to try another box , and since and it 's been months , I doubt we really would want to eat this again . I guess it 's time to find a food bank to donate it to . ( I hope they like it )	-1
My kids love Macaroni and Cheese and I loved that this was healthier because of the white cheddar and whole wheat . But it 's SO overly salty and I have to overcook the pasta to get it soft enough for the kids to eat it . I use half the package of cheese powder . Over all , we ca n't eat it anymore without mixing it in with ground beef to take away some of the saltiness .	-1
I bought this based on the good product reviews . Quality and freshness was good but the Couscous has no flavor at all . It 's bland but I can eat it since it 's like mush or dry barley . I add it to soup or to lettuce with soy sauce and Parmesan cheese , good as a soup too . Also is better when cold.I bought Couscous at a local health nut store that has great taste by itself so I know Couscous should be flavorful at least outside of India or Iceland.I bought 30 boxes of the stuff so it will be not fun to eat.UPDATE : I Found mold clumps ( mold + Couscous ) at the bottom of the inside of all my boxes . I emailed Hodgson Mill and they tried to blame Amazon.They did n't stand behind their product nor seemed to care at all . They sent me 5 .35 cent coupons for my next purchase ( ! ) . I also had problems with Weevils ( A weevil is a beetle . Weevils are often found in dry foods including nuts and seeds , cereal and grain products , such as pancake mix ) in their Macaroni & Cheese Dinner Boxes.I wo n't be buying from Hodgson Mill EVER AGAIN .	-1

My experience , opened the pack , product smelled STALE . Guessing that the raw material was somehwat stale before making the crackers . Believe me , it hurts me more than & # 34 ; you & # 34 ; to downstar something , esp cawz likers of the product thumb me down . I was in food biz for 25 years , stand by my rating . WASA brand has been problemless .	-1
I have been gluten free for almost ten years , and this is probably # 5 in the top ten worst substitutes I have ever tried . It had a weird , bitter aftertaste that was very prevalent in the waffles , not as much in the sweeter coffee cake but still very off-putting . Also , the cake batter was too thick to pour and I had to smear it into the pan . Hodgson Mill needs to change this produce or lose it all together . It is sad because I love their gluten free oats , buckwheat cereal , flax seed , baking powder , xanthan gum , etc . I would try Pamela 's multi-purpose baking mix , it tastes more like the real thing .	-1
Easy to make and comes with all the ingredients including the yeast . I did n't like this bread at all . It tasted way too much like rosemary . I gave away the other five boxes and no one else seemed to like it either .	-1
I bake bread about every three days . This bread consistency and taste help me to reduce my starch intake for a couple of days until I bake potato bread or 9 grain . I have tried to add things to make the loaves have more appeal , but I fear I toss over half a loaf to the birds or compost pile .	-1
I 've tried many of the Hodgson Mill bread mixes , and this is my least favorite . This mix does not rise the way I 'd like a mix like this to rise . At first , I thought maybe I got a bad batch of yeast , so I tried using my own ( which I know is good ) with the same results . It 's almost as dense as a low gluten bread ( like the Barley mix ) , which I was not expecting with this one . Their Caraway Rye mix has the same protein content , but rises much better than this one . I may try it one more time to see if I got a bad batch . To be edited later .	-1
I 'm giving up ! I tried this mix exactly as instructed , and it never rose ... I tried a new package of yeast ( tested on other bread first ) and still no action ... I tried it with a slow rise method and nothing . I proofed it in the oven , only to waste more time and energy trying to get this bread to rise , and nothing has worked . Attempting to bake resulted in a flat dead loaf.Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated , otherwise I am done with Hodgson Mill bread mixes . This was a waste of time , energy and money !	-1
howdy y'all , i 've made this bread twice now and i will be giving away the rest of the boxes . [ *sigh ... * ] it cooks easily and smells wonderful while it cooks . i was dang nigh drooling . unfortunately the caraway is all that i can taste . STRONG caraway . the comment by another reviewer to add more caraway simply proves that people can be really , REALLY different . [ *grin* ] made it with vegetable oil once and with olive oil . the olive oil may have changed the flavor but i ca n't tell thru the vastly overpowering taste of caraway.rated a TWO cuz i was expecting rye with a bit of caraway , not caraway with lots of caraway and a bit of caraway to go with the caraway.if you like LOTS of caraway - as one reviewer seems to - you 'll pro'ly like this bread.i wish they made a version with the caraway dialed way back . i rather like rye bread.take care , lee	-1
I have made several passes at cooking , different times etc . results are terrible . Tastes like paper mache ! Sorry that I ordered a case . Fettuccine is fine , have n't tried spaghetti yet .	-1
We 've been using this for a while now ( a few years ) and the whole family quite enjoys it . My preschooler eats it without question . I 've found the taste of the pasta ( which does have a discernible nuttiness ) is too overpowering for some of the more delicate pasta sauces ( garlic aoli , a la vodka , etc . ) , but works perfectly in heartier fare , like Bolognese . It 's our go-to pasta choice.2014 UPDATE : After years of using , and loving these , Hodgson Mill has recently reformulated and gone to a pennette ( mini penne ) version of this pasta . Not only is the size less effective at capturing sauce , but the recipe itself has seemed to change and the pasta does n't cook up evenly . No matter how closely I watch , how often I stir and how much water I boil these in , I 'm always left with uncooked pieces while others are overly mushy . Disappointing that they turned a good product into a terrible one .	-1
i got this after the reviews ... The 7 minute cooking time really left my lasagna undercooked . Was a huge waste and ended up trying to fix it but in vain ... I guess it needs longer cooking time that needs to be figured out well ... but really dunno if it was me ... considering this is whole wheat i should have realized . It really did not do well .	-1
I have a standing order for these crackers for a long time . However the latest batches are lacking the usual amount of Sesame Seeds and are lacking the usual great taste . Both I and my husband will change brands , unless this is corrected . Just found out that Sesame seed price is up this year due to shortage !	-1
I have loved these crackers for their complete simplicity , crunch and LACK OF ANY WHEAT PRODUCT . They are no longer wheat free ! They added completely unnecessary wheat gluten . There it is on the label in tiny offending print . The change makes them taste like wall paper paste and are a danger to any human intolerant to gluten . What a waste , I bought a box of packages and I am trying to think of what to do with them .	-1
Now that I have been eating other brand milled flax seeds , when I tasted this one , it tasted very bland and not tasty . I had to cancel future subscriptions . For eating in hot cereal , Trader Joe 's brand is much better although I realize that Hodgson 's is a great quality product .	-1
I have made potato bread before with great results but this Hodgson bread-mix is way too dry , it needs some more moisture-do n't buy it unless you want really dry bread .	-1
I was looking for a healthy and gluten free snack , thought I found it with those rice cake , but when I looked closer I saw that they were manufactured in a factory that also produces products that contains wheat ... I wonder how in this case they can be labelled as gluten free . I know that it not sure that cross contamination happened but I felt bad after eating them so ... and I looked the label after so I was not just because I saw that that I felt bad .	-1
I bought these for my HCG diet , along with melba rounds . I must say , they are not only completely broken into bits , but also not the greatest tasting . In fact , very little taste at all ... and VERY dry and hard to swallow without a big glass of water .	-1
The stick are GOOD , but most are broken . The packaging for these is very lacking . My cat does like to chew on them occasionally , but they would be hard to use for company , broken like that .	-1
To each , his own ... there may be people who will like this , but for us , it was extremely heavy and not much spice flavor to it . It was very moist and the consistency was good , but the whole wheat makes it a very heavy cake . What we did n't care for most is the flavor ... or lack thereof . I think it might be ok if you add powdered spices to it when you are mixing it . Maybe some ginger , cloves , nutmeg , etc ... It sorta reminds me of boston brown bread you buy in the can when made as directed . So , not our cup of tea , but you may like it . It 's not horrible ... just not for us .	-1
Well , good morning family , here try this ! Himself- & # 34 ; It tastes like eating a tree & # 34 ; ... The son- & # 34 ; tastes like a ground up tree & # 34 ; The daughter , & # 34 ; I 'm not touching those things & # 34 ; sigh . hm , where did I go wrong ? I read the directions followed them and wallah ! Muffins that are super good for you that taste like , tree . Oh boy . Here is where I went wrong . I trusted the directions . Next time , use brown sugar , even a substitute would be better am a diabetic as is Himself . I try to foist as much healthy food onto him that I can . Next , put real blueberries from my freezer in to the batter . The package said their dried berries would & # 34 ; plump & # 34 ; up . Nope , they just sorta rode the baking process out , the same size as they went in . When a person wants a muffin it is for a very specific reason . Comfort and deliciousness . While these may provide 'regularity ' darn fast ( sorry , tmi ? ) , they are not comfort food.Will revisit upon my next attempt with a revamp .	-1
I have enjoyed other Hodgson products but this was awful . Heavy , dry , tasteless and unedible . Also , plastic packaging on mine was n't sealed on some . I may report that to Amazon . I thought that was why they were so bad ( stale possibly ? ) but after seeing other reviews ... they are just bad . They need to change the recipe ... healthful does n't have to taste like this .	-1
Amazon was out of the brand I normally use , so I decided to try this . I made a double batch of seitan last night and it was horrible . I nearly sprained my wrists trying to knead it . It was dry and lumpy even after adding more liquid . I should have thrown it away at that point , but I continued on.The result was a dry , tasteless mass . I hope it works better for bread and pizza dough .	-1
This pasta falls apart after being cooked even al dente , and feels slimy in my mouth . Yuck . I hardly ever eat white pasta , so maybe that 's how white pasta is supposed to taste , but for someone who likes the nutty tasty and thick , slightly chewy texture of whole wheat pasta , this stuff is gross . Shame , too . The price and the ingredients are on point .	-1
Yes , it is healthy . But it 's just not tasty . And then if you use it with a heavy topping , like hummus , it breaks into a million sharp crumbs everywhere . You ca n't really put any pressure on it at all , to dip it in something , or to spread something on it . And I do n't really like the taste . I will use them still for a healthy base for something when I need a snack since I bought so many , but I think food should be enjoyable . I like the Sesame ones a bit better , at least , because I like Sesame seeds.In the meantime while I try to use these up , I must say I was very excited to find a substitute that is cheaper , healthy , and crunchy - someone recommended using fresh cucumbers sliced at an angle for salsa and a number of other toppings , both salty and sweet . I 'm not that into cucumbers , but I 'm not against them either , and they do have good anti-inflammatory properties ( particularly if they are organic , or at least well-washed and at least partially peeled ) . I was amazed that it is actually really refreshing and tasty , as well as guilt-free and crunchy ! Unless you need a hot food , like you want to melt some cheese on it or something , I have found that the cucumber is far superior to this cracker in nearly every way ! Sometimes I do n't want so much water content , but I find often that is just when my body is too low on salt so adding some to what I 'm eating works fine even if it 's on a cucumber . If I still just need something dry to snack on , air-popped popcorn is a lot cheaper and easier to flavor than these crackers.They 're not terrible as a product , and I like that they 're all-natural , but I personally do n't like the taste , and thus the price is especially not worth it .	-1
Not a single one of the individual packages inside the boxes were sealed causing all the breadsticks to be stale upon arrival . None of it was edible.There was also a LOT of inconsistency in the packages - some of the breadsticks were very , very dark brown and others were so light it appeared they were not baked enough.On average only 2 breadsticks per package were whole ; the rest were broken into pieces.The one ( very stale ) breadstick that I tried to nibble on ( I chose a med-dark brown one ) , I could tell that it once tasted of olive oil and was probably okay before going stale - similar to the breadsticks I would find on the table of an Italian restaurant when I was a little girl . For this I 'll give it a couple of stars . I am hoping it was just my batch that was unsealed.The expiration date was near the end of 2015 I think . ( To try and not completely waste them and create a ton of trash I ended up giving the packets to one of my neighbors who crushed the stale breadsticks and mixed them with his outdoor bird feeder . I recycled the boxes . )	-1
These are handy packs but we found that they are all broken inside . We get one or two full sticks out of each package and the rest are broken bits . They taste okay , but my homemade ones are much better . These are really just not much of anything .	-1
I would suggest getting the kind in plain oil or completely draining them prior to cooking or eating . I threw it in marinade and all into the dish I was making . I could barely get it down . When I drained the cann and rinsed it , it was decent . The marinade sauce was obnoxious tasting . Also if grains of sand are going to bother you stay away form this product..	-1
TEN CANS OF BITTER SARDINES ! ! ! I tried only one.It had metallic bitter taste , not like the one that people described in the feedbacks.This product is not returnable.I tried THIS BRAND sardines before.Perhaps it is a bad batch.I am afraid to open another one or feed it to somebody else.Amazon refused to accpt complains or returns.This is my warning to others : DO NOT BUY IT .	-1
I bought these with the hopes I could eat them at the movie theater and save myself the extra calories . I started Weight Watchers 3 months ago and you can have 7 vines for 2 points which is really good . I tasted these as soon as I got them in the mail , YUCK ! They are super hard to chew , it took me 20 minutes to chew 1 bite and I thought I was going to rip a tooth out . They have a horrible waxy weird aftertaste that is really bad . My husband likes to chew on them for hours ( because 1 will take you an hour to chew ! ) but he hates the taste . I would spend your money on something other than this .	-1
I agree with the other reviewers who say these Vine are stale and HARD . I had been buying these almost exclusively through Amazon and was willing myself to like them as they were sugar-free and a better option for my sweet tooth . After gnawing through the first batch I got from Amazon , I was notified the Vines were not in stock and headed to a local store and bought a package . HOLY MOLY ! It 's like night and day ! ! ! That 's what Vines are supposed to taste like ! ! ! they were SO soft and I could chew them without getting TMJ . I realized that all Vines are not created equally . I thought , `` hey maybe my first Vine batch was a bad apple '' and lo and behold , my next batch arrived last week ... .I rushed to open the package and taste the chewy goodness I experienced from my local drug store Vines and NOOOOOOO Hard as a rock ! I value my teeth so I am going to cancel my subscribe and save on these Vines . I will pick them up at my local drug store where I can squeeze the package and make sure they are fresh and not going to give me lock jaw . I suggest others do the same until Amazon works out their freshness problem . Maybe my children can use these to make a craft or school project , because they definitely are NOT edible .	-1
These sugar-free strawberry licorice sticks taste more like straw than candy . They taste artificially flavored and are not very appealing . I do not believe I shall re-order them .	-1
These oysters taste good , no question , but cottonseed oil is unhealthful . If you want details ( you should ) , google on , for example , `` Dr Weil cottonseed oil '' . I 'll quote a tiny bit : `` [ Cottonseed oil is ] definitely not [ OK ] . [ ... ] in my book , [ ... ] one of the first things I ask readers to do is to go through their pantry shelves and throw out anything made with cottonseed oil . I regard it as unhealthy because it is too high in saturated fat and too low in monounsaturated fat . What 's more , cottonseed oil may contain natural toxins and probably has unacceptably high levels of pesticide residues ( cotton is not classified as a food crop , and farmers use many agrichemicals when growing it ) . `` So there you have it.When buying oysters ( or sardines , or tuna , or whatever ) in oil , I use the following heuristic : eitherolive oil ( like Crown Prince ( best prices at Trader Joe 's ) , or no oil at all ( go for water , or tomato sauce , or similar ) . If you want oysters , go with Crown Prince oysters , which are packed in pure olive oil and can be had from Trader Joe 's for two-twenty-nine a tin ( I 'm not affiliated with them in any way , shape , or form : this is my personal opinion based on direct experience with the product that I bought myself with me own good money ) .12/09/2013 : TMBatKK wrote in a comment : '' Cottonseed oil has polysat fat , which decreases LDL 's and raises HDL 's which is actually heart healthy . `` A little knowledge is a dangerous thing : First , there 's no such thing as `` polysat '' fat . What TMBatKK means , most likely , is polyUNsaturated fats . Some ( but not all ) of them are beneficial : these are the Omega-3 polyunsaturated fats , ALA . There 's a negligible amount of those in cottonseed oil . There 's a lot of the other kind : Omega-6 -- these are rather harmful and over-present in our diet already . Second , there 's no evidence that cholesterol is the cultprit in heart disease . I do n't want to get into this topic deeper , just research on your own . The theory of cholesterol being a `` bad '' substance may yet turn out to be wrong . Third , my complaints were not just about cottonseed oil 's fat profile -- there 's this pesky issue if cotton not being a food crop and its likely exposure to pesticides/fertilizers/etc . Please re-read Weil 's statement quoted in the original part of this review .	-1
I bought these for my Mom who likes Sardines . She said that they terrible . Unfortunately , they will be discarded , because she lives in another city and is unable to return them . I just wasted my money , when I am trying to help my Mom with her food cost .	-1
This Reese large pearl tapioca is the same size as my small pearl tapioca . Silly me , I thought it would be like the stuff I grew up liking . I was so looking forward to whipping up some large pearl tapioca pudding . I am very disappointed .	-1
I purchased this product based on the other reviews . I would not purchase this item in the future . I still have a couple of cans remaining and will donate them . The oysters are grainy and dry . I have had other smoked oysters that tasted better and looked much more appetizing .	-1
The sardines are extremely tasty , and absolutely free of skin and bones . Definitely superior . Five-star contents.BUT - there were exactly 4 sardines rolling about in a 4.375oz tin , yielding a superpremium price , amounting to $ 0.50 PER SARDINE . The tin could easily have contained 7 or 8 fish of this size . No argument here , save for having been led to believe that this was at least 4oz of fish ( had they been packed traditionally ) , not 50 % oil ( as packed in this instance . ) Negative 3 star practices . Net 2 stars.There was no claim as to quantity or weight of fish - no false claims in the advertising verbiage . This is simply `` sharp '' practice - a `` gotcha '' , for which the company deserves to lose its patronage . ( There is no online Reese resource for complaint , comment , or feedback , adding insult to injury . ) Caveat emptor .	-1
The bars themselves just do n't suit my tastes at all . I was giving them away because the flavors were a bit off for me . At these calories I expect something to taste great .	-1
Although I love organic foods and I especially love blueberries , I have to admit I was quite disappointed with the Wild Blueberry bar from Pure . Not only did it had the texture and taste of a bad fruitcake , but it was less nutritious than a comparative bar like something from Luna or Cliff . It also containing a whopping 14 % of your daily fat intake . The only real value of the bar is in terms of copper and dietary fiber , both of which you can get in many other things and with far less fat . Perhaps a Fiber One bar which has less calories than this and 45 % of your fiber instead of 16 % All in all , I love that Pure bars are mostly organic , but they have no flavour or any actual health benefits . It 's kind of a sham meant to prey on people that just see the word `` organic '' and assume something is actually good for them . Stay away .	-1
I really wanted to like these but they are so dense and just like a condensed goo brick with almost no flavor . The texture is gross and the bars that do have any discernable flavor are so gross it makes me gag . I would never buy these again . Not ever . Especially not banana . Omg so gross . Even the memory of the taste and texture makes me sick .	-1
Pure Bar Organic Cherry Cashew raw fruit and nut bar is not for me . It was like eating an unbaked blob of dough mixed with bits of nuts and tart unripe cherries . I would rather eat a cherry pop tart than this .	-1
I was n't a big fan of this bar . I probably still have a taste for SAD diet foods though I 've only been eating raw for a month . I did n't care for the texture and in my opinon there are n't nearly enough blueberries either . I love the texture of the blueberry Larabar and it tastes SO much better ... to bad the Larabar is n't raw !	-1
I know it 's probably my fault for focusing on the `` blueberry '' vs. the `` nut '' on the label of the Pure Organic Wild Blueberry Fruit & Nut bar , but it definitely did n't meet my expectations . The dominant flavor of this bar is of walnuts . They 're the third ingredient on the label after dates and cashews , but tastewise they take over . I only get the slightest taste of blueberry so I am quite disappointed . At 190 calories for the bar , they are about average for similar snacks and the ingredients list is all organic and raw . I wish I liked the flavor better .	-1
I was surprised to see `` rice protein '' I do n't know if it 's as bad as I think it is , but none the less , I did n't like the bar at all . Three adults and one 3 year old split a bar . My adult daughter and I did n't even finish our 1/4 of the bar . Only the 3 year old ate his . I 've had other fruit and nut bars from Amazon and they were OK . I have n't been crazy about any of them , but his one I actually did n't like at all .	-1
I 've been giving several organic products a go lately , but is the first PURE Organic I 've tried and I have to say it 's not selling me on the idea of trying more.Visually UnappealingI opened the package to see something that looked a lot like what I 'd imagine beer dung to look like if it was flattened and chopped into a 3 '' x2 '' rectangle . Nuts and blueberries are visible through a brown paste , which has a slight sheen to it.Taste and TextureThe best part - you taste the nuts ( walnuts , almonds and cashews ) almost immediately . Actually I thought there was oats in it , but it 's all in the nuts . Texture is somewhat pasty and fibrous , but thankfully not dry.Lots of fiber ( 3g ) which according to the label may contain 'pieces of nuts , shells , stems or pits ' . Not reassuring , but definitely organic ! Certified organic , this bar has rice protein and agave nectar , with a few other this and that thrown in , but very little . It 's considered 'raw , vegan , rich in omega-3 's , a full serving of fruit , certified organic and gluten-free ' . Taste however , at least for me , it lacks.Overall , I liked the idea of it , and will give the makers kudos for putting all kinds of good stuff in there , but if you need to find a quick snack that 's under 200 calories and is gluten-free , consider a handful of raw almonds and a piece of fruit instead . It would taste much better and probably cost the same or less .	-1
Sadly , that also goes for taste . Sure , this is healthy . If you are a health nut who views food as mere sustenance and does n't look to eat things that taste good then by all means , dig in . Personally though , I take my food a little more seriously . I love to eat healthy ( or at least I want to love to eat healthy ) but I also require that my food taste good.I do n't just want to feel full , I want to feel satisfied.PURE organic bars are full of organic goodness , but they do n't do anything for my taste buds . I 'll say too that the consistency of the bar itself is not really that appetizing . I 've had fruit bars before , and they are rather gummy in texture and that is n't really appealing to me , and this bar is similar in texture . For a ` Wild Blueberry ' bar too , I did n't get very much blueberry flavor.It was kind of bland.There are certainly better tasting bars out there that are healthy for you . They may not be organic and they may not have ` nothing ' in them , but they at least have some flavor.There is a long list of no 's on the back ; they should have added ` no taste ' to the list .	-1
Pure hypes this as `` Organic , Vegan , 4 grams of fiber ... '' and so on for a long paragraph . I do n't really care . It looks like a candy bar or a snack bar and that 's how I 'll review it.It 's not disgusting . I can taste the cherry . It does n't have a noticeable aftertaste . And that 's about it on the positive side.The negative side is n't large . The texture is n't pleasant . Although I could see the cashew chunks I did n't notice any cashew flavor - and I like cashew so that was a disappointment.It 's nice to have the Omega 3s , vitamins and what not but I take supplements for those anyway and those are n't mildly annoying to eat.Summing up , I have little use for this but it was n't bad enough to warrant a 1 star review . However , if you 're heavily into the `` organic '' stuff this is worth looking at .	-1
I gave this bar two stars instead of one because it did not make me sick . However , it does not taste very good . It has a sort of mealy consistency . The cashew and cherry flavors come through . It is not excessively sweet . I ate one for breakfast and found it moderately filling . The ingredients , of course , are excellent , but they are also found in actual food.There are so many good-tasting bars out there - such asLUNA : Nutz Over Chocolate Bar : 15 CountorAtkins Day Break Bars , Cranberry Almond , 1.2-Ounce Bars ( Pack of 15 ) , that this would not be the one I reach for on the grocery store shelf . If I was starving to death , though , this bar would come in handy .	-1
The bar is healthy judging from the ingredients . I was looking forward to getting it because I love cherries and cashews . And , I 'm always looking for a good health bar . But , I was disappointed when I tried it . In fact , no one in my family ( two daughters and wife ) really enjoyed it . It 's rather dry and not very appealing .	-1
I 'm from Oregon and we grow a lot of blueberries in this state . This tastes to me like imitation blueberries ( it includes `` organic blueberry flavor '' ) . It 's got great ingredients , but the flavor did n't trill me.On the other hand , I love the PURE `` Cherry Cashew '' bar ... it is yummy ! One word of caution : This product is certified gluten free and a proud supporter of the Celiac Disease Foundation , but if you look closely there is small letters that say it is produced in a facility that processes wheat !	-1
Our family often eats granola bars , especially ones that are high in fiber . I was happy to give this little bar a try . While cherry is not my favorite flavor , I kept an open mind when trying this bar . I do really love cashews , so I thought the combination might be interesting and tasty . My husband an I both had a bite , and we both agreed it was too thick . It was not an enjoyable texture or flavor ( even for my husband , who is a cherry fan ) . The cashew flavor was very subtle . If you are a huge fan of cherry flavored bars , you may want to give this one a try . Unfortunately , for our family , we will not be trying it again .	-1
I was looking forward to the taste of cherries . What I got was a dark , dense , unpleasantly non-cherry chunk that was slightly sour-tasting . It is something I might keep in my car on the offchance that I get caught in a blizzard and find myself stranded in a snowbank for three days . This bar would keep me alive ... and keep me opening the car door to swallow lots of snow in order to get the taste out of my mouth . Disappointing and not something I would recommend .	-1
I chose this rating because a high sugar content was not revealed online before buying it . Might as well have bought real brownies .	-1
This may be good for you , but it is like eating cardboard with a few nuts tossed in . One bite was too much .	-1
I 've had a variety of fruit bars over the years and this is definitely one of the worst . It does n't have a great deal in the way of good flavor and it 's over burdened with cashews and walnuts ( neither of which I like ) . The labeling makes great hey out of the fact that it 's not got gluten , does n't use GMO 's , has no cholesterol , no trans-fats , and that the blueberries used therein are raw . Because , you know , mankind was doing fine before we actually started cooking our foods.Beyond the hype of the product , there 's not really anything worthwhile here , and lord help you if you have a nut allergy . This thing just did n't taste good and I ca n't say as though I have any interest in ever eating any more . Put it this way : When I first opened the box I was a little disappointed to see only one bar therein instead of a pack of twelve . Now I 'm just relieved .	-1
I love blueberries . I love Luna bars , but this bar was terrible . Just terrible . The texture is that of a wet , soggy power bar . The taste is bland and awful , I am not sure . This was so terrible I spit it out . Its difficult to describe the taste because it was so ... gross . This is so terrible , I am not even going to keep typing about it . I am not kidding.Note : `` Pure '' and `` Organic '' does not mean that it has to taste bad and feel disgusting . This product merely does .	-1
I was hoping for a good experience , but was dissapointed . The bar was very oily and had a lack of taste . I couldnt finish it .	-1
Nutrition Information : Calories 190fat Cal 70total Fat 8gcholest 0mgfiber 3gsugars 17gprotein 7gThe packaging is enticing , I 'd at least pick it up in the grocery store to look at since it 's organic . But , it is pretty high in calories for such a small bar . The consistency was like a very thick fruit roll up ( very sweet and chewy ) with chunks of cashews throughout , which was the only part I liked . It was too heavy for me . I 'll stick with some of the other bars lower in calories if I 'm in a pinch ( really enjoy Luna bars ) .	-1
Sounded good ... .organic , no refined sugar , lots of vitamins/minerals , antioxidants , low sodium ... .but alas ... .I would not purchase this . First off it looked well , yucky , a rectangular brown bar ... not appealing , but if it tastes good , I thought , then I could get past the unappetizing look . So , I took a bite and well , it tastes like your Aunt 's old fruitcake recipe , except chewier . I 'm sorry , but no matter how much I want to snack on healthier foods and buy organic , I ca n't recommend this one . I got a bit of a nutty taste , but could n't quite taste the cherry either , but maybe it was because I could n't get past the fruitcake'y ' kind of flavor.So , though you could buy many bars that taste worst , I will not be purchasing this one . It just did n't have the appealing look or flavor to make me buy it . Too bad-looks like there are lots of reasons why , if it tasted good that this would be the one to buy , but once again I vote flavor over just good for you , so I 'd have to give this one a pass .	-1
This bar did n't taste terrible , but it did n't taste good , either . Just kind of blah . I split it with a friend , and all she could taste was sweetness with some cherry flavor , and all I could taste was a faint cashew flavor . If you 're looking for a benign organic option , high in calories ( 190 for a small bar ) , give this a try . If you 're looking for something higher in protein and more flavorful , look elsewhere .	-1
Passion fruits contain major medicinal benefits according to studies . It has a high amount of antioxidants which protect from cancer , ageing and inflammation . It 's a good source of fiber which is effective to improve digestion . It also has high levels of potassium that helps reduce risk of heart attack . While its fruits may not always be readily available , I getMarkizza Passion Fruit Juice Drinkby delifreshusa.com on Amazon , that 's all natural and refreshing , not from concentrate . Read about passion fruits to see for yourself .	-1
I really tried to like the Wild Blueberry bar but I just did not enjoy it all . It sounds good in theory-no cholesterol , no trans fats , no artificial ingredients , no refined sugar , it 's rich in Omega-3s , it 's got fiber , it 's got calcium and it 's a full serving of fruit . On my first taste , I chewed it a couple times before spitting it out . My second bite went down but I just could n't get into the flavor . The calorie count is rather high for a small bar and I think I could find something more satisfying , more tasty , and just as healthy to eat for about the same amount of calories .	-1
I was a bit disappointed in the taste of this bar . The nut flavor was good and nice and crunchy , but it did n't taste anything like blueberries . It was kind of a gooey ( or gluey ) , chewy bar with a taste that is hard to describe . Not a bad taste , but I doubt it 's anything kids would like that much . I assume there is no added sugar , which is a real plus . I suppose it is good to be eating something natural , but why not just eat the nuts and blueberries separately instead of crushed and compacted into a bar ? Convenience would be the only reason I can think of and these would have a longer shelf life than fresh blueberries . Great for campers or hikers who do n't want a high sugar snack .	-1
love blueberries but barely tastes like blueberry , good idea but no real flavor and not filling in anyway	-1
The texture reminded me of the center of a Fig Newton cookie but slightly moister . I would use these on a camping trip or hiking event but would not use on a daily basis . The flavor was bland and I did not care for the texture which I found to be pastey . Tended to stick to the roof of my mouth and was a little hard to swallow . Did not get a distinct blueberry flavor . The most flavorful was when a bite would contain a nut . The actual appearance of the bar is not appealing in the least . I almost threw half of it away but then went ahead and forced the rest down . Organic healthy snacks can be healthy and taste good but not this bar . I kept thinking of wet soggy flavored cardboard .	-1
I received one small bar through the Vine program . Opening the wrapper revealed an ugly looking brown mess . Throwing caution to the wind I took a bite . It tasted like I was eating a piece of cardboard with a barely detectable blueberry hint . This horrible tasting thing has 190 calories and a whole bushel of fat . No way could I take another bite . This ugly , calorie laden and fat enhanced glob is resting comfortably in my garbage can . Do n't believe the hype .	-1
My one son loves Think Organic bars but he would not eat these . He did n't like them at all . I ended up giving them to the snack pantry at school because no one at our house would eat them .	-1
When I ordered this snack bar , I expected something likeNature Valley Chewy Trail Mix Bars , Fruit & Nut , 6-Count Boxes ( Pack of 12 ) , something with lots of nuts and a little dried fruit . When I received the package and opened it , however , I found that it was the opposite : dried fruit with nuts mixed in . It looked like dark chocolate , only kind of waxy , not very appetizing . But looks are n't the most important part of a snack , so I bit in.And it was n't very good . It had a tart , almost bitter taste . Tart is fine when there 's another taste to complement it , but the only other flavor here was that cardboard-y , health-food taste . The consistency was pretty good , though-chewy , but not too chewy . And the bar does have a good shelf-life.The wrapper is pretty , but it 's not bio-degradable , which I 'm sure is important to a lot of organic food lovers.This snack is pretty good for you . All the materials are organic , nothing but dried fruit and nuts . It has a lot of antioxidants like omega3s . There are 17g of sugar , but it 's all from the fruit , so it 's better for you than products with added sugars . There 're 8g of fat , .5g of saturated fat , and 190 calories . That 's not bad , but I was hoping there would be some monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fats in it . The snack bar is gluten free , dairy free , and vegen , and that 's good . You get 3g of fiber , but there 's not a whole lot more nutritive value . You can exchange the bar for 1.5 fruits.And honestly , I would do just that . Fruit sure tastes better , and if you choose the right fruit , more nutritious . There really are n't a lot of nuts in this , and I was hoping for more ( that 's what she said ) . I think an organic trail mix would be a better choice . This snack is n't bad for you , but honestly , the best thing about that is that you can eat something else later without feeling guilty .	-1
This bar may have simple ingredients , but I could not deal with the taste ( not sweet enough for me ) . Also , the texture was as though the nuts and fruits were just pressed together as opposed to the consistent chewy texture of other bars .	-1
While I like the fact that this bar has organic ingredients , I wo n't buy it because it has Agave as the main sweetener . Agave is pure fructose at 93 % versus High fructose corn syrup . Agave is a `` fake healthy '' sweetener .	-1
Well Cherry and Cashew hmmm sounds good right ? Well mostly it 's not either of these and has a high calorie , carb , and sugar content . I could live with that if it tasted better , sadly it just does not . For that high a calorie content , sugar content and carb content , I could have a nice dark organic chocolate bar with no added sugar that would be much healthier . It was not the worst thing I ever ate but not all that good either . I would not recommend it , or buy it if I was looking for something of this nature . It sure looked good , unfortunately in the taste department it fails , and as far as healthy its not all that .	-1
My two favorite things , cherries and cashews ! Unfortunately , I could have a candy bar instead of this 190 calorie bar . The smell is not enticing and the taste is flat . Not sweet , not salty ... . just blah .	-1
The main problem with the Pure Bar Organic Cherry Cashew , is that it does n't taste like cherry or Cashew.It 's made of just a few assorted nuts and a few assorted fruits rolled into a bar . And I 'm not sure exactly what it tastes like . it 's like one bar of flavor confusion . I ca n't tell what it tastes like.Maybe I would have liked it better had it actually tasted like cherry and/or cashew	-1
Considering the ingredients , I 'd rather snack on a mix of high quality dried cherries and nuts than on a bar that is mostly dates ( note : dates are listed 1st in the ingredient list , with cherries 3rd ) . Dates are a fine fruit , but for a bar named Cherry Cashew , I expect , well , cherries & cashews ! Though the flavor was OK , the crunch of nuts was totally lost in the heavy , chewy mixture that was the basis for the bar.The pre-packaged bars are definitely convenient ( grab and go ) . Still , for my money , I 'd prefer buying dried fruit & fresh nuts in bulk , mixing up a batch to my taste , then storing in small reusable containers to throw in the lunch bag or purse during the week .	-1
I 'm a big fan of blueberries and this bar does not do them justice . From the product description , `` We specifically choose apple juice-infused ( not sugar-infused ) wild blueberries to avoid refined sugars '' , which is a shame because blueberries are naturally sweet . The texture is similar to a Fig Newton , slightly chunkier , but still not appetizing for me.For the nitpickers out there , they also claim the product is gluten , soy and dairy free , but then state it is produced in a facility that processes soy , milk , egg , wheat , peanuts , fish and tree nuts . Oh well , I suppose in our `` economies of scale '' world maybe it 's impossible to produce items without having them contaminated by unrelated ingredients and the hyper-sensitive part of our society dictates these have to be called out . Too bad . I think I 'll stick to dried blueberries and a bag of granola which are both healthier , cheaper and more environmentally friendly than this bar .	-1
Well , I was excited about trying this product especially since I like cherries and cashews . When it arrived , I opened it up and took a bit ( it arrived about mid-afternoon ) . I caught a little cherry flavor then cashew at first but it disappeared quickly and the next bit did n't help either . Sorry , but this is not very appetizing to my palette . I choose my caloric intake carefully and this just does n't come up to a positive for me . Maybe another combination might do it ! I would suggest a little more cherry flavor and that possibly through adding additional sweetner to the mix . The crunch , the cashews are just fine but the lack of continuing flavor not good .	-1
I guess this bar is healthy ... it has good ingredients . Not enough of any of the ingredients to get a good dose of what makes those ingredients healthy , however . For your nearly 200 calories you get almost no vitamins or minerals to speak of . There are nice chunks of nuts , but since they are n't toasted first they do n't have that flavorful crunchiness . ( And yes , I get that toasting would make this a NON-raw food , as if being raw is necessarily worthwhile , anyway . ) The bar is just bland with some vague blueberry taste . Just brownish-purple gumminess with little pieces of dried blueberry and big pieces of raw nuts . It may have 6 grams of protein , but 190 calories are n't going to sustain you for long , regardless . My teenage son ( who eats anything ) took one bite and handed it right back . Frankly , if I 'm going to throw away 200 calories on what basically amounts to an empty calorie snack , I 'll find something more appealing .	-1
The first and occasional taste of real blue berry made me keep trying another bite , but each time I did I became less satisfied with the bar . I was hoping that it would have been more like the KIND Fruit plus Nut Bar , which has a very satisfying taste and texture , but instead it was more like a chewy gooey unidentifiable powerbar with some nuts and fruit added . If you like the normal powerbar goo ( which I do not ) , then this could be a good fit for you as the addition of the fruit and nuts could make it more interesting . It definitely felt like it would fill you up for the 190 calories , but I like to enjoy the food I it as well .	-1
The ingredients listed on the wrapper of my Pure Organic Wild Blueberry bar differ substantially from the list on the Amazon page ( though , in fairness , the listing says that ingredients may vary -- but this much ? ? ) . Here 's what it says on Amazon today : '' Organic Dates , Organic Wild Blueberries ( With Organic Apple Juice Concentrate and Organic Canola Oil ) , Organic Cashews , Organic Almonds , Organic Unsweetened Lemon Juice Concentrate . `` Here 's what I got , as listed on the wrapper : '' Organic Dates ; Organic Cashews ; Organic Walnuts ; Organic Rice Protein Concentrate ; Organic Wild Blueberries ( With Organic Apple Juice Concentrate and Organic Sunflower Oil ) , Organic Agave Nectar , Organic Almonds , Organic Lemon Juice Concentrate ; Organic Blueberry Flavor and that 's all ! `` That 's a HUGE difference.For me , the main problem is walnuts , though . Although I 'm not allergic , I have a sensitivity to walnuts that causes slight irritation in the mouth and an associated bitter taste . So , that 's strike one , but that 's just me . Just sayin'.I just do n't get a satisfying flavor and texture from this snack . The date texture comes through in the slight gumminess , but there 's really no berry or even fruity sweetness or tanginess there . The cashew/walnut mixture makes for an overwhelming , much nuttier flavor and texture than I had expected with a product highlighted as a blueberry snack . I 'll take a pass on this one .	-1
I do n't know if it was the weird , acrid aftertaste of something the resembled blueberries the way blue Gatorade resembles blueberries , or the dry , choking mealiness of a bar that nevertheless left my fingers sticky , but I 'm just not at all a fan of this bar . If there were nuts in it , I never noticed , although that may explain the thin wafers I had to prod out of my gums afterwards .	-1
My kids usually love anything that has the words `` bar '' and `` fruit '' in it . But after a couple nibbles of this , they put them on the counter and said , `` I do n't want this . '' I tasted it and did n't blame them . It 's bland , and just plain lacking . I did n't eat it either -- it went into the trash . We tried both cherry and blueberry flavors -- same reaction to both . I 'd recommend Larabars instead of this if you 're looking for raw food or bars with no added sugar .	-1
Maybe if I was stuck on a desert island and only had these to eat ... then I would eat it again . I did not like the taste or the consistency .	-1
This bar contains only good ( not processed ) ingredients with dates and cashews first and second in the ingredients list . However , I thought the bar was tasteless and slightly sweet . At 190 calories a bar ( 70 fat calories ) , it is not something I would purchase because I felt unsatisified after eating it .	-1
I liked the fact that this bar was all organic , but hey does that mean that because it 's organic , it gets a pass on taste ? I do n't think so . It was just okay . You can find better tasty and organic alternatives in my opinion that are not as pricey . I was not sure what to make of the texture which like one reviewer said , is not crunchy and is something like a fig newton bar . The bar itself is pretty small and for the calories , I think you can eat something else that would probably be less calories and more filling . I just was not impressed at all by this bar . Not sure if I would purchase if given the chance .	-1
I had high hopes for the Pure Bar Organic Wild Blueberry , Raw Fruit & Nut Bar and am sad to say I was disappointed . The description sounded appealing and the flavor sounded like a good one which is why I decided to try it . I loved the fact it was organic , all natural , high in fiber and omega-3s . Unfortunately , I was completely unimpressed.The texture was the first thing I noticed about the Pure Bar Organic Wild Blueberry , Raw Fruit & Nut Bar that I did not like . It was grainy and a bit chalky , completely unappealing to me . I also did not like the fact they use apple juice as a sweetener for the bar , touting the fact this is all natural and not refined sugar . However , apple juice is one of the highest sugar content fruit juices available on the market and is often used as a sweetener/filler in products because it is so cheap to produce , so this was not a positive selling point for me at all.Also , for this being sold as a blueberry bar , the blueberry flavor was not nearly as strong as I would expect from a `` blueberry bar . '' Personally , blueberries are one of my absolute favorite fruits and one I can not get enough of when they are in season . So I had hoped this bar would have tasted better . The other ingredients , the nuts and the dates , overwhelmed the blueberries , not surprising when you look at the ingredient list and see that blueberries are not even one of the top 5 on the list.I can honestly say that I will not be adding the Pure Bar Organic Wild Blueberry , Raw Fruit & Nut Bar to my grocery list in the future and will continue seeking other alternatives instead . Kelley A. Hartsell , June 2010 . All rights reserved .	-1
Okay , these are good for people who are on gluten-free , kosher , vegan , or soy-free diets , and they do have vitamins , but the taste is very bland . The bar is all natural -- organic and raw . Were those blueberries I tasted or cardboard ? I 'd rather go hungry than eat this .	-1
Maybe I was raised on too many processed sugars and prepackaged food but it seems the more `` natural '' things get , the more they tend to taste like cardboard . Needless to say , I was not a big fan of this product .	-1
Not exactly stale but almost ... not exactly fresh ! That 's the way this bar tasted in my opinion . I shared it with my friend , who liked it no more than I did . I did not taste cherries or cashews , but it is a cherry cashew bar . The first ingredient listed is dates . I like fresh-tasting dates . What would be wrong with mentioning dates in the name of the product ? I like walnuts too . Are n't many people allergic to walnuts ? The bar is `` raw '' with `` nothing cooked '' and `` nothing processed '' according to the label . Yet it contains `` rice protein '' that must have been separated from the rest of the kernel . Was that process processing ? The bar was sweet enough but not tasty enough to satisfy our taste buds . These are mere opinions.A few facts : `` Allergy statement : contains cashews , walnuts , almonds . This product is produced in a facility that processes soy , milk , wheat , peanuts , fish , tree nuts . '' The bar weighs 1.7 ounces and contains 190 calories , including 70 fat calories . The label on the front says , `` Pure for all people . '' The list price for 12 of these bars is $ 30.00 , but it is selling on Amazon for $ 19.89 . Shipping weight for twelve bars is 1.4 pounds . The product description says the bar has a `` good dose of vitamin C '' but the label says a serving of one bar provides 6 % of the daily requirement of vitamin C .	-1
I received both a blueberry and cherry Pure Bar . The blueberry is much better . Both are a little dry . Both are not as sweet as other raw bars -- which is actually nice change . I ca n't recommend the cherry one at all ... but the blueberry one would be nice on occasion . Ca n't see myself purchasing an entire box.I really think that if you 're trying to eat healthfully ... and want something that has real fruit and nuts in it ... you 're much much better off buying some dried or fresh cherries and nuts . If you love dates , buy some medjool ones . 1000x healthier ... most likely cheaper ... much tastier ... .and just as convenient . You do n't need added agave and all the other nonsense .	-1
Okay , if you are a health nut or vegan , or into organics , this is for you . It 's certified organic , gluten free , rich in Omega 3 's , raw , and Vegan . It says it 's a good source of fiber , but at 3 grams per serving , I 'd say it 's just an okay source of fiber.There are no refined sugars , no gluten , dairy , or soy , no cholesterol , no trans fats , to preservatives , or artificial anythings.There is also no flavor . Unless you like to eat cardboard , which I do n't . Plus , it 's about the size of my pinky , so you 're not getting much.If I 'm going to waste 200 calories on some kind of health bar , I 'm going to make sure it tastes good . Cherry or blueberry did n't matter , it still tasted bad , and the other benefits for me , were n't worth the calories .	-1
I received this as part of the Amazon Vine and only got one bar to try . So I can not say if the flavor is consistent between bars and I can not judge if all are supposed to taste like this.As advertised , this is an Organic & Raw product . So if you have never had raw cashews , cherries or dates , you may not get the flavor you expect , especially with the cashews . Most people are used to them salted and roasted . In this bar , the dates and walnuts were the dominate flavor , not the cherries or the cashews . It tasted more like a raisin walnut bar , than a cherry cashew bar.The bar is a little small compared to most snack bars , about an inch and a half by three inches and the package is a little deceptive in that is larger than the bar by over an inch.Overall , I ca n't give it a high rating since the Cherry and Cashew flavor is dominated by the Date and Walnut . And as I said , I only have one bar to try , so I do n't know if others are better , but for the price I would expect the flavor listed to be correct and the bars to be a bit bigger .	-1
The Pure bar advertises itself as nothing but pure , raw , fruits and nuts , which is true , though a tiny bit misleading , as there 's a healthy dose of added sugar in the form of agave syrup , which is boiled down from raw agave . Agave does sound exotic , and suggestive of all sorts of healing properties , but truth be told it 's not terribly different from corn syrup at the nutritional level- it consists of anywhere from 56 % to 92 % fructose , with the remainder being glucose , and trace amounts of flavor compounds.The bulk of the bar is dried dates , nuts , and cherries , ground up and formed into something that looks rather like the inside of a Fig Newton bar . As for taste ... well , it tastes rather like the inside of a Fig Newton bar . GIven that these cost , on a per ounce basis , about five times what Fig Newtons cost , I 'd expect something a bit tastier . If you 're looking for a healthy snack , you can buy your own dried fruits and nuts for half the cost of these , and I 'll bet they 'll taste a heck of a lot better , too .	-1
Upon opening the wrapper , I noticed that the inside of it looked as though the bar had sweated profusely while on its trip to my home . Not a promising sign . The bar itself looked very unappealing , like something that had been made with an industrial extruder into which someone threw blueberries , oats and other healthy-type food . At least it smelled edible . The bar is definitely blueberry flavor , but with a twist . Imagine if you had a piece of blueberry pie while you were out at a nice hillside picnic . Now imagine that you dropped your pie piece and it rolled down the hill and into a nearby forest , all the while collecting dirt , leaves , twigs and other detritus . Now eat that pie . That is what this bar tastes like .	-1
I like the premise of these bars ( raw , organic ) enough to consider trying another flavor sometime , but cherry was not a hit at my house . The main ingredient is dates , and the bar is very dark , with almost a molasses-type flavor . The cherries are tangy , which is good , but the agave sweetener makes the whole thing too sweet . There are 17 grams of sugar despite the fact that the bar is tiny . Dried fruit ( which this basically seems to be ) has a LOT of sugar already . You 'd really be better off eating fresh fruit.Along those lines , the nutrition from this bar is very poor ; do n't be tricked into thinking it 's `` healthy . '' While it does contain 12 % of your daily fiber , there 's also 12 % of your daily fat ( and did I mention these bars are tiny ? ! ) . Then , drum roll please , it contains very little of anything else . Vitamin A ( 0 % ) ; vitamin C ( 6 % ) . Nothing is higher than 6 % .Bottom line , this is probably better for you than a bag of Cheetos , but not by all that much , and you may have a hard time selling it to your kids .	-1
What an unpleasant taste and texture ! This is a little brown bar , very flat and solid , and it tastes like compressed fruitcake , only not sweet . It smells and tastes like some kind of dried fruit . What is the sweetener here , prune juice ? IS there a sweetener here ? It 's foods like this that give `` natural foods '' a bad name . Cherries and cashews are delicious -- how did they get THIS bar out of those delicious foods ? This was gross , I 'm sorry .	-1
The taste of this bar is OK but not that great . I guess it is just a matter of preference . I have tasted other organic fruit and nut bars and they had a lot more flavor . The ingredients are good for you but with not nuch flavor .	-1
Yes , it may claim to be all organic and such ... but , yuck ! This is the worst bar I have ever had . I am always looking for a good , healthy , organic AND tasty bar , but this ... tasted like cardboard , with a nut here and there . I have eaten two of these , and the first one was so bad that the second one made me gag . I love theClif ZbarandKashi . They are tasty , this is not.Although the list of ingredients sounds good ( health wise ) and the flavor says cherry chashew , it asll tasted disgusting to me . If you are looking for a vegan/organic bar that actually DOES taste like what it is supposed to be , check outPROBAR Fruition Superfood Snack Bar , Strawberry . The Fruition is seriosuly yummy . With a capital Y , the good Y .	-1
I am not big on energy bars or health bars . This does not taste that great . It is a good health choice but I like the fig nut-tons better . I overall think if you like organic or want a healthy snack this is fine . Since its all natural kids might like it .	-1
Well now , here we have yet another healthy bar to snack on , but unfortunately this bar has very little taste and what taste it does have is nothing I would want to eat . I 'm all for healthy eating , but we live only once and I prefer to eat something that taste good . It has the consistency of a fruit roll up without being very sweet . The bar has an slightly sour taste and the nuts are soft ( yuck ! ) . There are numerous better tasting bars on the market that are healthy so as a food source this would only be eaten if all other food disappeared off the planet !	-1
I tried several of these bars , but I had to hold my breath to take a bite -- they smell terrible ! Like vinegar or something . Most unpleasant . The taste is n't bad , but it ai n't a chocolate brownie , I do n't care what any of the other reviews say !	-1
I opened this package to find a dense , nearly black bar with nut bits in it . As I held it up in my hand , I thought , `` Did I already eat this ? `` Needless to say , a bar that reminds me of a square of bear poop did n't really strike my fancy from the get go , but I was thinking maybe it would taste good even if it did n't look that great . But nope , it was bland and sour.I did n't like it . For 170 calories ( if memory serves ) I 'll just grab a granola bar . Maybe its not perfectly organic or whatever , but I 'll actually want to eat it , and when it comes to FOOD that seems to be a pretty important quality .	-1
Aw . I really wanted to like this raw fruit & nut bar because a raw food bar is such a great concept . But the bar tasted mainly like old nuts and vitamins . There are n't added vitamins in the ingredients , but that 's still what I tasted . The fruits ( dates and cherries ) make the bar medium-sweet . But I certainly would n't guess that this was a cherry-flavored bar . I think this might be a better bar with a different combination of FRESH nuts ( maybe minus walnuts , plus macadamias to add to the almonds and cashews in it ) and with better quality fruit . I would have preferred a stronger cherry taste , but I really only got a faint figgy taste from it . I imagine I 'll be steering clear of this brand in the future .	-1
These bars are a bit small for the price and I found them to be way too chewey for my pleasure . I shared this bar with my boyfriend - both of us eat different types of food bars during the day - and neither of us would buy this again . The flavor was lacking and the texture was too dense .	-1
No refined sugar , no gluten , dairy or soy , no cholesterol , trans fats , preservatives or anything artificial , sounded great to me but ... .I tried this PURE organic cherry cashew bar from Amazon and all I can taste is the overwhelming rancid nuts . I have to rate this item based on my experience , so sadly I can only give it one star . Not much else I can say based on what I tried other then all the ingredients listed are good simple and organic . Problem with all these natural foods which contain nuts especially raw nuts is that they are extremely volatile and have 0 shelf life because there are no preservatives . Too bad something with the best of intentions ca n't make it to the public to enjoy before going bad . These bars sound really good and probably are if you are lucky enough to get one that has n't spoiled , I have n't been that lucky .	-1
As my reviews for Cliff and Kashi products show , I like natural/organic food products . So I was excited to try the new Pure Bar Organic Wild Blueberry , Raw Fruit & Nut Bar . This is the kind of thing that I eat for a snack on a regular basis , and I 'm always looking for new things to mix into my rotation . Unfortunately , this product will not be one of the ones that I add.I 'm not going to address the nutrition aspects because at a basic level you have to like a product first . I had a couple of issues with the blueberry bar that I tried . First , the nuts in the bar are soggy and as such not as crisp as I prefer . I like the crunch that the almonds in Kashi 's TLC Honey Almond Flax bars have much better than what the Pure bar had . Second , the overall texture seemed very gritty and muddy ( I do n't like pinto beans for similar reasons ) . I thought the blueberry flavor was OK , but it was not enough to overcome the other issues that I mentioned.So , there 's still a chance that you might like these wild blueberry bars . However , if your tastes are like mine , you 're going to want to pass . If you have a specific question that I did not address , please feel free to post it as a comment , and I will try to answer in a timely manner .	-1
This product should be sent back to the design team . Why ? - Organic but tasteless- It should focus on one main ingredient , instead of mixing all kind of things- The nuts are too mushy , not crispy anymoreThe only positive thing is that it is not infused with sugar . The fruit juice sweetens it.Fix this product and let me review again .	-1
On the package it states what other types of food items are processed in the same facility . If I was vegan , it would worry me that this raw fruit and nut bar was made in a place where they process fish.The taste was nothing to write home about , it tasted like a badly artifically flavored blueberry muffin and the texture was not very enjoyable . I guess if I was starving I might be able to eat the whole bar , but I was able to eat less than half of it and kept trying to give the rest to my son.I think the product page needs to be updated to reflect what other food items are processed in the facility , I misplaced the package , but if I remember correctly they included : milk , soy , peanuts , and fish . I think buyers should be able to know what else is processed there , so they can make an informed decision before buying this product	-1
I like my wholegrain organic bars as much as the next guy , but this bar , and the other one did not impress me . Organic is bandied about , but it does not always mean tastes good . I prefer fiber one bars , nutrigrain bars , and even planter 's peanut bars over this . Low on flavor , low on texture , and at the end of the day do we really need another bar ? I hope they find traction , but I was underwhelmed .	-1
I had high hopes for this treat . It sure sounded yummy based on the description . HOWEVER , it was like the insides of a fig newton , but only after being left out on the counter for a couple of years . It had an unpalatable appearance , did n't smell very good , and did n't really taste much of cherry or cashew . It 's fairly high in fat . I 'm not very adept at describing flavors , but truly this had a kind of vague fruity taste that was at best non-descript . I had originally split my bar with my wife , but she took one small bite and set it aside . `` Maybe you 'll like it , '' she said tentatively . I did not.I will never try another product from this company .	-1
As a person who is more involved with health and nutrition than the average person that has also purchased raw food bars before , I was happy that this was offered though the Amazon Vine program and I glady ordered the sample . It tastes good and it claims to contain `` nothing cooked , nothing processed , '' but that is not the simple truth . The bar contains `` agave nectar '' which does not occur naturally . It is not unprocessed and it is in fact , a highly cooked and processed sweetener . It is derived from processing and cooking the core of the blue agave plant for many hours in order to break down its starches into sugars . Agave nectar was originally touted as a `` healthy alternative '' to table sugar , but it is potentially much worse than table sugar on your body . It is essentially a super high fructose syrup , just like high fructose corn syrup , but with a much higher fructose content . Typical high fructose corn syrup used in soft drinks is about 55 % fructose while agave nectar contains a whopping 85-90 % fructose . First of all , I do n't understand why they thought they needed to sweeten this `` raw '' bar , and second , they used `` agave nectar '' which sounds good to the uninformed , but it is not a raw ingredient and it has a very high fructose content . I think they used `` agave nectar '' to hide the additional fructose ( or sugar ) on the label . There is controversy , but fructose and particularly agave nectar may be bad for you.You can research for yourself , google `` agave nectar bad '' and look for entries from `` foodrenegade , '' `` nourishedkitchen '' and `` living-foods '' You can also google `` fructose bad '' check out the hits from `` about '' and `` the american journal of clinical nutrition '' Fructose and in particular , High Fructose Corn Syrup are the subjects of much controversy today . There are studies that conclude that there is no appreciable difference between sucrose and fructose to our bodies ( and of course , fructose is a component of sucrose ) . There are also studies that indicate fructose may be problematic . Regardless of which camp you 're in , `` agave nectar '' is a hidden source of fructose in this bar and it is not raw . The fact that the manufacturer of this bar claims `` nothing cooked and nothing processed '' is nothing short of fraud .	-1
Totally tasteless , will not order again . I usually share my purchases with others but not this time . I had high hopes for this product as I try to eat healthy . This is so below standard that it should not even be classified as a brownie .	-1
The Pure Organic Wild Blueberry Raw Fruit and Nut Bar is surprisingly bland . Its ingredients include a variety of `` organic '' ingredients - several different kinds of nuts , dates , blueberries , rice protein concentrate , agave nectar , lemon juice concentrate , and blueberry flavor . Nothing is cooked or processed . But for all of its positive qualities , I could only eat one bite before throwing the rest away . Unfortunately , the blueberry flavor is only minimal . It was like eating soggy , mushy mixed nuts without salt . Though it seems healthy for you , I ca n't recommend this product based on its taste and consistency .	-1
I got excited about these but upon tasting all the flavors and reading the labels , not so much . They are mostly dates and all taste the same , good at first , but you get tired of them quickly .	-1
I was looking forward to trying and was hoping I would love a new organic snack product but was very disappointed with the texture and size of the product . The bar was too wet and soft for me . It was n't wet like a fig newton but like double the moisture content at least . You can actually see and feel how wet this organic bar is . The flavor was a bit bland ( depending where you bit ) and nothing special that I would look for again especially after being turned off by the soft consistency and high moisture content of the bar . There were bursts of blueberry flavor within areas of the bar , some nutty texture , but am not sure ( by view or mouthfeel ) what else was in there . I was n't even sure what kinds of nuts were in the bar while I ate it . The only way I 'd know what was in there besides blueberries was by reading the label . The bar itself looked like some kind of brownish/greyish wet clay square.Some may like it because of the natural products but I can not see myself trying this again , even if free .	-1
Looks like I was not the only one who got a bar with rancid nuts . I took two bites and could not finish it . The only thing that saved it from one star was that I could actually taste the sour cherries . It 's a dense , moist bar with soggy nuts . Not sure if I would give this another chance .	-1
I have to preface this by saying I 'm not a nut person . Unfortunately , I did n't realize this was going to have so many nuts in it . I just saw that it was blueberry and did n't realize it would taste more like nuts than blueberries . It 's very similar to Clif Nectar bars in taste and consistency . I did like that it 's all raw and has all organic ingredients . I also thought that the sweetness-level was perfect . Not too sweet and not too bland . If you like nut-heavy raw food bars , I think you 'll really like this . If , like me , you prefer something less nutty , skip this one .	-1
Every few years there is always a new fad , ruse and/or gimmick for food . Some of these `` marketing schemes '' are , but not limited to , food being `` light '' , `` fat free '' , `` 100 calorie serving '' , `` low carb '' , `` sugar free '' and in this case `` organic '' . I must admit , I like to be very aware about what kind of food I am eating . Cognizance and cuisine should be a given when making a wise choice about not only eating food , but what type of food.This is an organic raw fruit and nut bar by Pure , the flavor is `` cherry cashew '' . The first thing I noticed when I opened the wrapper is the bar is n't very appetizing . It looks like a small burnt fruit cake that was moist . As for the taste , I found it to be very tart . There is also this very acerbic aftertaste . As for the texture , it was chewy and I felt like I had powder in my mouth . I realize this is a `` raw '' and `` organic '' fruit bar , but come on . If that was n't enough , this bar is 190 calories and 8 grams of total fat , this fruit bar is small . I suppose in this case organic does n't equal `` figure friendly '' or `` low in fat '' .Overall , I did n't even finish the bar . I ate maybe half of it . I can appreciate what Pure is doing by making and marketing an organic fruit bar ; in contrast , when eating food taste is still paramount . I also think that unneeded calories and high fat content should n't be disguised as `` organic '' . Which leads me to believe how `` organic '' is this food product ... ?	-1
I do n't like nuts in my brownies , so this was n't going to be for me . I did n't really like it . It 's a dense bar though - you get quite a bit . So I tried it on my family . My wife says she 'd probably buy it , so I guess she liked it . She said it 's very natural ( I agree ) . My 6-year-old did n't care for it , and my 2-year-old thought it was chocolate so he was a little ticked when it turned out otherwise . So 1 out of 4 for our family approves .	-1
I 'm a raw food person , and when I tried this bar , it tasted pretty yucky - kind of cardboard-y ! Not much flavor , and the texture of big soggy walnuts . It 's not very big either , but has 190 calories in each bar ! It looks like it has a lot of nutritious stuff in it , but if I 'm going to take in 190 calories as a snack , I want something yummy and filling ! If you do n't mind making your own bars , the best I 've had are from a recipe in Matthew Kenney 's Everyday Raw .	-1
This bar has so much going for it . I loved how soft it was and the texture was great . I just personally did not care for the taste at all . Even with all the healthy goodness I could n't force myself to finish the bar .	-1
I hate to give poor reviews but I have to say , I would not buy these . The blueberry bar was dry , dense and not very flavorful . The texture was grainy . It was NOT moist . I like granola bars , fig newtons , all of that stuff . I also like flavor . I did n't care for it and would not recommend it , to be blunt . Not much else to say . The wrapper was pretty , it was well sealed in a foil-type packaging , but the first bite was disappointing and not to my taste at all .	-1
This raw fruit and nut bar is rather gluey in texture and has no particular taste except sweet . There are 190 calories per bar of which 70 are from fat . The foil wrapper has a rather scary warning printed on it that the bar may contain pieces of nuts , shells , stems , or pits .	-1
When I want a snack , I do n't care if it 's good for me . I just want it to taste good . I tried this bar because I like cherries , and I like nuts . I figured we were off to a pretty good start right there . I was wrong.The number one ingredient on the lable turned out to be dates . Dates ? Yep . Dates . Apparently the dates and some rice protien makes up the soft-cookie-like , chewy base . I shared the bar with a friend , and I thought the base was mostly flavorless , but she thought it tasted like prunes.While the label says `` cashew '' , there are also walnuts and almonds in the bar . I thought the walnut taste overwhelmed the cashew taste , but that could be because I 'm sensitive to walnuts . My throat tingled for an hour after eating the bar . Someone with a more severe walnut allergy might have great issue with a cashew bar that has walnuts in it.The cherries were tart , but there were so few in the bar that it was possible to take a bite and not get any cherries . Perhaps they should have infused the date/rice protien base with some cherry juice to get some more flavor in the bar.I suppose if you 're used to eating flavorless things like rice cakes and unsalted granolla this might be a nice bar for a snack . But if you eat like a normal person , this bar is just something to gnaw on . It 's not a very satisfying snack at all.As I swallow , I 'm reminded to recount one important point I learned trying this bar : Absolutely stay away from it if you 're allergic to walnuts .	-1
The ingredients are impressive and all ... but the bottom line is ... they taste badly.. Too bad ! !	-1
I have been a licorice lover most of my life , but combining a mint flavor with licorice does not work for me . I have a case of this stuff I have to eat ...	-1
I love Panda regular black licorice but grabbed this one by mistake at the grocery store . Blek ... I had to throw the box away after managing to eat half . Licorice has a strong flavor but the herbs in this formula make you forget there 's any licorice in it .	-1
This has been my number one all time favorite candy for years but I wo n't be buying it again . They 've changed the formulation and it 's no longer any good . I 'm sure the change was dollar motivated and , guess what , they wo n't be getting any more of MY dollars .	-1
Yuck , they really messed it up when they changed the recipe . These taste like solid molasses bars , hardly any licorice flavor at all ! ! !	-1
Because that 's what it tastes like . Seriously , this licorice is awful.It is sticky . Some licorice you can hold between your fingers and pop into your mouth . Not this stuff . And heaven-forbid you get it near an angora sweater.I also find the texture vaguely unpleasant . Some reviewers appreciated the softness of the product . To me it just felt characterless and mushy in my mouth . Not completely unpleasant , but not pleasant.But more important than the tactile feel of the confection is the taste . And it gets worse with every bite ! I 've had some food items that tasted unusual at first , but got better and better the more I ate . Not Tire Tread licorice . Every bite has me sinking further into the taste of the manufacturing of vulcanized rubber.I do n't think this candy 's problem is too much of a licorice taste . I 've had various licorice products from Europe and Asia . No , the candy has a vaguely dirty taste , like it 's been tooling down the road before hopping in my mouth .	-1
My wife mentioned she missed the old black licorice bars that used to be around when we were kids . I found these on line and ordered a case of them because of the good reviews . Neither one of us , or any of the three other people who tried them could get past the first bite - the flavor is just too intense .	-1
For some reason I thought this was a popcorn product . It is ok but not fantastic ... the taste is mediocre . Not much bang for the buck .	-1
Yeast extract , one of the ingredients , is code for MSG . Go to truthinlabeling.com to get the low down on how it 's legal for macdougalls to do this.Sneaky , but legal ... Makes the entire macdougalls line suspect . They should be open about the addition of MSG . It makes many people sick . So depressing to see this in a `` health food '' . This is why they ca n't advertise `` no MSG '' on the label or in their advertising ... Get it ?	-1
so nasty ... the taste was like having herpes.. ewwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwhahahah , lOLnasty , toilet , garbage , this product should not even exist ... it 's so nasty .	-1
While the nutritional value of this vegan soup is excellent ( only 2 grams of fat per cup and just 4 grams of sugar ) , the mixture falls flat . The lime and black bean taste is adequate , but when mixed with hot water , the beans turn to a nasty sludge-like mixture . The texture is like paste and not very palatable . I tried the lighter McDouglall 's Tortilla Soup and was more satisfied with its ' aromatic smell and flavor .	-1
When I poured boiling water into the cup , the & # 34 ; bean stuff & # 34 ; clumped up and became a gloppy chunk impossible to eat . After transferring it to another bowl and pulling out a knife to cut the clumps down to size , I finally was able to eat it . Taste was good but not worth the effort . Not as good as the Doc 's other products for sure	-1
Since a company bought Rightfoods from Dr. McDougall , the quality has gone downhill . If you read the product labels , you 'll notice that there 's virtually no mention of `` organic '' ingredients anymore . I 've noticed that the basic ingredients often smell stale , and that the various cups do n't have the same flavor that they used to.The bottom line is that the overall product quality had gone downhill , in my opinion . I can no longer recommend Rightfoods .	-1
I bought these soups not realizing the following -- the soup cup is two servings -- -that means that this is 340 calories and a whopping 660 mg of sodium . I guess you could eat half the container , but what do you do with the rest ? Despite this ( hey , I bought it ... ) , I made the soup and was unimpressed . It tasted salty and stale . I have had other dehydrated soup cups ( great for traveling ) and this is by far one of the worst ones that I have had . Too many calories , too salty and too complicated to make ( you just do n't pour in boiling water and wait a couple of minutes ) . I find that the Nile Spice soups are better and certainly less fattening.I am a bit surprised that Dr. McDougall would create a product like this . I thought it would be more healthful !	-1
Would not buy this again . It is kind of pricey and has an off flavor . I have been vegetarian for over 20 years so it is not that I expected it to taste meaty but instead it had a strange taste I did not care for .	-1
Some of the Dr McDougall line of instant cups of soup or noodles and the like are really pretty good , but this one was disappointing . I hate to waste anything so I 'll mix it with some Nile rice pilaf or something like that until I 've used it up , but as a quick meal in itself , the good doctor should take this one back to the cooking lab and tweak the recipe a bit .	-1
On first glance this bread looks great , but tastewise is a whole different story . DRY DRY DRY , crumbly , and bland . I tried toasting it to see if that would improve tastes , but it just made it worse.I was hoping to find a good , affordable vegan product to have in the pantry but no such luck	-1
This stuff tastes horrid out of the package , and there are better option out there . We even tried using it for French Toast , but it was still barely edible . The only reason I 'd buy it again is to crumble it up if I needed breadcrumbs for a recipe .	-1
I ordered and when received , the size of the bread loaf surprised me , seemed so small , like a mini loaf of bread and yet the packing in not one , but two plastic wrappers ( one sleeve ) ( one compartment type ) seemed to a bit excessive . Then the first of the 6 loaves that I tried , seemed stale . I asked my room mate to taste it , and he confirmed , `` That bread is stale . '' That loaf was a little stale , but like my father , an omnivore , I ate it anyway . Toasted with butter , the first loaf of the six went like lightning . Gone ! I am still eating the bread , because the other loaves are not seeming that stale , actually , not stale at all , but I do not like having to throw away all this extra plastic that comes with each loaf and I do not like the little packets of `` Oxygen Absorber '' inside each loaf , that is marked toxic and `` keep away from children '' . Am I supposed to feel comfortable throwing that in the trash too ? I do n't feel comfortable about it at all.I will not be ordering this bread again , just because I do n't like the way it is packaged , like it 's Fort Knocks or something . And , being left to discard unwanted plastic and toxic `` oxygen absorbent '' ... I think I can find a better alternative , I 'm sure .	-1
tea was disappointing	-1
This is soooo false ! ! The box looks great and it is but the actual tea pot is smaller than my tea CUP ! ! It makes barely enough tea for one person .	-1
Based on the mostly positive reviews , I purchased it . Well , believe the negative reviews . The cheap ( think dollar store ) glass teapot WITHOUT strainer holds 18 ounces . Since I just received this yesterday , I only used one flower which failed to bloom and the tea flavor was not impressive . The concept is unique , but way too pricey for what you get . As for the bamboo box , it is pretty but not really sufficiently sturdy to store anything except very light weight items .	-1
The presentation was good , but I gave this as gifts last year and my sister who got one of the boxes said the tea is beautiful but tastes `` weedy '' rather than like real tea . I tried some and agree.Not sure if it was just a bad batch , or if we have discriminatory tastes . I usually drink Stash teas and my sister drinks Bigelow & CS teas .	-1
I ordered this because it was supposed to be very healthful . It is inedible , and I ca n't even figure out what to do with it . I looked online and still could n't figure out . I am well aware that cocoa nibs are healthful , but what use is that to me if I ca n't EAT them ?	-1
Confirmed Goji Berry causing severe nausia cramping and intestinal pain.I was introduced to goji berries during the summer as a friend I met had just opened a raw food cafe . His food NEVER ( I mean never ) gave me any problems it was all delicious and much of it was cacao and goji berries . He has very selective about his sources and does not trust many companies out there . ( His Goji comes from Sunfood ) When I returned home from Alaska I decided to try more superfoods and bought a trail mix by Navitas that was Goji , Cacao Nibs , and Cashews . That day I had a green shake for breakfast and a banana for a snack then just a pinch of Goji Berries afterwards . Within the hour I was writhing in pain and could n't imagine what it was.This pain is severe . I wanted to die . It lasted about twelve hours . Including vomiting and diarrheaNext day I had a big green salad for lunch and then feeling better grabbed another SMALL pinch of goji and within 20 minutes I was in the exact same pain . I knew then it was the goji and instantly typed `` goji stomach ache '' into google and found threads verifying it.I called my friend and told him about my reaction and he asked me if it was Navitas . I did n't recall and did n't have the bag on me but he said he bet 100 % it was them . He had similar reaction to their product and did hydrogen peroxide tests and found them to be rancid . Got home and verified his assertion.Again , I never had this problem before eating Goji from Sunfood , but this Navitas is killing me.BEWARE : Detox can be painful enough even on a quality Goji berry . You should start with very small amounts and I would recommend trying alternate brands NOT navitas .	-1
After eating some , I am now in full stomach distress . After googling this , I see others have the same issues with this brand of Goji Berries . I will not be purchasing anymore .	-1
I assumed that since these were USDA Certified Organic , they were , in fact , from the USA . Not so . In the tiniest of type on the back under the ingredients it says : PRODUCT OF CHINA . So now I do not believe they are raw or organic . So disappointed with the country of origin that I am going to try to get my money back .	-1
The taste is & # 34 ; different & # 34 ; but with the nutrition I was willing to give it a try . I mistakenly kept the berries in the same package , sealing with the seal provided on the package . All of the berries were as hard as a rock in a few days . I measured and added water to reconstitute them and for muffins and they were fine . But not for salads or eating like raisins . I recommend that you package in an air-tight container .	-1
I first heard about Goji berries on Dr. Oz , yep , another boost for Amazon by Dr . Oz. ! Anyway , initially I ordered the Healthworks organic brand in the 16oz bag and was very pleased with them . They were chewy and delicious and seemed very fresh ( similar to what you would expect when eating a raisin only slightly dryer ( consistency wise ) . I have to admit , at first I found them to taste a bit odd . Not sweet , not like a cranberry or a raisin but not quite as tart as a cherry . However , after a few days , they became addictive and grew on me . I decided to order more . For some reason I decided to shop around and see if I could find a cheaper alternative because , lets face it , $ 22.00 a pound , is n't cheap ! So I found Nativa 's which were a few dollars cheaper , so I ordered them . They arrived today and boy was that a mistake . They were dry and crunchy . The exp date on them was 2015 so i have no idea why they were so hard . Very disappointing . I called Amazon and they did issue me a refund . I went right back on Amazon and ordered the Healthworks Organic 16oz bag for $ 22 with free shipping and Amazon prime 2 day shipping . I did buy 2 bags but ordered the 16oz bags at the higher cost instead of ordering the 2lb bag at the cheaper price because I have found that sometimes the larger pound bags are n't as fresh .	-1
My wife is from China and she has told me many things , and I 've been there many times , and they poison they own babies ; I do not trust any food from China .	-1
I threw these away . They may be good chopped up or pulverized in a smoothie , but I did not like them right out of bag .	-1
To start with , I 'm a big fan of goji berries . A friend recommended another brand that I faithfully purchased until it was no longer available . I just found out it 's name and packaging have changed and I 've placed my order ! In the interim , I purchased the Navitas brand and have been disappointed . There were a number of green and dried leaves in the bag , which I never experienced with the `` other '' brand . I was about two-thirds of the way through my current bag when I discovered a couple of lovely little worms floating in my tea ! FYI , I usually start my morning off with a big cup of hot tea , sweetened with gojis . After seeing the additional protein in my tea I decided to check the remaining contents of the bag . I emptied it out onto a white paper towel and discovered a number of more white worms . The bag has been kept sealed and stored in a dry , cool area so I blame the product not how it was stored . I 'm very disappointed and will not be purchasing any more products from this company .	-1
I am NOT here to say there is something wrong with these Goji Berries or that they do not have an benefits . However , I added these to smoothies in the morning and found myself with SEVERE stomach cramps . It took me a couple days to realize it was the smoothing and these Gogi Berries that were new to my routine and the cause of the problem . Sure enough , a google search of several sites says & # 34 ; GOJI BERRIES CAN CAUSE STOMACH PROBLEMS IN SOME PEOPLE & # 34 ; and & # 34 ; GOGI BERRIES SHOULD NOT BE EATEN ON AN EMPTY STOMACH & # 34 ; . No where on the package does it give any warning , but the moment I stopped eating these I was cured . So please , if you have any pain , cramps , etc . after starting to consume these make sure they are not the cause of your problem .	-1
I 've never had Goji Berries before so I do n't know what to compare them to , but I did n't care for these . Initially , they have a nice flavor , but after a second or two a bitter after-note settles on your tongue and that 's not really my style . It 's not bad or horrible by any means , but it 's just not something I want to eat . It might be better mix in a muffin batter or tossed in some oatmeal , but I did n't even try . However , my ducks seem to love them .	-1
Eating Chinese food products is like playing Russian Roulette.I didnt know this was from PRC and will donate to a food bank .	-1
Sorry to have to write a negative review , but these are terrible . Much too dry , almost tastes like little rolled up pieces of paper . I tried mixing them in my yogurt , but they were still much too dry . Do n't waste your money on these . Buy Heaven Mountain brand , as they are the absolute best ! You wo n't believe the diffence , until you try them .	-1
I am on my second bag of Maca , taking 2 tablespoons each morning . I like its weird bitter flavor ( but then I like every vegetable on the planet , so do n't go by me as to flavor ) . My purpose in taking it was to alleviate a borderline slow thyroid ( medically diagnosed ) and symptoms of adrenal fatigue ( not officially diagnosed , but felt ) . Maca supposedly helps with endocrine functioning.However , I have not noticed any difference . It has not hurt me , but has not helped either . After reading the other reviews , perhaps I should stop and read more about it.Thanks to all commenters for sharing .	-1
Update : Today ( April 25 , 2014 ) I spoke with Luis Figuroa , customer service rep for Navitas . He told me the chemical in Maca is LEAD , and that the State of CA mandates whenever the concentration of lead is 0.5 mcg/day or greater , the warning notice is required . When questioned , he stated that Maca 's lead content is lower than this . But how could that be , if CA only requires a warning notice of birth defects , etc . if the concentration of lead is 0.5 mcg/day or greater ? Just does n't compute . He promised to send me an email explaining `` everything . '' This turned out to be a form letter from Zach Adelman , CEO and Founder of Navitas Naturals , stating the CA requirement , and saying it was much greater than the FDA 's threshold for lead-risk disclosure . Well , ok Zach , but what you do n't say is exactly what the mcg/day concentration of Lead in Maca actually is . You 'd think he 'd deal with this , but he totally ignores it . So we know it 's greater than 0.5 mcg/day , but how much greater ? And , if you think the FDA , which has a well-deserved reputation for being the 'Government 's Most Dysfunctional Agency , ' is protecting our health risks about lead , I have a bridge to sell you . A follow-up email to Navitas asking this very question has , as of this writing , gone unanswered . As I often say in my line of work `` big red flag . '' And , CA is a leading state , so I would n't discount their birth defect or other reproductive harm risk at greater than 0.5 mcg/day . Unless you 're a company trying to sell a lot of ( unhealthy ) product . Then , to make a buck , you try to down-play it.Update : April 28 , 2014 . Just received an email from another Navitas customer service person who just quotes the company spin : lead is naturally occurring and that their level ( which he does n't disclose ) is below the FDA threshold . If he believes the FDA , which has a well-deserved reputation for being the 'Government 's Most Dysfunctional Agency , ' is protecting our health risks about lead , I have another bridge to sell him . And `` everything occurring naturally is harmless '' is one of the most enduring myths of our times , A while later , I get an email from Luis Figuroa , customer service rep for Navitas , saying `` Our product specialist is out and expected to return at the end of this week . I have emailed your inquiry and he will be touching base when gets back in the office . I will follow up with you as soon as I get more information . `` Update : May 1 , 2014 . Sent an email to Luis , asking : Is there only one product specialist in your company ? Is he the only one in your company who knows the actual lead content in your Maca powder ? As of today ( May 3 , 2014 ) , no response from anyone at Navitas.Update : May 5 , 2014 Received an email from Arthur Mullin , Product Specialist at Navitas who stated `` Testing of our Raw Maca Powder showed a lead level of 0.42mcg per gram or 2mcg per serving . '' The serving size , per their package , is 1 teaspoon ( an incredibly small amount for any health-oriented person who is likely using a LOT more in their health drink , etc . ) But even at the miniscule 1 teaspoon , that works out to 300 % more than California 's threshold warning level of 0.5 mcg/day . Use a more realistic amount , just a tablespoon ( 15 grams ) , and you 're up to 6.3 mcg , or about 1,200 % more than California 's threshold warning level for lead . Arthur also mentioned it 's below the FDA 's recommended maximum limit , but as I mentioned above , if you think the FDA , which has a well-deserved reputation for being the 'Government 's Most Dysfunctional Agency , ' is protecting our health risks about lead , I have a bridge to sell you .	-1
I really wanted to like this . I love ramen noodles and these are so much better for you , but the taste is really bad . They need to revamp this product .	-1
I LOVE the chicken pilaf and tortilla soup by Dr. McDougall , but this `` ramen '' is horrible . The noodles are so mushy . There is nothing ramen about this soup . It tastes like mushy cardboard . I have put worse things in my mouth , so I 'm giving this 2 stars . It is still pretty disgusting though . Take this one out of your line of products , Dr. McDougall . Did you taste it before you approved it ? In a weird way , it is so bad that it makes me rethink my love of the pilaf and torilla soup .	-1
I love Pad Thai and had great expectations for this product . Unfortunately , it was a bust . However , the product is described as a soup , and that should have been a tip off , since Pad Thai is more of a spicy noodle dish than a soup . You wo n't find either the flavor or texture that you 'll find in real Pad Thai .	-1
I have had Pad Thai before ... And always liked it quite a bit . This kind , to me , is pretty disgusting . It 's nothing like any of it I 've had before . The noodles are weird and really short and the broth they 're in is gross . Although I really love some of the other Dr McDougall 's products , I would not recommend this one : (	-1
Watery , noodles are too short and not a good texture , and the flavor packet does n't seem to fuse well with the noodles , so you end up eating bland noodles with spicy flavorful water . I would pick the lentil soup .	-1
`` Fresh flavor '' -- do n't you believe it . This stuff is more like `` barely tastes like food . `` I was looking for a gluten free version of the cup o ' noodles products that are so tasty ( and so not good for you ! ) . This was n't it . I wo n't say that I had to choke it down , but it was n't very far from that . Out of an abundance of optimism , I 'll probably try one more flavor of Dr. McDougall 's cups -- this was the first I 'd tried -- but I 'm guessing that after that I 'll be done with this brand for good .	-1
I 'm not sure what part of this is supposed to be pad thai - the noodles are short and chewy and the flavor pack tastes mainly of salt . I know this is an instant product but I was expecting something that was vaguely close to Pad Thai rather than a bowl of hot water without much flavor . Although this is tagged as vegan , I suspect it 's not very healthy since I felt like drinking a gallon of water after eating this .	-1
I like several other Mcdougall 's soups for a quick lunch at work , but not this one . The noodles just did n't soften enough to be enjoyable . Perhaps it was my method , because I use a lower setting on the microwave . If I do n't , the water boils out over the cup . I will have to experiment on the rest of these and see if I can find the solution to uncooked noodles .	-1
Thin , not especially flavorful , and inconvenient to prepare . I ca n't understand the enthusiastic reviews for this product . I love Thai food and this was a disappointment .	-1
do n't follow the direction unless you like watery soup because that is what you 'll get . i used coconut milk and added peanut butter to make this `` soup '' tolerable . i did n't fill it to the line , i filled it half way , and that made it a saucy noodle cup instead of a game of find the noodles . not too bad , but not enough food in the cup to make it worth the price ... not even close .	-1
I have tried and enjoyed many Dr. McDougall instant soups , but this one is going to the trash can . I literally spit it back out . I love Pad Thai from Thai restaurants , but this was nowhere close to a real Pad Thai flavor . Skip this one .	-1
I am sure this is a fine product , but I just did not like the flavor . Same company produces pea soup and black bean soup , both of which are very tasty	-1
I liked Dr. McDougall 's split pea soup and his oatmeal , so I decided to try this.Oh man . I could not believe how disappointing this was . The ony PRO was that it was chock full of noodles . If you love rice noodles , the Asian style , this has oodles.But the flavor was lacking . So bland , it was like someone took the soup and watered it down and served noodles in saltyish water . It 's called Pad Thai soup , but as a pad thai afficionado , I ca n't say I noticed any resemblance to pad thai -- other than Asian noodles.If you like watery noodle soup , go for it.If you actually want a burst of Thai yumminess , this is not a soup I can recommend.Mir	-1
I 've never gave a bad review , but this one deserves one ! ! ! I can be stuck on an island and i rather starve to death then eat this piece of toilet taste food ! ! So nasty , I fed it to my dog ... they barked at me for 30 minutes straight . lolDo not buy it ! ! !	-1
Below average taste . Packaging tends to heat quickly and melts while noodles take awhile to get to the right temperature .	-1
I have n't this soup , but I was looking at the ingredients and there 's yeast extract ! ( a secret name for MSG ) It 's a neurotoxin ! Dr. M , I 've had a stroke , too . Should I be consuming brain toxins ? I became vegan for my health , to give my brain the best chance of recovery and you are going to sneak MSG into my food under the guise that it 's healthy ? It makes food taste good ; no doubt about that , but MSG is the easy way . Use spices . I 'll buy your products when it is truly healthy.For shame ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! !	-1
Second strike for Dr. McDougall 's . Love the pilaf and tortilla soup , hate the ramen and pad thai . So mushy , salty and disgusting with a weird chemical taste . I 'm so glad that my Publix carries the nearly complete line of Dr. McDougall 's products . I would kick my own butt for buying this product in bulk .	-1
I like the noodles themselves , and as has been written here before , they 're relatively plentiful for this sort of product . The killer for me is that the broth is fairly well pervaded with mushroom taste , which is a real turn-off , and IMHO anomalous for a product describe as miso-flavored . I 'm fortunate that a certain local Japanese place offers fish-free miso soup , but we also make it at home ( or use the Miso-cup instant ) . For noodle cups , I 'll stick with the chicken-flavor variety.Others have written complaining of salt and that the flavor does n't knock their socks off . I submit that this is the what you get in the dehydrated instant soup cup arena . Tasty volatiles by nature are n't going to be captured in a dry broth powder , so there 's only so good any product like this is going to be . If there was n't a fair amount of salt added , it would n't taste like much at all -- this is true of anyone 's soup cups.The tradeoff is that these are inexpensive , extremely lightweight , and last indefinitely on the shelf . I use them for late night snacks , and especially when I crew sail races -- the boat owner generally has various processed food items to offer , but they 're nearly always laden with animal products . I can throw a couple of these in my bag and when hot water is available , have something warm to put in my stomach when I 'd be otherwise limited to chips or such . The value of this is not to be underestimated when it 's 45 degrees and raining with 20 knot winds .	-1
Cheap gross does n't taste like miso or ramen its some weird gross hybrid . Not good . Not cup of noodle . Just yuck .	-1
I tried most of the Dr. McDougall vegan cup-o-soups and liked most of them , but the Miso flavored one I will not get again . It was so unsatisfactory that in order to use them at all I had to mix it with regular ramen packages to cut the flavor of bad miso . I usually love miso and really think the company needs to work on this one a bit more as it was n't even close .	-1
I love miso soup so I thought I 'd give this a try . The miso broth is wonderful , however the noodles are best described as wet cardboard - no matter how long they soak/cook . Too expensive as a broth alone . The redeeming feature is that they provide very few of the awful noodles .	-1
I 've tried several of Dr. McDougall 's products and typically find them tasty . This miso noodle soup however , is pretty nasty . The noodles are ramen , but not GOOD ramen . They are thin , flat , and have a strange aftertaste and texture . The flavor of the soup itself is n't miso , but a bland approximation of it . It tastes more like a watered down salty broth . There is n't much wakame , and a few more tiny chucks of tasteless tofu . This has been sitting in my cupboard for months and will continue to sit there until I run out of absolutely everything else . I 'd give it away , but I do n't want the recipient to be mad at me when they taste this stuff .	-1
This was my first Miso soup and I wasnt very impressed . The flavor is so light that it 's almost like eating unflavored noodles .	-1
I was very disappointed in this . The noodles had the flavor of cardboard..absolutely no `` miso '' soup taste at all and I love miso soup . It did have lots of chunks and good things so it looked appealing but no taste . I even checked the date for freshness but that was fine . Unfortunately I do n't recommend this one .	-1
EDIT 4-8-13 : Since Rightfoods was sold , the quality has gone downhill . Ingredients often smell and taste stale , I 've found stray packaging inside of food cups , the food often does n't taste right and overall does n't have the same flavor as it used to . I can only come to the conclusion that corners have been cut by the new company . I no longer recommend Rightfoods.All content below this line is no longer valid and is kept only for contrast to current conditions. -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -I 've been a McDougall customer since 2004 , and I 've tried almost all of the food cups . They are excellent for those who want a vegan , mostly-organic alternative , and of course one pays extra for the convenience and vegan/organic ingredients.The Miso-Ramen soup is good . When one opens the cup and removes the flavor packet , there 's a hockey-puck-shaped packet of noodles . That 's the way it 's supposed to look ; letting them seep in hot water as per directions will expand them normally . One gets a full cup of noodles as a result . The taste is good and somewhat true to Miso . The food is best eaten as is ; this is n't a cup that works well poured over pasta , rice , or a baked potato .	-1
I bought this product along with Dr. McDougall 's Tortilla Soup and Dr. McDougall 's Hot & Dr. McDougall 's Curry with Brown & Wild Rice Pilaf and I must say that I waste my money behind Dr. McDougall 's products . All three products I bought taste very awful and worst food I have ever ate so far . I have never experienced this kind of bad taste in my life . Now I going to throw out all 15 cups . if McDougall can give me money back I for sure return all my items .	-1
Did n't care for it but I think it is just personal taste . I liked the Split Pea & barley soup and the Black Bean w/ lime . Did n't care for the noodles they did n't seem to take on any flavor from the season . It was just like eating bland noodles ramon noodles in a season liquid but in order to taste the liquid you had to drink it .	-1
I 've eaten one of these so far , and one is more than enough . If this were the only food available , my weight would drop like a stone for not wanting to touch this stuff . My stomach 's ok with it - just my mouth is repulsed . Sorry I 'm not being more specific - I mostly just wanted to add my 2 stars worth.FYI , without the flavor packet , it smells like cooked eggs and does n't leave your teeth coated with gunk . I added a gallon or so of soy sauce and some fines herbes and managed to consume one more of them that way . But it 's still not safe from thoughts of trashing the rest ...	-1
Honestly this stuff is worse than cup o noodles , it has absolutely no flavor at all . I thought I would give this a try because my favorits is Simply Asia Brand Hot & Sour and it is a million times better . I suggest people dont waste their time on this , glad I only bought 6 .	-1
It is nothing special with a fairly bland taste for a fairly expensive cost compared to making my own oatmeal .	-1
This bread really , really is tasteless and ... not only that ... but it has a very strange texture and consistency . Put a small bite in your mouth and it instantly dissolves . Odd stuff . Ca n't imagine this being a good substitute for those who are gluten intolerant . Or ... maybe it 's just me .	-1
I tried this product when I was first diagnosed . It is palatable & has a nice storage life outside of a freezer . I much prefer Udi 's or Joan 's Great Bakes for bread . They really taste like bread . This is just barely edible .	-1
I was getting this with subscribe and save for just under fourteen dollars . It has been removed from subscribe and save and now they jacked the price to more than double ? ? ? I for one protest a company that can offer this bread at less than half this price and then just double the cost over night without notice , or reason . I am tired of supporting greed and will switch to something else .	-1
This bread was not good : ( It was really dry and tasted like cardboard . I would suggest Bobs Redmill breads - they are the best I have found that are gluten free .	-1
This bread ... traumatized me . I did n't realize how bad gluten free bread could be until I tried this . The fact that it was vacuumed sealed with an insane shelf life should have told me something . Just touching it to get a piece out told me this 'bread ' was gon na be bad . I had no idea how bad it would really be though . I took a small bite and immediately felt it disingrate into what felt like sand in my mouth . Bitter sand . There are so many better options out there , that this should n't even be an option .	-1
I was recently diagnosed as being gluten-intolerant so I decided to buy a case of this bread based on the reviews . I almost gagged on this bread -- it was simply terrible . I have since found a gluten-free bread at Whole Foods by Udi 's which is fantastic and I will never buy this Ener-G Foods Light Brown Rice Loaf again . What a waster of money ! Do n't do it !	-1
Four of the six packs of buns were moldy when I recieved the order and had to be thrown away .	-1
Even when heating these they taste horrible . Mine arrived already dried out . When removing them from the package they were cracked and crumbly . My sons who are Celiacs almost cried . They miss hamburger buns so badly and I thought with the reviews I saw that these were the answer for them.Both are six years old and both practically gagged on the texture and taste.. all around just plain bad . Even our dog would n't eat them and he eats just about everything.. he sniffed them and walked away.. That says it all right there .	-1
This was the first hamburger bun we found after our celiac diagnosis . Comes unsliced , was very hard to cut through . They were very dry and too bready . To be able to eat them at all , we had to wrap them in wet towels and heat/microwave ... and eat FAST as they harden up quickly . No way you can toast them or grill them and have them not come out hard as a rock ! Not much flavor either . The size is better than the tastier Schar brand we 've found since though , actually is the right size for a regular burger patty .	-1
Yuck . Extra extra hard , bad flavor , leave a weird feeling & flavor in my mouth , and almost no salt.Find another gluten free pretzel , there are really good ones out there !	-1
I 'm all for reduced-salt , but no-salt is just nasty . I love sesame seeds so I was really eager to try these , but blech . They are also too hard not crispy - Glutino 's pretzels are much better .	-1
These berries are not sweet at all and take a bit getting used to . My family members do not like them but you do n't have to worry about overeating them ! I have n't tried baking with them yet , but it might help to put them with a sweetened cookie dough .	-1
No I really like these products but this one was so bad . I forced myself to eat it for a week . I did not want to waste my money . But after a week of these chucks of what are supposed to apple in my mouth I could not do it anymore . I ended up giving the other boxes away and hopefully they found them to be better tasting then I did .	-1
I bought this product along with Dr. McDougall 's Tortilla Soup and Dr. McDougall 's Hot & Sour Noodle Soup and I must say that I waste my money behind Dr. McDougall 's products . All three products I bought taste very awful and worst food I have ever ate so far . I have never experienced this kind of bad taste in my life . Now I going to throw out all 15 cups . if McDougall can give me money back I for sure return all my items .	-1
i hope people do n't think this is what vegan food is supposed to taste like . BLEHHHHHHHHHHHHHH THAT 'S BLAND ! there are many many other good microwaveable vegan meals out there , do n't eat these because you expect health food to be gross . believe me , these are overpriced and underseasoned ... try annie chun	-1
This & # 34 ; soup & # 34 ; tasted like the cardboard cup it was sent in . Wow - could n't believe the nothingness that was on my tongueNot doing this again -- -	-1
I 've been following the McDougall/Esselstyn plant based diet . The results have been great - massive weight loss , lower cholesterol , etc.As part of that plan I 've cut out a lot of salt . This product has HIGH SODIUM . I was shocked when I read the numbers . Had Dr. McDougall sold out ? I thought I 'd be safe ordering any product he sells . I was wrong . I wo n't eat this and have wasted my money .	-1
I was so excited to get these vegan soups . The packaging is so deceiving with a name like Dr. McDougall and vegan . Unfortunately I did n't read the other reviews before purchasing like I usually do . And I read the ingredient label after they arrived . They have MSG aka `` yeast extract '' and `` natural flavors and can not be returned according to Amazons return policy . Waste of my hard earned money . Lesson learned !	-1
I love pea soup , so it seemed like a no brainer to buy this . I mean seems like a good buy , easy to make and no hassle cleanup , right ? WRONG ! This stuff is so gross . I followed the instructions to a T and the stuff was gross and had the weirdest consistency of any soup I 've ever had . I 'm only lucky I bought this using a $ 5 Amazon gift card I had , otherwise I would have been out $ 10 of my own money instead of just $ 5.Bleh , the smell is pretty gross too , its still lingering in my kitchen . Think I 'll just give these to my health freak friend , she 'll eat anything so long as its organic and vegan , no matter how crappy it tastes .	-1
This stuff does taste good and is convenient to prepare . The downside is that the nutritional info applies to HALF the container . Who would eat half ? When you read the specs and double the numbers , it just is n't that healthy . When you eat all the product , you are consuming a lot of calories , carbs , sugar and sodium ... way too much for one meal . Also , a breakfast high in protein is much more beneficial.As an aside , I have never understood why manufacturers do this serving size deception . I am sure there are adults out there who eat half a can of soup or half a breakfast cereal cup ; but when most adults have soup for lunch , they prepare and eat all the soup , and likewise with this product for breakfast.There are worse choices , but better ones as well .	-1
I 've tried eating this a few times over the years , but always seem to have an allergic reaction to it . Also , it has an odd sweet taste that is unappealing .	-1
I have to eat a gluten free diet and thought this would be great , i can have bread again . I have to admit the taste was not bad at all but the texture was gross it was dry and gritty . Was like stale bread and when you bit in to it felt like you had sand in your mouth , i couldnt stand eating it .	-1
Just starting out on the GFCF diet for my autistic daughter . She was so excited to see me unwrap this ( it looks like bread ! ! ) . I had tasted it beforehand and had reservations about whether it was even edible . She took one bite , spit it out , and handed it back to me . DH asked `` how bad could it be ? '' . Came home , tried it , and he stuck it in the garbage bin . Yuck .	-1
These were okay . I did n't like that they were n't presliced . They were VERY thick & heavy . My daughter liked them for the novelty of eating a bun again ... but finished the hotdog by itsself after trying half of this.. ( She threw the rest away . ) You have to microwave or cook these first . They were more trouble than they were worth.I wish they 'd make them with the same recipe as their `` light '' white rice bread loaf ... they 'd probably be really good ...	-1
My family is gluten intolerant . Was hoping for a roll that replaces the good old one made from wheat flour . Has the same shape - albeit larger - but the bread overpowers the taste of a hot dog..I did find that if you remove most of the inside part of the bun and put in two hotdogs that the taste improves and its not so `` bready '' . Was not overly impressed but since we can not eat wheat this so far is the best I 've found . `` in the valley of the blind , the one eyed man is king '' .	-1
I bought this product along with Dr. McDougall 's Right Foods Vegan Curry with Brown & Wild Rice Pilaf and Dr. McDougall 's Hot & Sour Noodle Soup and I must say that I waste my money behind Dr. McDougall 's products . All three products I bought taste very awful and worst food I have ever ate so far . I have never experienced this kind of bad taste in my life . Now I going to throw out all 15 cups . if McDougall can give me money back I for sure return all my items .	-1
Ok , not my fave , enjoyed some of the other flavors more . I can pass on this one . You may like it though .	-1
I am not a vegan but I wanted to try these to see if they 'd be good in a pinch . I opened the cup , then opened and added the spice packet , added 1 1/3 cups of boiling turkey broth and stirred it thoroughly for at least 20 seconds . Then let it sit for 6 minutes . Then stirred again thoroughly . I detected the same strange flavors that other posters on here had mentioned . I detect the lime , yes , but there 's also another undercurrent taste that tastes to me like soap . It is not pleasant . Some of the rice and other ingredients remained hard . As many people on here that have complained about soggy tortilla chips , and considering the spice packet is in its own package aside from the cup , it 's a no brainer that they should put the tortilla chips in its own package as well . Would I eat this if I was starving ? Yes . But until then , a resounding no until the following problems are fixed : To fix these problems : 1 . Put tortilla chips in its own dedicated pouch to add after cooking . 2 . Get rid of the rice as much of it remained uncooked and add more beans.3 . Add less lime.4 . Get rid of whatever is causing that soap flavor .	-1
I take these to work for breakfast & lunch , and I love the Lentil Couscous & Split Pea ones so much that I figured I would give this one a try ... I will not be ordering it again . It is okay , but kind of bland , even with crushed red pepper added , and the rice is weird to me . It also has kind of a fake lime flavor , which I do n't really like . I am pretty bummed out about it because I really would love to find a great vegan tortilla soup . Oh well .	-1
I was really hoping that I would love this soup but unfortunately I just did not like it . That 's not to say that other 's would n't like it , this is just me .	-1
I am a vegan who cooks with no oil so Dr McDougall is a hero of mine . This soup was very bad . This was a big waste of money . The taste was bland and it had a weird aftertaste . The `` chips were soggy and weird . I would not purchase this again .	-1
I would not order again . It lacks flavor and was mushy in texture . I had to add salt and hot sauce .	-1
I bought this particular soup because I 'd tasted and enjoyed [ very much ] the black bean and split pea soup . This one was a disappointment . It was a little too watery , which I suppose could be solved by not adding the required amount of water , but I did n't care for the taste either . It was bland and the texture was too hard . The little bits of vegetable were too hard even after soaking longer than required .	-1
I am giving this 2 stars because some people like bland food , but for me it has no flavor . I loaded it with hot sauce and it still did not help it out at all , lol ! If you are diabetic or do n't eat much salt this will be for you~ : )	-1
not great , but that 's my opinion , some might like it more than I did . It did have a lot of beans , and was filling	-1
Simply put , this flavor does n't do it for me . Think I 'll just stick with the Chicken Ramen Cups and the Hot & Sour Ramen Cups -- they are among my favorite flavors . 'Nuff said .	-1

It can be eaten as is or poured over pasta , rice , a baked potato , etc .	-1
I bought 2 varieties of Dr McDougall 's dried soups , the black bean and lime , and the tamale . The tamale soup is crazy gritty and gross . You can let it sit and rehydrate as long as you want and stir forever , and it is still like eating a mouthfull of tortilla chip flavored sand . I went back to the bean soup just to make sure my stirring technique was correct , then tried one more of the tamale . Nope , still gritty and gross . If you can get past that though , the flavor is alright . My boyfriend 's son tried it too . I found it in the fridge with one spoonful missing . He said he put it in there `` in case anyone else wanted it '' . Yeah right . Straight into the garbage .	-1
I have tried a lot of these soups and this one is the worst I 've had . Not much flavor and the texture is not appealing either . Basically it fails as food .	-1
not one of my favorites though the other soups are better and I like them.. Maybe some would like it .	-1
I like several of Dr. McDougall 's items , but not this one . Do n't waste your money . Try one of his other soups instead , like the split pea or minestrone .	-1
FIRST TIME I ORDERED THIS DRY SOUP , TASTE WAS NOT GOOD TO ME , WILL NOT ORDER THIS ONE AGAIN -- THOUGHT IT WOULD BE VERY TASTY , BUT WAS N'T	-1
The soup is okay . It would be much better without the chips . They have an odd flavor and they mush up with the rest of the soup . I wo n't order this one again .	-1
Was a good product in theory but the oatmeal was flavorless , the fruits were ok , and it contained hard chunks that would not soften even after reheating it for an extra 1 minute.Seriously not worth buying but i do recommend the black bean soup . It kicks ass .	-1
Did n't not like this at all . Did n't taste good and we hated it so much that we threw all of them in the trash . I do n't recommend at all . I rather stick with the old fashion oatmeal . It comes out just right .	-1
I hated this . I like Dr McDougall 's items usually so maybe I am just not an oatmeal lover or something ( I do usually eat it a specific kind of oatmeal a specific way ) but I did n't care for this at all .	-1
If you love peaches , you 'll love this food cup . I like peaches , but the peach taste is too strong , and it was a bit too bitter . I gave them to my sister , and she ended up throwing them away .	-1
Come on Amazon , give me a break . Powdered tofu ? Get in some real food and I 'll buy more from you . I went looking for table sugar . You 've got 100 weird kinds of sugar ( that you expect me to buy in bulk ! ) but NO just plain sugar . I 'm not eatin ' any more of this rice and tofu bread either.Sorry I just had to rant .	-1
These english muffins are okay at best . They are very hard to cut and break apart easily making it hard to toast . They definitely have to have something like jelly or peanut butter spread on them otherwise , do not taste the best .	-1
I had high expectations upon purchasing this tea . I am sorely disappointed . The tea is practically raw green and not semi-fermented as oolong should be , tastes like grass ( minus the gr ) , bitter , weak , pale yellow at best and not the promised copper color when prepared as per directions ( or even stronger ) .Simply awful compared to other fine teas I have tried . Even Red Rose Decaf teabags taste spectacular compared to this stuff which tastes like straw at best.Total waste of money .	-1
I found this Numi Tea overpriced for it 's quality and taste.Just regular twinnings kind of quality tea dust.Elaine Newman , tea drinker	-1
I enjoy Numi rose white tea which tastes wonderful . However , the green tea tastes smokey and not very reminiscent of verdant tea leaves . At least the tea is organic and fair trade .	-1
Do n't get me wrong , the bars taste good , but golly gee whiz they are so hard I am afraid I 'll break a tooth . I cancelled my order for this reason .	-1
I have no complaint about the bar themselves , but they are too expensive for what you get .	-1
These beans taste good and are pretty easy to prepare . Salt content is too high . The real problem is that the vendor may have become a bit too greedy and raised the price significantly . At around $ 16 bucks , they seemed to be an ok deal . Now that they 're nearly $ 20 , I 'm not so sure . I could buy 25 cans of 79 cent refried beans for $ 20 that do n't need reconstituting , have less salt , and work just as well .	-1
Updated review September 2012 ... .This reformulated product is longer appropriate for low carb diets . I called Kellogg to complain and got sympathy as the agent said she is diabetic but I have heard nothing since although she did take my email and snail mail address -- not even a coupon ! Do n't buy this cereal !	-1
I am very disappointed and scared . I love this rice , I love the flavor and the convenience of this product . However , the forth bowl I cooked in the microwave had a piece of `` GLASS '' in it ! ! ! Now I am afraid to eat the rest . I am lucky I did not swallow it ! ! ! I heard a crunch when I was chewing and spit it out . To my dismay it was a piece of clear glass ! ! ! How the **** did a piece of glass get into the rice . I would really like someone to cantact me regarding this . I would contact the product maker , but am not sure how to go about doing that .	-1
I reheated this out of the plastic bowl -- and even reheated in a ceramic bowl , it tastes like , and smells like , plastic ; it leaves a bitter/sour plastic aftertaste for quite a while after it 's eaten.Scaree .	-1
I have opened 6 cans now . Each is primarily water with tiny , shredded bits of chicken meat floating in fluid . Sorry , but if you own a cat that 's probably where you 'll donate this product . It is so watery you can shake the cans and they sound like there 's nothing in them but fluid . This was an expensive disappointment .	-1
The contents are mostly water , very little chicken ( rip off ) . The chicken tastes good , but not great.I would not recommend it to anyone due to the price and small amount of meat contained in the cans .	-1
This should be called mush in a can . Why is the low sodium version so unrecognizable , grainy and mushy without the chunk qualities you expect when opening canned chicken . I need low sodium fast lunch solutions and was hoping this would help . What a rip off , it looks like they canned the leftover dredges from their premium breast of chicken and slapped a low sodium label on it . Shame on you Hormel ! !	-1
I was looking forward to this lycorice candy . Unfortunately they are not only licorice . They also contain ANISE and they taste much more of anise than of licorice . Called Amazon for a refund based on the fact that nowhere does it say the product contains anise . If I had known , I would n't have ordered . Fortunately , Amazon has the BEST refund and return policy in the world .	-1
Wish I could upload photos for this product , but amazon has n't enable that feature on this product . The problem is with the tin cans they come in , all four corners have paint flaking off onto the candies . Hopefully its nontoxic paint ... I have sent off an email to xylitolusa with pictures . Hopefully they will not only change the tins , but also the flavor , they are way to sweet and weak on the licorice flavoring . These are n't mints , so they dissolve almost instantly in your mouth .	-1
These are absolutely full fat and quite unnecessarily so ( the fat does n't make them yummier as in `` what a treat '' but decidedly uckier , imo ) . I 'd much rather splurge on something else for my fat . These two-serving bags come to almost 300 calories with very little protein . If the bags truly came in one-serving sizes and were cheaper , I might actually buy a smaller amount of them again someday . But I 've had these bags for a few months already , and even though I have more than six months before expiration , I imagine I 'll be looking for ways to give some away . This has been my biggest [ ... ] grocery disappointment . I only give them two stars instead of one because for some shoppers the main point really may be adding fiber to your diet with calories and fat counting little . And maybe you would naturally gravitate toward full fat plain tortilla chips . If so , maybe this is a snack for you and a better option than your regular full-fat tortillas .	-1
The texture of these chips is good . They have a great crunch , buy have almost a bitter taste . I wo n't be back for more	-1
I 'm trying to be creative with this rice because i did n't like it . Not the texture and not the taste . It 's very bland , and it is sticky and chewy . ehh ... just not my taste .	-1
The first bowl of this had gone bad . If the other bowls are better , I 'll update and let you know .	-1
I bought these and have eaten them topped with a Teriyaki sauce or a chicken cream sauce . There 's no way you can serve this as a side dish by itself . It would be just a solid clump . You ca n't take a few kernels onto your fork . If you place your fork into them , you 'll get the whole pile when you pick up the fork . The texture is very gummy and it does have a weird taste . Not like any other brown rice in the supermarket . The rice is roundish and plump and goupey . Almost like little balls of squish . It 's a little disturbing so I wo n't purchase again . Too bad , because it sure is convenient .	-1
Microwaved or stove-top , it does n't really matter . It comes out dry , sticky and tasteless . Tried putting seasonings on it but it does n't help . Would not recommend this to anyone .	-1
I bought a case of these to give to my daughter but they never turn out right . Always too burnt , or not cooked properly .	-1
I have had two cans of this stuff and both time i had stomach ache minutes after i finished eating it . The chicken taste good but for whatever reason i get stomach ache from it so beware about that	-1
man ... i expect a lot more from these cans with exchange for my 30 bucks.This stuff tastes as salty as you can think . The texture is `` great '' if you know what I mean..Look for something else.Low delivery speed as well ... bc no one order this stuff like me ...	-1
I bought this product to see if it would be useful for preparing meals for one . I used it to make an egg noodle , chicken , cream sauce dish . The can size was just about the proper amount of chicken for my dish . Was able to make a nice single serve entree . To bad the chicken was about tasteless . Parts of the chicken contents were tough and stringy . I think the 'fat free ' processing caused the lack of taste . I gave a can of the chicken a ride in a food processor to make a chicken salad . Took a lot of seasoning and the addition of onion , pickle , etc . to produce any taste . The chicken just served as the carrier of the other ingredients.The cats are n't thrilled with it either.The shipping was prompt and the goods arrived damage free .	-1
My mom had ordered the plain Corazonas before which were extremely tasteless and salty ( no one would eat them ) , but I still kept up hope . I really liked that you could see the seeds on the chips- at least made me *feel* like I was eating healthy . I thought I 'd order the jalapeno which I was confident would be full of taste.They were not stale ! They were not crushed . They were edible , and did have seeds on them . But they were NOT tasty . Barely Any jalapeno taste ! Which became understandable once I checked ingredients to find 'jalapeno ' on the second last line of the ingredients ... they obviously did n't put much in it . These were in fact almost just like the plain ones . If you liked those , you 'll probably like these.Both me and my husband thought the chips were n't good , and everyone agreed they were way too salty ... especially when you get to the bottom of the bag ( I love salty snacks , but this was just too much ) . So now I 'm taking them to the potlucks we go to to get rid of them : - ) People will eat anything at potlucks.BTW , one of the potlucks , someone just loved them . He ate 3bags . I said `` Are n't they too salty for you ? '' He replied `` Yea but they 're so good ! '' He was also excited that you could see the seedy things on them . Just wanted to let you know there are people out there that like them ( maybe during the first few bags anyway ) . But there are also a lot ( like me and the rest of my family ) who find them too bland and salty.SUMMARY : - not flavorful ( very little jalapeno ) - too salty- better healthier alternatives out there- many dislike them- some love them	-1
While I like Dinty Moore 's beef stew , it seems that this is just one product of theirs that I just do n't like.The food is n't that appealing- the food was all pale & pasty looking , but looks can be deceiving when it comes to food , so I went ahead & got it anyway . C'mon ... ham & potatoes ! How can that be ruined ? I unfortunately got my answer- you ruin it by loading it up with tons & tons of grease . The first few bites of this were n't bad & I think that if I only had a small portion of it , it would n't be such a terrible thing . ( Hence the 2 stars rather than 1 star . ) I managed to struggle through the bowl ( I hate wasting food & had nothing else to eat ) , but shortly afterwards I just felt sick to my stomach.If you have either a cast iron stomach or you REALLY like food like this , then you 'll probably like it . Me ? This is just one DM product I 'll never be buying again ! !	-1
I received a case of these as a gift from a fellow Amazon customer and I can not imagine what the other reviewers were reviewing . This is a terrible product that is almost solid potatoes in a light gray sauce . There are few small ham fragments throughout and they have the texture of hamburger . Some of the other reviewers mentioned problems with their GI tract that made this product useful . Well , I have ulcerative colitis and there is no reason to resort to buying this product.I will be giving the case to charity . The gift included two other Dinty Moore products and I live in fear - afraid to taste them . Hormel products to include their & # 8220 ; Complete Meals & # 8221 ; are terrific and ready in 60 to 90 seconds . Try other Hormel products .	-1
Since these cans of Ham are supposedly almost fat free , I was surprised that I found so much fat on the periphery of the can . And it tastes like there is a salt shaker full of salt in each can too . All in all I find these Hormel Chunk Lean Ham to be a bit on the disgusting side . I will try using them for appetizers after adding onions , olives , chives , lots of pepper , celery , etc etc to try to smooth out the rather grosstaste onto crackers or roasted bread pieces . A strong overwhelming salt taste can be subdued but it really requires a lot of work and forethought . Do n't expect a delicious HAM taste to be present though . This is the first time I have tried these cans of lean ham but I will not be buying these again . I DO NOT recommend them to anyone !	-1
This tastes/looks like the C-rations my Dad used to bring home when I was a kid . AWFUL , SALTY crap . Ham flavored stuff , is more like it . I 'm sure people who are in the military would like it , but icky stuff .	-1
I think I had tried this before , realized it was weird , and then forgot and several years later , based on the good reviews , just tried it again.Honestly , I can not in good conscience recommend this product . It 's not Spam exactly ; but it 's not nice , flaked chunks of ham exactly either . I 'm not quite sure what the heck it is . When you open the can , there is a Spam-like clump of white-coated lumpy meat inside . You have to sort of pull/cut it apart to get it into pieces . Maybe this is what they used to call Head Cheese ? I think that is what this is , or something like that.It smells rather , like , & # 34 ; Warning ... .Warning ... . & # 34 ; But for the sake of my budget , I am going to finish using these up . I think it has a harsh , unappealing quality but if I did several things to doctor it I think I can make it doableI agree that this would be an excellent emergency food , since nobody else is going to want to fight you for it . : ) Okay ; I know I left a bit of a harsh review , but I felt some of the reviews were a bit glowing for what is a pretty low quality canned ham product . These things have their place .	-1
uggggg ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! on its own . but if combined it is OK. SAAALTY ! should have pull lid . try this fryed.not straight from the can .	-1
I ordered some xylitol and erythritol products from this company and found some of them had a very , very strange , foul smell . Kinda like mothballs . They get some of their products made in China ( the erythritol , apparently ) , so I called the company with my concerns , worried about possible contamination . I waited politely while the receptionist asked the CEO if I could have a refund just for the strange smelling items ( even though it is listed on the web site as refundable ) . She came back and said , yeah , they 'd take it back this once , but they would never accept another order from me again . Next she started to chastise me for ordering more than one of the same thing since I 'd never ordered from them before . ( Note : I only wanted a refund for the unopened bags of the item in question . I did not ask to return anything else in the order . ) I explained that I had ordered it before from another company , but she interrupted me to say that I should test one item from each new company before assuming the items are the same . Well , in chemistry class we 've learned that pure chemical substances should be the same , and it says as much on their own web site . While I was pointing this out , she hung up on me.I had ordered a wide variety of this companies products - xylitol , erythritol , candies , gums , etc . Some were ok , but the ones that had the bad smell had me worried . I was very surprised when they did not want to stand behind their product guarantee and told me not to order again when I was only returning the items that seemed to be defective . I have learned that some products are made in the US , but when I called I only inquired about the erythritol , which they themselves confirmed was made in China.NOW foods offers the same items that I have ordered and they smell and taste just as sweet as sugar . They are also available here on Amazon.com.Try them instead -- I am sticking with them from now on. -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- I ordered a wide variety of things , including this item : erythritol , xylitol , gum , candy , etc . It included this item and a lot of other things.-I asked only for money back on items I tried that were suspect as being defective , and then only for the items I had not opened.-I asked the manufacturer if the items were safe to consume , given the very odd odor some of them emitted . This was as a result of a legitimate concern.-I did not know at the time that only some products came from China -- the customer service rep did not make that distinction when I asked . I was therefore worried about all of them.-My review concerns primarily the customer service problems I had , as well as the concern with the origin of their products I had ordered in general.Personally I think it is odd that when I called to return a small part of a rather large order that the customer service rep did not want to honor the guaranteed refund posted on the web site . She literally chastised me for asking to return the items since I had ordered several of the same thing . How was I to know the substance would smell so badly ? She said I should have just ordered one . What difference does it make since I had only opened one ? The others were perfectly sealed . She said she would take them back after much ado , and then said they would never accept another order from me . ( Like I would anyway after that ) .This company should not post a guaranteed refund when they do n't mean it .	-1
Even if you cook them al-dente , they still turn to mush . Forget about reheating them , then you 're just asking for mush !	-1
I bought this thinking it would be nice to eat a spaghetti that was gluten free and not expensive . I bought a few packages because I always follow the package directions first , then I play with it if it 's not to my liking.Attempt 1 was like eating a gummy spaghetti noodle with a nasty after taste . I had to add sauce and butter to kill the taste.Attempt 2 was n't any better . It was still gummy and gluey like and the flavor was n't very good either.Attempt 3 was a little better in that the water did n't look like a gelatin style mess when we drained it but the noodles were chewy and I could n't finish the second bite.Attempt 4 was when I finally said no more `` pasta joy '' . I ended up trying to cook it by breaking the noodles in half first , thinking maybe it just is n't that great for cooking as long noodles . Oh no . I ended up having to take out clumps of noodles , tear them apart from each other and put them back in the pot . I gave up towards the end and just threw the clumps of noodles out . The texture was slimy , gummy and sticky and the aftertaste is still like pet food.If you are used to over cooked spaghetti drowned in sauce , I could see how this would be great ... But if you want something that tastes and acts like spaghetti , this is NOT it.I ca n't figure out how this got 5 stars . It was horrible in taste and texture and was nothing close to spaghetti . I bought Hodgkins Mills rice and flaxseed noodles and they are perfect in texture and taste . But I wo n't buy pasta joy again .	-1
This pasta has a nice taste , but is so starchy that it makes a mess when youcook it . I much prefer the brown rice pasta , cause it cooks better andretains it 's shape much better .	-1
These noodles are thicker than normal which is why the longer cooking time and claim to wo n't fall apart . I found they clumped together while cooking and I did n't care for the flavor . I much preferMrs . Leeper 's Pasta Organic , Rice Vegetable Twists , 12 Ounce Bags ( Pack of 12 )	-1
1 star because you only get a half a can of chicken ! I cut the lid off all the way , removed the lid , tipped the can 's ( did not press down on it drain out even more ) liquid contents into a bowl , ... there was only a half a can of chicken left . If I pressed down on that , who knows how much packed chicken is there , did n't care at that point ... knew I was n't getting anywhere near an actual can of chicken like the other white meat organic type I have bought . That brand has a full can of chicken with water added to top it off . If you tip the can , drain the liquid the can is still almost full.The taste is like any other canned chicken , but when you buy those maybe you get what you pay for.w/this brand half the money you are spending on it is paying for the added greasy chicken broth .	-1
I bought these at my local supermarket and I had to throw them away . You can feel a burnt oil taste , very disappointing .	-1
The chips were cut too thickly . I found a better product on here made by turbana that are actually made in columbia	-1
I was excited to receive these because of the good reviews , but was disappointed . Yes , they are salty , but that is the only discernible flavor . I will eat them , but they do not have the kind of flavor I was dreaming of .	-1
I heard all the hype about tinkyada pastas and did a taste test between the tinkyada brown rice spiral and the orgran rice spiral - also brown rice.My results were very disappointing.The tinkyada took like 20 minutes to cook , the orgran took 7 minutes.Tinkyada had a very gummy mouthfeel , the orgran spiral had a clean mouthfeel and a nice texture - after only 7 minutes in the water.I made the tinkyada pasta using both sets of cooking directions on the package , same result - very disappointing.Will I buy tinkyada again ? No !	-1
I find the texture of this , and most other brown rice pastas , to be really off-putting . There are much better alternative-grain pastas available , like quinoa .	-1
I hate to spoil all these 5stars ratings for this product , but I did not like these chips at all . My reason for buying these in the first place , without tasting them first , were the 5star ratings . I felt the chips were not crunchy enough , it did not have a cheesy flavor , it taste too much of garlic and bellpeppers.I even tasted a cucumber flavor . it has like a vegetable garden flavor to it . I gave all eleven bags away . I would have spent my money better , if I had purchase Doritos instead .	-1
I have been a huge fan of Altoids for years . I have enjoyed the peppermints , the apple sours , and even the tangerine sours . That is why I was so surprised at my reaction to these . They actually burned my mouth and made me gag . I ate only part of one and had to throw the rest away .	-1
I just purchased some of these mints at the store . They do n't have that great of a taste and they are n't strong at all until you bite into them , and then the mint flavor quickly disappears and does n't leave your mouth minty in the least bit . I do n't know where all these high reviews are coming from . They taste like cheap mints in my opinion . I 've had better .	-1
I 've been munching on these for about 2 weeks because the tin shows in nice big dark letters at the bottom of the lid `` Cinnamon '' . I 've recently been diagnosed with adult onset diabetes and read some urban legends that talked about the possible benefits of cinnamon helping to stabilize or lower blood sugar.One day I noticed in the lower left hand corner , in light gold lettering the words Artificially Flavored . Now , why would you need to `` artificially '' flavor a cinnamon mint ? So , I went on a search for the true ingredient . The first thing I noticed is that if I keep eating these I 'm going to need to switch to the diet version since the first ingredient ( and therefore the largest component ) is sugar . Not a substantial amount ( 10 calories in 3 pieces ) but still might as well cut it where I can.But then I move down the list and it does n't say anything about cinnamon as an ingredient . So , I like these but I ca n't find anywhere , on any website , that indicates that the `` artificial flavor '' has anything to do with cinnamon . I found one website that indicated that it also contain `` natural flavors '' but that 's a man-made laboratory generated flavor made from `` natural '' chemicals so I 'm not sure I 'm filled with confidence on that end if I do find that on the label.So , if anyone can tell me if the Cinnamon Altoids actually contains cinnamon I 'd appreciate it . Until then I guess I 'm stuck with sprinkling cinnamon ( the real stuff ) on my oatmeal in the mornings .	-1
After seeing the Altoids advertisement in Amazon and based on the many favorable reviews , I quickly ordered the 12 pack . When it arrived and I took the first mint in my mouth , the aroma and taste was n't what I expected . After the first mint , I felt a queasy feeling and quickly brushed my teeth and tongue to get rid of the lingering , nauseating taste , YUK ! The tin 's shelf life was less than a year and half from time of receipt : 14 Nov 2010 and the ingredients seemed okay : sugar , natural flavors , gum arabic and gelatin , but the freshness of the ingredients ? ? The mints in the tin were larger when compared to an aspirin or tylenol pill and the uniformity of mints shape were uneven giving suspect to faulty production quality control . The distributor was Callard and Browser of Chicago , but the source of production is unknown.If you like licorice candy and want to try ordering a 12 pack of Altoids Licorice mints from Amazon , I suggest to find a outlet where you can buy just one tine and sample it to determine that it meets your expectations in terms of value , taste , aroma , and after experience .	-1
These used to be so good and I used to buy them by the bunch but ever since they switched from Aspartame to Sucralose they are the grossest most disgusting thing out there . Nevermind I hate the taste of Sucralose But I am one of the few I guess where Sucralose makes me violently ill . The Wintergreen ones still are amazing though because they are using Aspartame still but I do n't see that lasting very long . Almost every sugar free product is switching to Sucralose .	-1
It 's nice that these are sugar free , but do n't eat too many . I did n't notice the warning on the bag that said this could cause loose stool . I did n't experience that , but I ate a bunch while I was mindlessly grazing one day and I had a horribly upset stomach and my mouth was burning . If it can make me feel like that , there must be ingredients in there I 'd rather not have .	-1
a couple will probably be okay , but it 's hard to stop at that because low carbers are starved for candy they can eat . If you can stop after a couple , product is fine , if you can not , you may have gastric distress . I do n't think the taste is worth the discomfort . Maybe one day they 'll be sweets ( besides low sugar dark chocolate ) we can eat , but for now , all we can do is hope ( and avoid the worse culprits ) . This candy is okay at 2 or 3 pieces per day , in my opinion . More than that you may be taking your stomach in your hands .	-1
I just received my order , unfortunately I ordered ( 6 ) . I am so disappointed . I only had 1/2 a bottle left of my old ( different ) brand and decided to order some more before I ran out . I ca n't believe I did n't check the details out on this before ordering as I do take the time , normally , to do my own research on things . Sort of messed up this time.Here 's the thing . This Wholesome Brand Organic Raw Blue Agave has 16 grams of sugar in one TBL ! I called the company and learned it is under 35 on the Glycemic Index ... .still high . The brand I had before had only 9 grams of sugar per TBL ( the lowest I 've found yet ) with a rating of 27 in the Glycemic Index and , according the the company 's website , it is never heated above 118 degrees.Now , I 'm stuck with 6 unopened bottles of this stuff and not sure what to do with it . My fault .	-1
I have had this on subscription for at least the last 2 years . When my last subscription order was sent there was something very off on the flavor.Each bottle had about a half inch of foam on top and had a very strong plastic or soapy taste . It 's hard to describe but it was so bad I was unable to use it . I contacted Amazon and they were great , sent out a new order right away but when I received the shipment it was as bad as the first . When I contacted Amazon again they refunded my purchase price and actually made this product unavailable while they checked in to it . I see it is available again but I never found out what the issue was.I figured it must have been a bad batch so I reordered and did get a new shipment last week , this time of the 2 44 oz bottles . It was just as bad . I contacted customer service and they were great and promptly refunded my money.I ended up ordering another very popular , but more expensive , brand . This 'other ' brand is much better . No problems at all .	-1
Yes , I know , I know , agave nectar is supposed to be the answer for for those seeking to address insulin issues , or on low-carb diets , or just want a healthy alternative to sugar , and even honey and maple syrup , let alone high fructose corn syrup and artificial sweeteners . Yes , I 've done the research , am personally interested in both organic and low glycemic index products , and used agave nectar for a couple of years myself , proudly serving it to my friends.Despite the great enthusiasm for agave nectar and the endless hype from folks who should know better , I hate to tell you , but it 's baloney -- a very successful and clever marketing campaign to promote a sweetener that 's no better for you , and very likely worse , than many of the other sweeteners it replaces.First , forget any mental image of a `` nectar '' naturally flowing from the majestic agave cactus ; this product is created in factories through a chemical refining process , much the same way as high fructose corn syrup , from the starchy root of the agave plant and is , in fact , a refined high frustose product stripped of any nutrient value . It has a higher fructose content than high frustose corn syrup . While high fructose agave `` nectar '' wo n't spike your blood sugar levels , the fructose in it will cause : mineral depletion , liver inflammation , hardening of the arteries , insulin resistance leading to diabetes , cardio-vascular disease , obesity , and may be toxic for use during pregnancy.If you think I 'm making this up or shilling for some manufacturer of a competing sweetener , just google `` agave fraud '' and see for yourself . I wish it were otherwise.On October 27 , 2009 , the Wall Street Journal reported : '' [ T ] he Glycemic Research Institute , a Washington , D.C. , laboratory , issued a warning Friday that diabetics experienced `` severe and dangerous side effects '' during testing of an agave nectar . `` The diabetics passed out on the floor and had to be taken to the hospital , '' says Ann de Wees Allen , chief of biomedical research at the lab . She declined to say how much of the product the diabetics consumed during the test , saying that would be disclosed after a complete analysis of the results ... .The lab has stopped testing agave on humans amid safety concerns . Also , Dr. Allen says the lab refused to test four other agave products after a chemical analysis it commissioned from another lab found they were mixed with high-fructose corn syrup , which was not disclosed on the label . She declined to name the brands . `` Wikipedia 's entry for agave notes : `` the extremely high percentage of fructose can be deleterious and can trigger fructose malabsorption , metabolic syndrome , hypertriglyceridemia , decreased glucose tolerance , hyperinsulinemia , and accelerated uric acid formation , '' citing : Basciano H , Federico L , Adeli K ( 2005 ) . `` Fructose , insulin resistance , and metabolic dyslipidemia '' .

There 's no way I could replace sugar with this stuff . It has an extra taste to it that 's pretty bad . I ended up throwing out all six bottles .	-1
When I first ordered this product a couple years ago , it was a light honey color ( as shown in their picture . The last two batches I received were an amber color and they added an unpleasant flavor to the margaritas I use this for . I was sent a replacement order and it is the same.What happened ?	-1
As you can see , I ordered a set of three boxes of these , happy for free shipping and a good price , which Amazon usually lacks on groceries ... and how disappointed I was , not in Amazon but in Numi ... I guess too many complained that the SMELL was n't like other EGs , and they 're right ... it was n't . Others spray alcohol-containing , leaf-wrecking oils on the leaves , leaving behind a horrible taste to me and also making the leaves oxidize rapidly , making the tea quality suck ! Numi HAD it absolutely perfect . I was ready to tell you how to get , out of their tea , the perfect GENUINE Earl Grey tea , one where the tea was n't killed by modern techniques of spraying chemicals ( essential oils are almost all alcohol , after all ; bergamot oil is almost always mixed with cheaper and easier to process citrus that grows far more places than a tiny town in Italy ) ... and now , I 'm just here to say `` move along , nothing here to see '' because in changing their fruit supplier or aging/malting process or -something- ( the tea leaves would n't likely vary so much , the brews side by side making the same color and the leaves being cut the same way and clearly the same region and process -- yes , I 'm one of THOSE tea drinkers , Steepster reviews and all ) , from the bags smelling like another brand , a rather costly one that starts with R and nearly rhymes with fishy , which has rather funky EG ( that brand sprays the leaves , which Numi proclaims my shared disdain for ) ... well , what was -- back when they had the boxes with the old man and his walking stick slumped in front of a cottage or whatnot -- the first and only EG I would drink happily , a tea I went to specific 24/7 restaurants at 2am when needing food just because I could at least count on the tea ... well , it 's a passing memory , one I have about half a dozen more memories to treasure before parting ways with Numi , probably with an email expressing sadness.I DO overall recommend their teas : The lemon myrtle chamomile , now deceptively called lemon chamomile when it 's the FLOWER not the fruit added to lovely organic chamomile , is hopefully still as wonderful , their Moroccan Mint is unsurpassed and the smoothest , sweetest mint imaginable , impossible to oversteep for that matter , able to handle a trio of steepings for that matter [ whereas Stash uses PNW mint that is medicinal , which is honestly only good to make yogurt sauce or ... medicine ! ] , and even for the ones like Golden Chai that are n't to MY liking , they 're still well made , just not a blend I care for ingredient-wise ... I simply ca n't recommend THIS Numi product anymore ( and I hope as I use the last of my others this proves the ONLY one that got `` revamped '' somehow , the `` how '' seemingly the fruit , whether they are doing it faster or using different fruit or outsourcing the bergamot processing or ... whatever they changed to make it a stinky-bagged , fruitless flavored , bitter chemical-aftertaste tea ) . I tasted the new just one night after a week of delighting in their original blend night after night , using my reliable method with precise timing and all , went away from it a full month , and in finding the last half box of the old , decided to compare them to be sure it was n't simply me being thrown off . It 's not . I do n't deem it so unworthy that it ca n't be a pleasant change for the people who benefit from our brunch outreaches geared at homeless populations , and it 'll probably be a welcome addition , but I will NOT be drinking the other 51 bags from this purchase myself , not when I have teas I genuinely love ( as I did this , which was barely drinkable with a LOT of sugar that rendered it barely-even-tea anymore -- before , it was best with a tiny bit of sugar and milk , but it was absolutely palatable with no additions ) .	-1
this tea is WEAKnot much flavor , neither bergamot nor assami am used to teas which pack a punchi use a small teapoti want one teabag to do the jobNOT the case with this teait is not THAT bad if one uses it for just one cupi do NOT hate it , i just do NOT like itwill finish off the rest [ had to buy three boxes , ugh ] , BUT i will not be buying again from this { brand ? }	-1
The tea is weak , without the slightest hint of bergamot scent or taste . Even if it were plain black tea , it is of inferior quality . They make a big deal of their organic , wholesome , green image . It 's all fancy marketing and packaging . I paid 8.99 for a box of 18 bags at a drugstore . I truly feel gypped .	-1
This is a joint review for multiple flavors . Amazon is idiotic enough to not allow separate reviews.EARL GREY : Note that the Earl Grey tea is not decaf . Other reviews which claim decaf are for other teas . Note the label on the top of the box of the product which says `` Higher Caffeine '' , false as it is . Somewhat unexpectedly , I drank two of these and then had to take a nap for two hours . This sleep inducing effect is most certainly due to the bergamot . As for caffeine , it seems to have a very negligible amount . In summary , this is a decent tasting tea , not the best , but not bad . If you 're like me and want a little caffeine , avoid this tea . ( 2/5 ) CHINESE BREAKFAST : I am not too fond of this flavor . The taste does not compare to other flavors such asNumi Organic Breakfast Blend Black TeaorNumi Organic Cardamom Pu'erh Tea . I wo n't be buying Chinese Breakfast tea again . ( 2/5 )	-1
The little packets soak up moisture from the air and cause the sugar to clump . It also makes the packets difficult to open . Pretty sorry product compared to Splenda and Equal .	-1
This item contains Stevia and Erythritol , which are not on the ingredient list ! ! ! Beware that this product is also not eligible for return .	-1
While I 'm usually trying to find ways to maintain tight control over diabetic issues and still enjoy a bit of `` The Sweet Life '' , I must say that the ad copy for this Agave item was actually sweeter than the product itself . Now what shall I do with the rest of this case ? Oh well , live and learn . Oh wait -- I just figured out a way to use up the rest of my case and be a hero in the same breath . I 'll give it to my sister , a few bottles at a time ! That way , she 'll have the pleasure of many small gifts of her favorite pure , organic sweetener and I 'll remain the generous elder sister that she already knows I am .	-1
The title says it all ! Not good for diabetics ! Stores need to take off shelf and stop promoting as diabetic freindly sweetner .	-1
I keep a drawer full of breakfast bars that I eat twice a day and have tried dozens of varieties . I 'd rank these as the second worst I 've ever had . There are other flavors of Zoe 's bars that I like better but this flavor tastes really fake ( and my grandson agrees ) . Furthermore , they flake when I try to eat them such that I ca n't eat them at my desk without getting my lap and everything on my desk covered with pieces of the bar.For better options , try Clif Zbars for kids ( just the right size for a snack ) and Erin Baker 's Breakfast Cookies ( huge and filling ) .	-1
Definitely by far not the best-tasting energy bar out there . As far as nutrition , since that information is readily available , there 's little point in putting it in a review.I 'd look elsewhere if you 're looking for one that tastes good .	-1
I just bought 4 boxes and apparently the sale going on is one where they are getting rid of defective bars ready to expire . Every bar in 4 boxes was defective . All were only partially covered with very thin chocolate ( I 've been through 12 boxes since Spring and this did not happen with the others ... ) , all were drying up , cracking and all expire within 3 weeks . I 've written to the company ... so far no response . Very disappointed.Edit : Company responded by telling me I needed to mail in bars for them to investigate . I bought these on a sale with free shipping and have n't the time nor want to spend the money to be mailing bars in to their company with no promise of reimbursed shipping , etc. , so I 'm letting it go and have since moved on to a more trustworthy brand .	-1
I bought these on impulse as they were on sale . Very disappointed in the flavor and texture . My mouth felt dryer and dryer the more i chewed and i could barely swallow it . These will go to the food bank where i hope someone will benefit from them . Will not purchase again .	-1
It 's not what I expected . I thought it would be a dried crunchy peapod . Except it 's more like a Cheeto without the cheese -- maybe even greasier . If I 'd read the product information a little more closely , I may have noticed , `` baked snack formed in pea-pod shape from dried peas and a little rice . `` They 're not so `` healthy '' either . Make sure you read the `` Nutrition Facts '' : [ ... ] I love Cheetos but I was looking for a snack with a little more dietary/nutritional value . These are n't it for me .	-1
Several of the bags were not sealed and had to be thrown away . Poor quality packaging . Wo n't buy again .	-1
There 's a slightly odd taste about this product that I ca n't figure out from the ingredients . These are not a substitute for veggies as some people reviewing seem to think . They 're basically a potato chip replacement and just as unhealthy but slightly lower in fat . These are definitely `` junk food '' and should be eaten with that in mind in terms of frequency and quantity . The fact that they 're called peas is only because they 're molded to look like peas . Read the label ! I wo n't order them again mainly because of the weird off-putting taste .	-1
I blame myself for not turning the bag over and reading the ingredients , but I thought these were something else . This item was in the produce section of Walmart and since I love sugar snap peas ... .well you get the drift . Let me tell you that these are not baked sugar snap peas ! They are greasy cheeto-like green things . The put me in mind of those fried potato sticks in the can as far as taste is concerned . These crisps should be in the potato chip aisle along with all the other greasy fattening chips , and not with the produce to make the consumer think she 's getting a nutritious baked snack .	-1
I bought these because I was looking for a crispy low calorie snack to replace potato chips in my diet . THIS IS N'T IT ! Although I like Caesar salad this does n't even remotely taste like anything in one . I wish I had n't bought an entire case of these . None of my friends like them either so I guess I 'll just throw them out .	-1
After i read the reviews ... i felt this was the right healthy snack.The product description saya & # 34 ; Baked & # 34 ; .but the crisps are very oily ... not worth your money	-1
I did n't care so much for these crackers . I know that they are supposed to be better for me , but I suppose I 'm a die hard Cheese It fan . I like the Kashi granola bars because they are definitely healthy and chick full of good ingredients , but these had a weird aftertaste and the texture was a lot like the reduced fat Cheese Its . I did n't like the flavor and they were pretty bland anyway . Sorry , Kashi .	-1
This cookie has no chocolate flavor . The texture is gritty and crumbly.I would not buy them again .	-1
I am wheat , gluten , and dairy-free and generally avoid packaged and processed foods , but there are a number of tasty , safe , gluten-free products out there . This is not one of them . I detest these cookies . The texture is awful . Dry . Like eating a cake made of sand . Save yourself and eat a piece of fruit instead .	-1
I was very disappointed with this cookie . The lemon was so strong and artificial tasting that I through most of them away .	-1
I , too , figured these must be terrific , based on the reviews . But one bite and I wanted to spit it out . These are the worst . Sandy , crumbly , taste like they 're spoiled . A big disappointment and waste of money .	-1
Although I love the Nana 's brownie mint , and peanut butter flavor cookies , I found the ginger cookie disappointing . It was too spicy to be enjoyable , and more crumbly than the other cookie flavors . ( The crumbliness is due to the gluten-free rice flour . ) Also , the ginger cookies are more fattening than the other flavors I 've had : 360 calories per cookie , compared to the peanut butter at 316 per serving and the chocolate mint at 300 calories.Note that Nana 's cookies lists the calorie count as 180 per serving , but they count a serving size as half a cookie .	-1
The only good thing I can say about the Lemon Gluten Free cookies is that they really do have a good lemon flavor ! The texture was like sand . In fact it was very much like a slab of wet sand with a good lemon flavor . Sorry to say , but I spent lots of money on this and am now stuck with what I consider inedible products .	-1
NOT WORTH THE MONEY , TASTE LIKE HAD PEPPERS IN IT , BROKE OUT MY MOUTH . COULDN'TGIVE THEM AWAY .	-1
The flavor is decent ( berry vanilla ) , but I just ca n't handle the texture . It 's like a mouthful of sawdust that just disintegrates when you bite into it . I 've been gluten free for about 6 years , and there are much better products out there . My kids wo n't even eat these !	-1
It 's Crunchy , I 'm now love the smoother Nana 's LikeNana 's No Gluten Lemon Cookie , 3.5-Ounce Cookies ( Pack of 12 ) orNana 's No Gluten Chocolate Cookie , 3.5-Ounces ( Pack of 12 ) you get the idea I hope ! ! I do n't have coffee or Chocolate anymore ! If you do n't have a problem GREAT but I found out I do ! !	-1
I was a bit disappointed in these . They crumble very easily and have an unusual texture . My son ( 6 ) does not like them .	-1
We have a gluten free household of 5 . No one in our family likes these . My children ( 9 , 7 , & 5 ) are begging me to throw the box away - I think they are afraid I 'll sneak one in their lunchbox . The cookie crumbles leaving a dry mess of rice flour and hardish chewy fruity bits in your mouth . Have a glass of water nearby if you try these . I hate to leave a bad review , but there are way better gluten free options out there . ( I wo n't throw the box away . I 'll pass it on to another gluten free family I know and let them form their own opinion . )	-1
After eating this product , I had a stomach ache followed by hours on the toilet . Those of you with a gluten intolerance and Celiac disease know exactly what those symptoms mean ... somehow this product is contaminated with gluten ! It is NOT gluten free ! Please spare yourself the pain and suffering . These cookies are not worth it.For those of you who are tempted to continue eating this product even after you have been informed that it is not gluten free , please keep these facts in mind:1 . If you eat gluten , it damages your intestinal lining.2 . If you keep on eating gluten the damage to your intestines will get worse and so will your symptoms.3 . If you further continue to eat gluten you will end up in malabsorption , increase your risk for intestinal cancer , and lead to all sorts of problems including infertility , autoimmune disorders , oteoporosis.In other words , cheating on your diet is not worth it ! Do n't eat Nana 's products ! Instead , I suggest you buy something like Pamela 's chunky chocolate cookies . They are one of my favorites .	-1
My daughter chews/bites almost everything . But this snack is pretty hard to bite . The size of the wagon wheel is so big that it just goes entirely in her mouth that she can hardly chew . The texture is like that of a hard pita chip . Unless your crawler has all the teeth , I am sure he/she would not be able to eat this.The taste is also not that great compared to puffs and maple cinnamon crunchies .	-1
these go stale faster than you can imagine . As soon as I open them I put them in a tupperware that is seal tight and it still goes stale . Not really worth the money , much better things to feed baby anyway	-1
Even my dog hates these chips . Although I appreciate organic foods , this was a loss . Why ca n't you make a normal cheddar version ?	-1
I have tried multi grain chips before , and these are the worst . Too thick , and not very tasty . And I bought a case . Dumb Me !	-1
Stale as all get out . Was like tying to eat wood chips . I was beyond disappointed . Went out & bought some jerky from Walmart - their store brand beats this . Would probably have been good when it was fresh .	-1
Since I really loved Buffalo Bill 's Extra Smokey Links , I thought I would enjoy trying this beef jerky.Big disappointment . Way too dry and tough . Very little smoked flavor . Average ho-hum jerky taste . Buy Buffalo Bill 's Extra Smokey Links instead !	-1
I really like ChooChoo R Snacks Jerky , their quality is exceptional as I have stated in a previous review for their `` Big Slabs '' and their `` Country Cut '' . But this Jerky which I got today with the soy sauce is really not my taste , it is absolutely salty , and the soy overpowers the meat flavor itself , and far as smoky flavor is concerned , there is none I can taste , the jerky is also unusually greasy , really coated in grease to be factual . I will personally only stick with ordering their `` Country Cut '' and their `` Big Slabs '' where you taste the good flavor of the meat , and the jerky is moist , but NOT greasy .	-1
saltiest . jerky . evar . i really ca n't tell if this is salty beef or beef-flavored salt . the flavor itself is good , but i can only eat a couple pieces at a time due to the saltiness.. i guess that will make it last a while , but that 's small consolation ...	-1
This product was not as expected . It is a fuzzy product and is mostly dried fat . I mean it looks like the stuff they would clean off the machines after a day of processing beef jerky . I did not identify much meat in this stuff . It is very salty as well .	-1
Way too sweet . NOT spicy at all . Is jerky dust . Would have kept if slightly larger pieces and had an actual spicy taste , Sent back .	-1
i like the spicy jerky very much but the amount in each cannister was poor and was not worth the money i paid	-1
This was my first time trying Sumac , I blackened tilapia with it and could only taste the fish . If people are raving about sumac being lemony then I think I 'll throw whatever dark powder I got away .	-1
I had great expectations when I ordered these rices cakes . Received my box today and tried a cake right away . I think my tongue is dead because I could not taste the buttery caramel flavoring that was supposed to be on these cakes . There was a coating but not enough flavor . This part breaks my heart to write . I held off ordering the rice cakes so they would not be shipped in the middle of winter and ordered them now so they would not be shipped during our rainy season . I did not want stale rice cakes . My strategy did not work . The one cake I tried was almost stale but still edible . I put it in a toaster oven to dry it out a bit and that helped though the coating got tough . Went ahead and ordered storage containers from Amazon . Will give an update on whether storing the cakes makes a difference .	-1
These rice cakes have very little flavor and are very crumbly . I have thrown away the equivelent to 2 from all of the crumbs . The flavor is barely there and tastes more like a rice cake than the flavor says . I will go back to the Quaker brand , they are worth the extra money .	-1
WILL PROBABLY NOT ORDER AGAIN DUE TO OVER SALTINESS OF THE PRODUCT . THE TASTE OF THE CRACKER ITSELF IS OK BUT I CA N'T DEAL WITH OVERPOWERING TASTE OF SALT . MAKE IT LOWER SODIUM PLEASE !	-1
I would not recommend anyone to purchase these cakes . They crumble really , really bad . I had to use them as cereal they were so bad . Will not purchase again .	-1
Super thin and also hard and fibrous . It was in large sheets that you could n't snack on . Did n't taste the teriyaki . Had a old beef taste . Threw it away . Maybe making it from one muscle is not the way to go ? Needed a sharp knife really ... Thought it was historically accurate to what the Indians had . Maybe that 's what `` Western Cut '' means ?	-1
This jerky is a wide and very thin strip of *something* ... I was expecting actual meat pieces ... this was more a processed and flattened with a steam roller product . BBJerky does have some *excellent* products but I did not care for this one .	-1
For context , I 've ordered a lot of different beef sticks lately in my search for a good tasting low carb snack.To be fair , I may have received a bad batch or something , so keep that in mind while you read this review.These arrived last week and they were horrible . I had read reviews that they were supposed to be similar to the slim jim beef snack sticks , but they did n't taste anywhere close to the same . It 's actually very rare that I eat something that gives me the sudden impulse to gag , but that 's what these do . To me , these somehow remind me of both the taste of stinky fish and dirty socks . Nothing at all close to what I was expecting these to taste like.Might be a bad batch , but I was n't about to order another 2.1-lb bag of them just to find out .	-1
I thought these would be a good substitute for Old Wisconsin Turkey meat sticks or Old Wisconsin Pepperoni sticks . I got mad at Old Wisconsin for their prices going up , BUT now that I paid 25 bucks for Buffalo Bills , I realize how WRONG I was . The texture and flavor is AWFUL and they are so salty ! I bought the original flavor and just ca n't eat them . When I read the ingredients , BEEF HEART is the second one after beef . Yuck . I could easily get past that if they were tasty . Because of how salty they are , I do n't even want to give them to my dogs . I read they have great customer service ... Did I just choose the wrong product ? I am mystified by all the positive reviews .	-1
Taste and texture were not to my liking . Very small . Mold forms on outside even after refrigerated.I would not recommend .	-1
The pepperoni sticks tasted the same as the original mild sticks . The package was labelled 'pepperoni ' but definitely did not taste like pepperoni . I 'm not sure if this was a simple isolated mix up but I wo n't be purchasing more of this brand .	-1
The taste was somewhat greasy . Hoped for a product better than `` Slim Jims '' but they are not . They responded to my criticisms and are sending me a sample of another product they feel I might like better .	-1
had kind of a chemically taste , like cleanser.. maybe the extruder had n't been rinsed well.. ? preservative ? probably would have been tasty otherwise ...	-1
thick skin has more substance than the mush inside ; called pepperoni but who knows why ; so maybe try cut up in soup as last chance , or just for the animals	-1
Not a whole lot of flavor here . They are OK , but not quite what I was looking for . They are n't what I would consider spicy . The dog likes them , so you know they are n't really hot . They did come quickly . I wish the bag was resealable , but you ca n't have everything , right ?	-1
Guess its just personal preference , but dont like them . Ended up giving them away and using them as dog treats .	-1
The & # 34 ; meat & # 34 ; has a creamy texture like biting into a stick of brie cheese . Principal ingredient is pur & eacute ; ed cow hearts . Each stick has 14 % of the USDA daily fat allowance . I would n't feed it to my dog .	-1
Jerky does n't always get inbetween my teeth but every bite of this does . The consistency is just right i the goldylocks zone . Too soft and it sinks into the teeth and breaks when you try to pull it out with finger or tongue and too solid to chew light enough to keep the pressure off.In addition to each one being a mandatory floss- they make only good dog treats ( though probably not healthy at all ) but flavor is uneventful for human .	-1
speedy delivery , excellent packaging . This product tasted like it was masked with lots of pepper . Not really a good taste for my pallet . The sticks were kind of dry , and proved to be no better than a slim Jim . Would not buy again	-1
I have been buying the Tillamook Country Smoker sticks , and love them , but they are a bit pricey . I found these , I love Wild Bill 's kerky and figured I would try these beef sticks ... What a mistake , while they did arrive quickly , once opened I was very disappointed with the quality of the product , the casing tasted like paper , and whatever was inside was kind of stringy and tasteless . On a positive note the our dog Kate likes them ... So she will have some high treats for awhile ...	-1
I like the ones sold at my store better the ones out of the vins . The packaged ones just are not the same to me . The flavor lacks , & the texture does too .	-1
Not a very good jerky . I prefer several other drier jerky products . They responded to my criticisms and are sending me a sample of another product from their store .	-1
I 'm sure plenty of folks would love this product but it 's not for me . It 's a little bland and a little too sugary for me . When I say a little , I do mean a little . It 's not extremely bland or really sugary but I like a stronger stick with more spice . Maybe they assumed I was a sissy for ordering the turkey sticks . I was hoping for a healthier version of the stuff I like .	-1
These beef sticks taste very odd , and I 'm not sure how to describe it . They 're super-oily , which is gross , and the jalapeno/cheese ones have a lot of spice , which is okay . They just taste strange and have a weird texture . Try Ostrim beef sticks instead , they are far superior !	-1
2tbsp +8oz hot water.2tbsp +5oz hot water2tbsp +6 water 1 milkresult = same = NASTY = tastes like chemicals , like powder ... i think like milk powder . you can even smell that thing in the box itself . minimal spice . watery . powder.i 've done real chai with indian chai mix from indian chai mix store with indian chai mix instructions provided in english . this pacific & # 34 ; chai & # 34 ; tastes nothing like that , and worse than others such as oregon and traderjoe 's .	-1
I really wanted to like this soup . It 's organic , it 's supposed to be good ... it 's Amy 's , who has a great reputation in the natural foods community ... but omigosh , this soup leaves SOOO much to be desired . It 's mildly sweet , very thin , and the coconut taste is almost nonexistent . Mine had little pieces of green beans , sweet potatoes , carrots ... I LOVE THAI food ... but this is nothing like Thai food . No heat , no spice , just sorta mediocre white coconut milk with some good-for-you veggies and some tiny pieces of rubbery tofu . I normally try to be as honest and forthright as possible , but I also try to be nice and find something good about every product . The only thing I can say good about this product is that it was available in my local supermarket and I bought one can to try it before I bought 12 from Amazon ! If you find you like it , it 's also much cheaper on Amazon ( many things are ! ) and you may want to order a case of it . For me , I 'm glad that I spent a bit more on the one can and tried it before I bought a ton of it here . It 's just ... well , I finished the bowl , but I sure was n't impressed at all . It 's just plain weird . : (	-1
This was just awful . Upon opening the can , it had a grainy looking texture to it . After heating up , it had oily pools on top . The liquid stock was bland until a sour aftertaste hit . The vegetables were so mushy and tasteless , I just spit them out . I found nothing redeeming about the soup . And I so wanted to like it.I love soup , and I put off trying Amy 's soups for a long time because of their price . But I finally tried the Chunky Tomato Bisque , and it was out of this world . So I had to try the other offerings . So far , every other Amy 's soup that I 've tried has been mediocre at best . But we go through a 2-3 cases of the Chunky Tomato Bisque each month .	-1
I have loved every Amys product that I have tried [ well over 30 items ] . This is the exception . The soup is a runny liquid with few vegetables . The flavor has much to be desired -- very oily with an over-powering lemon aftertaste . The flavor immediately made me think `` so this is what lemon pine sol tastes like . '' There have to be a better options . Do n't give up on Amys if this is your first experience -- close your eyes and pick one of the other Amys flavors because it will taste better than this . If it were thicker , with more vegetables and a bit more coconut over lemon , maybe it would be worthy of three stars . Maybe .	-1
I am a big fan of the Amy 's products and the soups that I have tried have been great . I wanted to try something new and I came across this one at the store several times before finally purchasing it . I liked the looks of the ingredients and it being a complete protien I was sure it would be a winner . YUCK ! ! ! Not only was it gummy but the flavor was just terrible . I cant even put my finger on what it was but it was very unpleasant . So I actually found a soup that was terrible , so sorry Amy but you need to change this recipe or put 100 bucks in each can for me to buy it again.Great soups that I have tried by Amy'sLentilLenitl vegetableCurried LentilBlack beanSouthwestern vegetable	-1
Though the texture is hearty and thick , this soup tastes way too sweet for me . Is it really necessary to add 14g of evaporated cane juice to a soup ?	-1
I bought this because it said vegan on the can . I enjoy Amy 's products although this particular one gave me an allergic reaction . I am allergic to dairy products and thought that this would be safe . Halfway through with my dinner I got that taste in my mouth that only comes from milk . I wish that this company were to separate the equipment that they use to make items that are considered `` Gluten Free '' , `` Vegan '' , etc . I noticed the reaction and then double checked the can to see that they do in fact state that the facility does process milk , wheat , soy , tree nuts and seeds . Perhaps someone at the company will read this review and consider changing their preparation procedures as I will no longer buy any other Amy 's product	-1
I bought this at costco for $ 10 b/c ( pack of 8 ) , its organic and I like to eat soup before bed.There are 2 kinds , beans and pasta soups . Both are not good , trust me . Taste like old soup sitting for a long time.Do n't buy	-1
Worst soup ever ! ! ! ! It has so much of sugar , remembering it makes me go sick in the tummy . I guess I will stick to buying what I generally buy at Safeway . This soup was awfully sweet and unpalatable .	-1
This soup is n't flavorful at all . It needs more salt , more vegetables..everything . It 's edible but not enjoyable . I much prefer the Amy 's Chunky Vegetable kind .	-1
Unfortunately , we were very disappointed in this soup . I heated some and tasted it and threw it away . I will be donating the rest of the cans . Will not order this again .	-1
I bought this chili at my local Krogers so this is n't an Amazon Verified Purchase - but still wanted to post my thoughts about it.I thought this chili would be pretty darn good giving it 's a well-trusted brand . Amy 's - I thought - did really good organic healthy stuff . How could I go wrong with their chili ? Well , unfortunately , I COULD go wrong with it - as I found out last night when I ate it . This is one WEIRD chili . I do n't care that it 's vegetarian and does n't have meat in it - it just tastes WEIRD . First of all I was shocked at just how sweet it was - like , sweet to the point of obliterating all other sensations . Secondly - the beans were VERY mushy and almost seemed a bit over-ripe or over-cooked . And lastly - the chili seems to have been spiked with insane amounts of garlic . Like - I ate it last night , and I 've eaten/drunk other stuff since then and brushed my teeth and used mouthwash twice or three times since then , and I can STILL taste it . Call me hard to please - but that 's not what I want out of a chili.This is an odd take on chili and I guess it may please folks who do n't like more traditional chilis like Wolf or Kelly 's or whatever ... ... but to me , this was pretty gross .	-1
If you want real cream of tomato soup that 's reminiscent of your childhood , get the Pacific brand . This one is shockingly light on cream and the consistency resembles more of a marinara sauce . I use it too cook with but it 's just too strong to use as a soup .	-1
Almost 700 mgs of sodium in 1 cup ! Shame on you Amy ! ... ... ... ... .what were you thinking ? .. & # 34 ; organic & # 34 ; implies HEALTHIER ! ... very misleading , would NEVER order anything so inferior ever again ! My bad , I ordered by mistake ...	-1
This is the worst split pea soup I have ever tasted . There are way too many onions ... I usually like a lot of onions in soup , but this was ridiculous . There were more onions than peas ! It tasted more like I was eating onion soup with `` split pea '' flavor . On top of that , the onions did not even taste fresh , they were bitter . Amy 's usually makes great products , but they desperately need to change this soup . I give it 2 stars only because it is healthy , and there might be a small chance of someone liking this if they like tons of onions.Walnut Acres ' Split Pea soup used to be perfect , but they changed their recipe recently after I reviewed it . It is still ok and still tastes better than Amy 's Split Pea.Walnut Acres Organic Soups , Split Pea , Fat Free , 15-Ounce Cans ( Pack of 12 )	-1
This is gross . It 's flavorless , with a weird texture of beans and gritty tofu ( I think ? ) . I 'm vegan , so trust me , I 'm very forgiving on taste -- especially for something like chili . I made it edible by pouring some BBQ sauce and spaghetti sauce in it , but I wo n't be buying this again .	-1
I purchased this chili on sale at a local upscale grocery store . I was drawn to many of its fine qualities , i.e. , no GMOs , no trans fat , no added MSG , meatless , and no preservatives.The most significant reasons why I purchased this brand was because it is vegan , organic , and it comes in a BPA free container.I wanted so much to like this chili . I have had other brands of vegan chilies , but this is the worst I have ever tasted.I give this brand a 5/5 for packaging , 5/5 for organic integrity , 5/5 for appearance , 5/5 for texture , and 0/5 for taste/flavor for a score of 80 % -- healthy brand but taste terrible.After reading all the other reviews , I can only ascertain that I must have gotten a bad can or something . One serious factor was that it had no chili flavor at all . It absolutely did not have any chili flavor whatsoever .	-1
I 'm not a vegetarian , so maybe I should n't even be ordering a `` No Chicken Noodle '' soup . But I 've been really pleased with a lot of Amy 's other soup products . The Hearty Rustic Italian , Tuscan Bean & Rice , and Minestrone , as examples . Quite tasty ! But this Low Fat/No Chicken Noodle Soup did not compare in any way , shape , or form -- and that 's putting it quite mildly . It tasted almost flavorless to me , and what little flavor it did have was unpleasant . I found the appearance of the broth and the texture of the faux-chicken chunks revolting , as well .	-1
I used to like this . I do n't know if my taste has changed or if the product changed , but I do n't care for it any more . I do think it did a fair job of replicating chicken soup .	-1
Because the Prime Pantry can of AMY 'S NO CHICKEN NOODLE SOUP was seriously dented , I really wondered whether this soup had gotten contaminated and was unsafe to eat . It was hard to believe that anyone would try to pass off this earthy-tasting stuff as resembling chicken soup . For me , the only resemblance is the surface film of oily-looking yellow droplets -- which strikes me as a tour de force in a vegetarian soup ! The noodles , onions , and tofu bits taste okay ; but the soup liquid tastes incredible , in a very bad way . I ca n't imagine what ingredients they used to give the soup its flavor , because I 've never tasted anything like it before . What I expected was a decent noodle soup , but this product is n't even that . I rate it at one star ( `` I hate it '' on the official Amazon scale ) .	-1
We 've tried it at least a dozen or more times over the last decade . But it just tastes off , I do n't know how to describe it . It 's almost like a weird yeast flavor or something . We 're done . No more of this stuff.We 're vegetarian , and we buy Amy 's stuff at every single grocery shopping trip . But this is just not good .	-1
i havent found any of the soups from amys good . too much strange seasonings trying to make it good from not having meat i guess . weird after taste and the smell is awful . i thought , who can mess up noodle soup ? uh , amys ? very disappointed .	-1
I agree with the other user that gave this a bad rating . I hated the flavor of this soup , which was disappointing since I love black beans and I love Amy 's products . It hardly tasted like black bean soup , it was so sweet and bitter at the same time ... tangy , but not in a good way . After I forced myself to finish most of it , I suffered from really bad heartburn afterwards . Some people may like the taste , but I definitely did NOT enjoy it . Like the other user said , the only reason this soup deserves 2 stars is because it is healthy.I tried McDougall 's Black Bean & Lime soup before and I thought it tasted pretty good ; definitely a good alternative to Amy 's black bean vegetable.Dr . McDougall 's Vegan Black Bean & Lime Soup , 3.4-Ounce Cups ( Pack of 12 )	-1
While the ingredients may be organic and healthy , the soup is bland and impossible to eat without having to basically re-make it . It has no flavor at all , except perhaps a nagging sweetness from the corn . If you are interested in a savory treat or something healthy AND delicious , then find something else , or be ready to whip out your pot and start over . I 'll never buy this again . The only reason it gets an extra star is because it 's good for you , but that is its Only redeeming quality .	-1
Unless the taste of this differs by can , I would recommend to skip this soup . It just tastes very odd , and very little like black beans . I wo n't be buying it again .	-1
Very disappointed . Way too much liquid - 3/4 can - and not enough vegetables . The vegetable and lentil is much thicker .	-1
I wo n't be buying this flavor again . It was really bland and kinda slimy . I put a bunch of salt in it to get it down because I do n't waste food .	-1
I do not eat Split Pea Soup -- - got it for my husband because it 's a flavor he enjoys . He did not like this one ... ..made me promise not to buy it again .	-1
I 'm eating the first can of this soup right now . It 's very mushy ( gel-like ) and I do n't care for the flavor . Basil does n't seem to go with split pea soup . I like some of AMY 's soups real well , but I 'll have to pass on this one .	-1
While I am sure it is very healthy the taste to me was very bland . The mouth feel was quite nice and if there was more flavor I could have enjoyed it . I have eleven more cans to use up and I will have to add a whole lot of flavor to this to be able to enjoy .	-1
I have been drinking oolong teas for over 40 years , not because of any claimed health benefits , but because I enjoy the flavor - at least most of the time . After seeing how highly this tea was rated I was really disappointed with how it turned out . It has a fairly strong bitter taste , and the flavor is n't pleasant at all . If you open one of the bags you will find the tea has a sawdust consistency , no recognizable leaves at all . If you want a really good oolong at a reasonable price , I recomend the Numi `` Iron Goddess of Mercy '' loose tea .	-1
I was so disappointed when I read the label on this product . The edamane is grown in California -- as I interpret the label -- but is a product of China . I would not have purchased this item had I known it was packaged , or whatever , in China . I do not buy food items from China . Too bad as the product tastes good .	-1
twice the price for about 15 percent less product than another soy multi-pack offering that 's 5-star rated on the same page ; hello ?	-1
So YUCKY ! I did not like these at all . They were so dry . I certainly would not order ever again .	-1
IN A NUTSHELL : 29 GRAMS OF SUGAR OUT OF 45 GRAMS OF PRODUCTSugar dominates the taste of these little dots and is the first ingredient . Add to that some red dye # 40 and yellow dye # 5 and I have lost my appetite . Our daughter Angela however was singing a different tune . She gobbled the whole bag down after I told her I had opened them but was finished . I informed her of the dyes , the sugar , the artificial flavors and more . After she wolfed the bag down she simply replied ; -- `` SO -- DO YOU HAVE ANY MORE ? '' -- BOTTOM LINE : WE ASKED FOR THESE PRODUCTS BECAUSE WE BUY THEMI do n't care for these 'fruit flavored snacks ' , but some people do , including people in our household . I do n't like the ingredients , but that does not trouble some of the people in our household either . Until these things are objectionable to more consumers , including Angela , Kellogg 's will be happy to continue churning them out and filling them with dyes , sugar and artifical flavors . [ I AM NOT AFFILIATED WITH ANY PRODUCT OR COMPANY ]	-1
Posting this as a warning , youll eat some and things will be normal and then youll get one thats so strong it will make you gag . I really love VERY hot but this is too much - not a good product at all .	-1
The amount of wasabi in these things made me choke and tear up . The wasabi dust gets into the nostrils and is quite irritating . Perhaps these would be edible if you could clean them off a bit first . Made in China .	-1
These were nasty , they were so greasy and too rich for my blood , plus they lacked major flavor , no spicy jalapeno flavor at all . I was so dissapointed in these chips , I am always hearing great things about these chips but I am telling you , yuck yuck yuck . Give me pain chips any day . Maybe there is a better kettle chip brand out there but I am staying clear from these chips . I wish I could give these zero stars if I could .	-1
After waiting a ridiculous amount of time for my case of 15 5oz bags to arrive , upon opening the box noticed that every bag had been chewed open by a mouse . Do n't know if it is still in the box , but it is outside on the porch . When my son gets home , I 'm going to have pictures taken and email to Amazon . The outside Amazon box was intact , so it had to be either from the Kettle Chips people or the Amazon warehouse , do n't know which . I will never buy these again from Amazon . I can not tell you how disgusted I am with this purchase . It makes me sick to think about it ! I included pictures at the top of the page . Poor little mousie must have high cholesterol now.Update : I forgot to mention that I offered to email the above pictures of the mouse damage to Amazon but was told they did n't want them .	-1
`` Yeast Extract '' is listed as an ingredient . Sounds harmless , right ? Specifically , these chips contain autolyzed yeast extract , which is , on a chemical level , monosodium glutamate . It 's just derived from a different source , but it has all the same toxic properties . Kettle still advertises their products as containing `` No MSG '' while they acknowledge that their chips are not safe for people with MSG sensitivities .	-1
I did not like these potatoe chips . It 's hot , and sweet , with an overwhelming taste of garlic . It 's also a bit salty .	-1
I was so excited thinking they had my favorite discontinued Kettle flavor , but was disappointed when I opened the box and found this substitution . I am keeping them but would not have ordered 15 bags of this flavor . It is a very good bbq chip but I could get this flavor at the grocery store . Why oh why do my favorite food items always get discontinued ? ? ? The one star is for the substitution . The country bbq is a 4 start chip , but not the chip I longed for .	-1
I love Kettle Chips and order them from Amazon and buy them in local stores . I was excited to try this flavor , because I really like Sriracha , too , and it sounded like a great combo . Well , something was lost in the execution - it tastes hot ( not too hot ) , has a hint of sweetness , but no flavor . It does n't taste like Sriracha or potato chips . These are just kind of blah and lifeless , with a slightly bitter aftertaste . I do n't recommend these .	-1
The fact that Kettle Foods claims their products are `` All Natural '' really , really , really upsets me . These chips , and many other Kettle chips , contain `` yeast extract . '' On a chemical level , yeast extract is the same thing as MSG ; it 's just derived from a different source . Kettle labels some of their products with `` NO MSG , '' but their reps say people who are sensitive to glutamates should avoid their products . Be an informed consumer .	-1
The taste of these chips is just ... WEIRD . There was something very off about the flavor . I could n't even stomach them !	-1
The red bag and the bold & # 34 ; SRIRACHA & # 34 ; label made my mind run wild with fantasies of a spicy , tangy , and garlicky chip with the crunch and density of Kettle Brand chips . Unfortunately , if you actually want something spicy , you should just skip right over these.They taste nothing like Sriracha sauce ; the flavor reminds me of BBQ flavored chips but lighter . You can feel the heat after eating several chips , but it 's still really mild , especially for people who are used to adding Sriracha to everything.I do n't recommend these for Sriracha lovers , but if you enjoy BBQ flavored chips and want something with a slight kick , then you might enjoy these .	-1
I opened a bag of these and poured them into a bowl . One of the chips on top had something black on it . It looked like black tar or melted black crayon . I assumed it was a contaminant of some sort , since it did n't resemble any kind of food ingredient . I wish I had not bought these chips . I am now wary of all Kettle products .	-1
I 've bought these at the local supermarket and enjoyed them although they are so salty that a few leave my tongue and roof of my mouth burning . Keeps you from eating too many ! Occasionally I get really stale items from Amazon.com and this was one . Unedible . Beware of the quality of food items on this website that are on special as they can be very close to due dates or in this case , not expired but stale and unedible just the same .	-1
I ended up throwing all of these bags out . They tasted like they were made from old , burned oil . Totally inedible.The shame is , I bought another flavor of the same brand , and had to throw them out as well . Live and learn .	-1
I love the gluten free , I love the no GMO , I like the all-natural . It 's been a while , but I 've liked chips by this brand.I got a 24 pack of 2 ounce chips , and I found the Sriracha chips inconsistent . Some bags had stronger flavor than others . And sadly the ones without much flavor made me realize that I really do n't like the the taste of the chips . When I got a really good chip it was almost a mix between salt and vinegar and a spicy chip . Even in the same bag the flavor seemed very inconsistent.But after having the flavorless ones that I did n't like , I 'm beginning to taste what I do n't like even when the flavoring is good.The chips themselves taste like either old oil or too much oil or overused oil or something . I read other reviews where people say they 're different and worse than the used to be and I hope that 's not true . They were months from the best by date so that was n't the issue.I think partially they just hit me at the wrong time . I expected spicy and the bag was n't so I was turned off . Then another time I expected bland and got pretty spicy . It 's hard to like something you ca n't pin down.Sometime I 'm going to have to try jalapeno -- my favorite -- to see if they taste how I remember . But for now , I 'm totally turned off from kettle chips !	-1
I hope that one day this snack can reach the point where it is truly healthy and consistently good.A ) Claiming to be healthy , at least - last bag I munched on had nutrition info that would in one serving give you the bare minimum healthy cholesterol score ( & lt ; 300 ) for an entire DAY . Many snacks do this . Like peanuts . Or popcorn . The idea is that since the products are from 'natural ' sources , there is less control over the batch . But seriously - less than 300mg per serving ? Give me a break . This gives no one trying to help themselves in this area any hope of control . It 's almost like writing a blank check . To yourself . To state that your product 's single serving falls less than the daily total max recommended is garbage . Read the label.B ) The batches may be uneven in cholesterol , and they may avoid legal issues by setting it at the 'max ' . But the uneven textures and flavors you may get ( I consumed , along with family and friends , several cases of these over 2 years or so ) do n't add up , either . I had burnt tones , teeth-cracking textures at times.I used to love these chips , much as the majority of the reviews portray . I thought I was enjoying at the least a fair product , staying healthy , keeping the fat away . But - they are simply simple carbs with a little twist of fat that get you by in the place of their higher-fat brethren . In case you are not sure of where I stand , I am one of those people who think carb-laden chips are not a great food . You do n't miss health until you lose it . These chips will not help your health . They might , at best , make it slightly less worse than everyday chips - at twice or more the price.A leading non-profit consumer org concluded this was 'junk health food ' . They cited other causes , as well . I wholeheartedly concur that this is not a healthy food . It is a junk food that is masquerading as one.ADDENDUM : Just got around to adding this . My wife purchased a bag of the `` Hickory Honey BBQ '' at the beginning of July . They were real dental-rattlers , uneven but thick-cut and baked into seriously hard material . The spices were horribly uneven.Lot mark : 12JUL12 090227921:37Update : My wife purchased a bag of these locally today , 12-4-12 . Green tasting off-flavors . These chips continue to be inconsistent . Maybe like the girl with a curl for you.Lot mark : 28FEB13 092504920.01Hits keep coming . Wife got a bag of the Aged White Cheddar , some chips had the same off-flavors . The bad tastes could n't even be covered up by the cheese/spices.Lot mark : 24JAN13 092143915:53Over $ 14/lb . What else can you buy for that price ?	-1
I bought a box of these baked barbeque Kettle brand chips from Amazon in somewhat larger-sized bags , because they came so highly recommended by other reviewers , but I really do n't care for them at all ( though other people to whom I 've offered them munch through them quite happily , and are pleased to take the rest of the bag home with them when I make the offer ) . I can only conclude that individual palates may respond very differently to these particular chips.So , if you 've bought a bag of Kettle 's baked chips in this particular flavor recently in your local grocery store and found them quite tasty , you 'll probably be quite happy with buying these by the box-full from Amazon.However , if you have n't yet tried them , do NOT invest in a multi-bag shipment until you first discover whether or not these particular chips appeal to your particular palate.I 'm busy giving away every bag I bought , because I developed a distaste for them after eating the first few chips from the first bag I opened ( which I ended up throwing away half-full ) . But my dislike for these baked barbecue-flavor chips from Kettle brand ( whose other , 'full-fat ' chips I 've almost always relished ) is definitely a minority opinion among my friends and neighbors , so far .	-1
I did n't like this @ all , I know what French Onion soup tasts like from a restaurant , I think Campbells tasts way better then this stuff.Well campbells changed their recipe and now I have to make my own : (	-1
Over the past 2 years I 've ordered 10 cases of these wonderful cheese crisps but my lastorder was NOT the same . Every box in the case tasted the same , NO flavor . I E-mailed thecustomer service department at John WM Macy 's and got no response . I took a chance andordered a second case and it was the same . I 'm very disappointed . When you find a productyou like so much you tend to count on the same taste , my guess is the cheese is n't the same.I do n't blame Amazon for this , it 's the Company that is n't living up to the standards it should.I was always willing to pay the price but now it 's not worth it . If I ever hear back I 'll fill you inbut so far after 3 E-mails to Macy 's NOTHING . Before I gave them 5 stars , not now .	-1
I accidentally bought these Nibblers as opposed to the Pieces I was used to and WOW these seem to have almost ZERO flavor . I mean , yes , there is flavor , but it 's so faint that it 's very boring to me and I 'd rather just eat plain pretzels . It 's like they 're teasing you with flavor and you 're never satisfied . I 'm really glad I just bought one bag at Big Lots .	-1
Snyder 's of Hanover makes good pretzels ( Honey Mustard & Onion is my favorite ) , but these are just not appetizing at all . `` Hot Buffalo Wing '' gets its kick from dried cayenne pepper sauce . So if you are a fan of peppers you might like this pretzel . They are nowhere near as good as Honey Mustard in my opinion , though they are n't as bad as just cheddar cheese . Hot Buffalo seems to be enhanced by eating them with other food , in my case , chocolate M & M 's . If you like a spicy zing , try these pretzels , they are not horrible . If you like sweetness just stick to Honey Mustard & Onion . Nutrition-wise , are not the best as they contain MSG and caramel color . Also , if you consumed an entire 10 oz . bag in one sitting , you would be consuming 1400 calories . I guess their good if you are trying to gain weight like I am trying to do . Otherwise stick to the healthier counterpart of the unflavored ones .	-1
As far as a pretzel goes , these have the great taste of snyders pretzels , but as far as `` cheddar cheese '' goes there is so little in the sandwich , cant even notice it . The picture on the front of the bag looks like there is a lot of cheese , but the actual pretzels have a minute amount of filling .	-1
received on 9/22/10 only to find all 12 bags with sell date of august 22 2010. will get refund but beware.even cartons have stamped 'GOODS MUST BE ROTATED ' which i know means put out the oldest first.well they rotated it to me ! I wonder if thats anything like getting the shaft ?	-1
I gave this product a one because zero was n't an option . This is like a can of generic tomato soup with some overcooked bits of fish scraps in it . The only lobster in the soup was some shell . It was salty , fishy , nasty and inedible . Not only that , but 11 of the 12 cans were dented . A complete waste of money . Beyond disappointing . It made me angry .	-1
This is one of the worse tasting soups I 've ever eaten . I hated it , and now I have a full case . It tastes bitter to me , and my husband would n't even try it . Only my cat was trying to reach it on the counter !	-1
It is ok soup , but I expected more , as I love lobster bisque and tried so many different kinds in different places . This one is very watery and I could not find any lobster there . I guess it is ok for the price , but I would NEVER buy this brand of the lobster bisque again .	-1
Pretzels have no taste . Salt is almost nonexistent . Would never order again . I now give them to my dog to chew instead of bones for his teeth and to remove tartar .	-1
The flavor was too strong in this product . Worse than that , I think it is not gluten-free . Might be the spices . I was sick after eating it . Not good for those seeking gluten-free risotto .	-1
Lundberg has a Gluten problem with their 'gluten free ' food products . WARNING : they are NOT gluten free ! ! My entire family got sick eating Lundberg rice and rice cakes -- -- and this product -- -I should have sued ! The reps at Lundberg act all shocked about anyone complaining about gluten reactions in their products -- -but trust me -- -there is plenty of evidence all over the web of people reacting to their products . They need to step up to the plate and come clean about where the gluten is coming from . GF is NO fad diet -- -- it is life or death for some of us .	-1
These rice cakes have too much salt : 65 mg per cake . I have purchased them several times but now I will stick to Quaker rice cakes which are much lighter and have 15 mg of salt per cake , which is 4 times less salt than these ones .	-1
Number one - not completely as advertised as & # 34 ; brown rice & # 34 ; . Number two - supposed to be cooked in 15-20 minutes - took OVER an hour ! ! And , lastly , does not even taste good ! I may throw the five bags left in the garbage and will never buy a Lundberg product again ! ~	-1
I 've tried numerous coffee candies and this is by far the worst I 've ever had . I should have known , seeing the main ingredient as Glucose syrup . Not only does it break up in your mouth , but the texture of the center goop is nauseating like a blob of snot . It breaks into sharp shards first , then you get the gross inner surprise ... bleh ! ! ! If you like high fructose type syrup , then this crap is for you .	-1
Having had MANY candies for coffee before , I tried these to see if it was a little stronger tasting . It was , but the texture is a bit odd , and the goop in the middle is just disgusting . Glucose Syrup as the main ingredient should have made me stay away . These wo n't be back on the shelf at my house again . You want better coffee candy without the corn syrup crap , try Kopiko .	-1
I roasted it but it still tastes weird , in a bad way . I would n't buy this again . The quality of the product is good , hence the 2 stars , otherwise , I would have given it 1 star because I just wasted my money on this product .	-1
This product to me is n't all that great ! It 's high in Saturated Fat and I really do n't see the what the hype is around this product ! For me it 's another fad that I bought into and wasted more money ... check out my YouTube review to see my reaction to this product . [ ... ]	-1
I ordered this brand ONLY because it stated that it was in a JAR . I got a white , opaque tub , disfigured , from what I suppose was due to multiple liquifying , then solidifying . I could have gotten it cheaper and faster but chose this for the supreme qualities of glass . The oil tastes okay , but I have doubts about what else might be in it . Even the photo appears to be glass . What a con !	-1
I bought the twin pack before , and the date was great . Long time before expiration ... ..but buying these single from this company was not goo good . They had a very short window for the expiration date ... .am using them up as quick as I can . Next time I will but the twin pack . Only a couple cents difference ... ..Fast shipping with Prime ... ..	-1
We have used this brand for months and this is the first time we have been disappointed . Seemed like refined coconut oil not Extra Virgin .	-1
The first batch ( order ) was excellent . In the second batch the prunes were excessively soft and `` gooey '' . I wo n't be reordering this item anymore.Actually I reordered the 3rd time hoping I will be luckier . Unfortunately the 3rd batch was again mushy . So that will definitely be my last order .	-1
There is definitely an off taste to these apricots . I suppose it 's from the sulphur as noted by another rater , but I have had much better .	-1
This shipment arrived in a timely fashion and was well packed . These apricots could 've been very good , as their texture , moisture level and ripeness was good . However , there was a strong , overwhelming taste and odor . My family usually gobbles up dried apricots , but they wo n't have anything to do with these . Very disappointed , and a waste of nice fruit .	-1
I was really looking forward to having this tea because of all the positive reviews . Boy was I disappointed . I did n't have anywhere near the experience others had . I found the tea to be flat and tasteless . And certainly not capable of giving me the caffeine lift I like in the morning .	-1
I love Bewleys , when I am in Dublin . I have had inconsistent experiences with Bewley 's teas in North America . Dublin Morning was a disappointment to me . It tastes like I imagine tea brewed with Liffey water might . Yucky . I am sticking to Dilmah , Ahmad , or Tetleys/PG Tips when I really need a kick . I gave some to my bro her who says he loves it . So maybe I have a picky tongue .	-1
I ca n't say this is a very good tea.It does n't have a strong green taste at all ... .. its very mild . So for some people who ca n't handle the green tea taste ... ..it would be good for them ... or people just starting to drink tea ... ..It does n't suppress appetite nor does it help with metabolism ... ..The tea is not green once you steep it . It 's like a light brownish	-1
This is a really nice dessert tea . It is reminds me of Celestial Seasonings ' `` Vanilla Hazelnut '' , but with a much stronger nut bouquet and flavor . It also has a very strong caramel type smell.Since I wanted a more authentic chai flavor , this particular tea does not `` pass muster '' . My first thought upon smelling this was `` does this have chicory in it ? '' It could also have the roasted carob found in the vanilla hazelnut tea mentioned above , but chicory is more likely . It should not be advertised as chai.Currently I brew two different chais together ( Tazo and India Tea 's Cardemom Chai ) together . After that I put the seeds of two cardamom pods , one star anise , a chunk of ginger and a little freshly ground pepper before adding milk and honey . I was hoping I could just one tea bag upon receipt of this order . I 'll keep this , but my search for the perfect Chai in one bag is still on ! This tea also seems very sweet . I do n't know if they added Stevia or something similar , but I did n't need to add as much sweetener as I add to my other Chai concoction .	-1
I love peach tea ( and anything peach flavored ) , but this has has a cinnamon flavor that is too strong . I wanted so badly to give it 5 stars , but I would n't be honest if I did . I do n't like the cinnamon flavor . To me , peach and cinnamon do n't belong together . Peach is summer and cinnamon is winter . This tea might be better in the winter as hot tea , but then again , not , because peach is too summery . Cinnamon would go better with apple flavor . As soon as I finish this box , I will not buy it again.The cinnamon is way too strong . It made me sick at my stomach , and the aftertaste is horrible .	-1
I generally enjoy Earl Grey and have been buying Trader Joes own brand . I find this rather insipid and tend to avoid drinking it - which is too bad since I bought several boxes . It 's rather weak and not as full flavored as other Earl Grey and Lady Grey teas I 've tasted . Twinings is a better product .	-1
My quest to find THE perfect green tea led me to 'Bigelow ' . A big name in the tea industry.I steeped a Japanese green tea ( Sencha ) in one clear glass mug and Bigelow 's in another glass mug.Rules : allow the boiling water to sit for 4 min . Then gently steep for 4 min . Place onto a large pure white table top.The difference was dramatic . The Bigelow 's green tea looked brown next to the Sencha tea.The taste was just as dramatic . Bitter initial flavor with a dull harsh after taste vs. A Smooth consistent green tea flavor.I repeated this 3 weeks later with a different batch of Bigelow 's . Same difference.So if it 's GREEN tea your looking for - Bigelow 's is not the one .	-1
There are only 2.19 ounces of tea in 40 tea bags . The flavor using one bag per cup is very weak . Even with 2 bags in a cup , it is not nearly as good as Paul Newman 's Organic Green Tea and is a lot more expensive ! I will stick with Paul Newman 's tea from now on .	-1
Sorry 2 stars , it tastes like the box to me . I 'm kind of sorry I subscribe to it , because the one that you want is called Yogi Organic Oreen Tea . Get that one here . Yogi is superbo and wonderfully fragrant for American pallets .	-1
I got this tea because Twinings Vanilla Black Tea was way too expensive . Comparatively , this tea is a step above swill . The same sweetness and flavor does n't even compare . The smell is exactly the same , which made it even more disappointing when I drank it . It 's really weak , much weaker than I had anticipated . Do n't get me wrong ; it is drinkable and I 'll finish it - waste not , want not - but I would never buy it again .	-1
I love most different kinds of tea but this one just is n't as good as the others . If you want a better taste , just make some black tea and put a little lemon juice in it . I 'm not a big fan of the individually wrapped teabags either just because they make that much more trash to put in landfills .	-1
Is it me , or did Constant Comment get really weak ? It 's not what it used to be . This was like counterfeit Constant Comment .	-1
My headline pretty much sums it all up . This Bigalow Green Tea is your basic run of the mill , cheap , low quality bagged Green Tea . It hardly even tastes like actual Green Tea , it 's been so refined . This stuff is definitely `` Bottom of the barrel '' . However , it 's cheap , and it 's better than drinking soda or something , so if this contributes to your lifestyle change , GREAT ! I recommend looking into a higher quality Green Tea though . Organic , and possibly a Matcha variety .	-1
We like the product but wonder why 4 tea-bags are in each packet instead of each bag wrapped individually ? It 's kind of a pain in the a* .	-1
If you really love the grassy , slightly bitter flavor of green tea , then you 'll enjoy this . If you 're looking for a tea that makes it easy and more enjoyable to get the health benefits of green tea but with a yummy blueberry flavor , this is not for you . The blueberry flavor is extremely subtle and easily overpowered by green tea flavor . The berry aroma is potent upon first opening the bag , but the flavor just does n't deliver . I 'm really disappointed .	-1
I never knew what real , good green tea tasted like until I bought loose leaf Gunpowder Green in bulk at a Middle Eastern market . Pre-bagged green tea is awful , tastes like dirty water , and does green tea no justice . This stuff is no exception . I like Bigelow for black teas and their flavored teas , but this is just bad green tea . The mint flavor just makes it worse . Please do yourself a favor and buy some bulk green tea -- I recommend Davidson 's Organic Gunpowder Green , which is $ 12 a pound ( a bargain ! ! ! ) . I buy it off Amazon , and it 's an even better deal than I can get at my local market .	-1
Large scale production for mass consumption results in a very low-grade tea quality , and a low price.Mass production results in a depletion of the natural nutrients.This enables low prices , while the benefits are very limited , or absent.The enormous varieties of low-grade teas are typically grown at lower altitudes where the plants are pruned to create the maximum yield , via larger leaves . The processing is rapid to lower cost , and to establish large scale distribution.Quality is compromised.Cultivation , processing , and packaging of green teas to preserve the rich antioxidant profiles created by nature , is an exquisite art form.An excellent rendition of this exquisite art form is realized in the high-quality , Matcha and Sencha tea offerings from Kyoto , Japan , by Maison Tea Ikkoku.Green teas , by Maison Tea Ikkoku reflect a celestial combination of excellent quality , flavor , and vibrant well-being.Enjoy .	-1
Although this is a wonderful tasting tea , Bigelow confirmed via email today that this product is grown in China . I think it is then packaged in the U.S .	-1
I am afraid this tea does not have flavor of Earl Grey . If you want to make a strong tea , the bitter taste will come out . The tea smells wonderful in a bag , but somewhat its aroma went away once it brewed .	-1
I used to love this tea in the 1960 's - 1970 's then in the 1990 's Chai came along and changed the world for American tea drinkers . Like coffee before Starbucks came along and taught Americans what coffee was supposed to taste like the same thing happened concerning tea thanks to both Amazon and Starbucks . Americans were given crap for coffee and tea then we ( also thanks to free trade/world trade ) were shown the difference between the floor sweepings we called tea and the quality stuff working class people world wide took for granted : Brooks Bond , PG Tips , Teatly , India Tea , ect . Not to forget Tazo Chai Tea . That 's the one that killed my love for Constant Comment . Once you have a cup of Tazo Chai you 'll never like Constant Comment again . Sorry ... just being honest . As another poster said : Very bland . It is .	-1
`` Green Tea with Pomegranate and Acai '' seems more like an attempt to cash in on a health fad instead of creating a balanced and delicious tea . Here you have three products that have recently been hailed as miracle foods all bundled into one cuppa together.Although the health benefits and drawbacks of both green tea andpomegranate juicehave been well-documented , theAcai berry'sclaims are more tenuous . Acai berries have fewer antioxidants than grapes or blueberries , and no credible evidence exists supporting the other miraculous claims . Even so , with this tea listing `` pomegranate and acai flavors '' as the final ingredient on the package , the amount of each fruit is so minimal as to be inconsequential . There is far more `` organic hibiscus '' and `` organic rose hips '' in this tea than either pomegranate or acai `` flavors . `` But the real bottom line on any tea is the `` Green Tea with Pomegranate and Acai '' just does n't taste very nice . It tastes like none of the listed ingredients , and comes off as more of an attempt at makingKool-Aid-flavored tea than anything else .	-1
A delicious tea that has lost it 's appeal : 4 tea-bags are crammed in one little foil envelope . They are stained by whatever aromatic oils the manifacturer used and look unattractive . If you are the only one in the family that likes this tea , you use one tea-bag per cup.The rest are left in a little bag to become stale and to loose it 's flavor.I got 6 boxes.40 tea-bags in each ... I will never again buy this from Amazon or from this merchant . I would rather buy it in the store.The price is the same .	-1
Bigelow changed its packaging and it appears to have changed its formula for making Constant Comment . This tea used to have a rich spice and orange flavor and made a fantastic beverage on a cold winter night . But the flavor tastes watered down in this latest delivery - you ca n't even smell the orange or the spices . I actually thought I had somehow ordered the wrong tea but the bag still has the same ingredients listed - just does n't seem like the ratio of flavoring to black tea is the same . Frankly , I was disappointed by the changed product and will not be ordering it again .	-1
This product was very good when I began buying it but lately it is terrible . There is no taste at all . That 's the reason I no longer purchase this item . Thank you .	-1
I just really do n't like how these fit or work . They are too big even for a 3 'n half inch base and it is cumbersome and awkward trying to fit it into the basket . And , I do n't understand having to fold the corners over ... this , to me , would seem to make the brewing take longer . I have never used them this way and just used scissors to cut them down to the size of a regular ( Bunn ) round percolator filter . This works just fine and I will not buy these again .	-1
The spices smelled heavenly when they arrived . However , the product was poorly packaged , and the seal was broken with the spices leaking out into the box . And , no , I was n't going to try a food that was that poorly packaged . Personally , I think sanitarily made and packaged food products are just as important as products that taste good .	-1
These taste kind of stale , and have a 'whoosh ' of vanilla cream from the center ... ... Good if you like that kind of thing !	-1
I think anyone who reads the ingredients on this stuff and continues to buy them is not paying attention . Try smoking , testing for voltage with your tongue , or jogging along a congested highway ; maybe some more partially hydrogenated oils - trans-fats , Aspartame ( diet pop ) or processed cake mixes . Those will do it just as fast if you are trying to self distruct . It 's all friends of the fda approved and tastes ok , so ... .yo ho ho , eat up me hearties ! Or , pay attention .	-1
I was very disappointed with this product . I ordered it because it was highly recommended on the Food Network and also on the Travel Channel . I did not think the cake had much rum taste ( sort of like it had been sprinkled very lightly with the Carbbean rum ) and it was much more dense than I thought it would be . I tried `` doctoring '' it up a bit with more liquor , whipped cream , etc without success . Although one could eat it , it was not the best and I wound up throwing half of it out . I would suggest saving your money and making your own Bacardi Rum cake . You will be much happier with the product .	-1
We purchased this rum cake upon our return from the Cayman Islands because we recalled the rich taste of the rum cakes from that region . This did n't come close . I gave it 2 stars because it is moist and tasty . However , if you are looking for distinctive flavors and , especially , the distinctive flavor of rum , look elsewhere .	-1
I think anyone who reads the ingredients on this stuff and continues to buy them is not paying attention . Try smoking , testing for voltage with your tongue , or jogging along a congested highway ( carbon monoxide & physical dangers ) ; maybe some more partially hydrogenated oils - trans-fats , Aspartame ( diet pop ) , processed cake mixes , or statin drugs . Those will do it just as fast if you are trying to self distruct . It 's all friends of the fda approved and tastes ok , so ... .yo ho ho , eat up me hearties !

What with the high price and nice packaging , I was expecting a lot more from this cake . I could easily bake a much better cake at half the cost and twice the quality . I do n't know what all the hype is all about.It is a sponge cake with rum in it .. big deal .	-1
I first ordered the Chipotle flavor . I did n't enjoy the flavor very much , but the texture was crispy and the amount of flavor was perfect . There was plenty of flavor there but it was n't overwhelming like some brands are . It was because of this that I decided to give Blair 's a second chance . I ordered the Habanero flavor next . I was extremely disappointed . Gone was the perfect amount of flavoring the chipotle chips had . Instead the chips had so much seasoning it was darn near falling off the chips . I 've had a few brands of habanero before , but this one tasted nothing like any of them . It has almost a sweet flavor to it . I personally did n't care for it at all . On top of it all , the chips are n't even very hot . I was very disappointed in how hot both chips were considering the brand is called Death Rain . If you can find them , try Poore Brothers Habanero chips . THOSE are some hot chips , with a fantastic flavor .	-1
