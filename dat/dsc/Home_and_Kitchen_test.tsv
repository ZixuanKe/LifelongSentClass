fits perfectly where I wanted it to go . pretty heavy & durable . might buy another one here soon . received very quickly .	1
I love these racks - I use them in my closet to store my flats on my shelves and it really maximized the space to allow more to fit . Sturdy and true to size .	1
Space is a hot commodity for anyone living in NYC . We have some great ikea furniture with big shelves and these baskets fit perfectly in them . We keeps our smaller items in the basket to avoid them from getting lost . Will be ordering more soon .	1
THIS BASKET PROVED TO BE STRONG AND DURABLE . IT CREATED THE SPACE THAT I NEEDED . CAN BE USED IN CLOSETS OR KITCHEN . GREAT IDEA ! !	1
I love this thing ! You can put it just about anywhere in your home to store extra little things .	1
I 'm really enjoying my new & # 34 ; Under Shelf Basket Wrap Rack , White by DecoBros & # 34 ; . I put them in my pantry and they work great there .	1
Great versatile storage . We will be buying more . It 's not flimsy like I thought it would be . It is great for filling in unused space .	1
This rack is so convenient ! Wish that I had ordered 2 more ! I have found this the perfect way to make use of wasted space .	1
This is the best thing you could ever have for extra space . My foil , sandwich bags and parchment paper fit nicely with room for more . So where ever I need to use them I can find them quickly . Buy this	1
how about those bups and glasses that you stack on each other . that is a mess . this item doubles the space for short items like short glasses and coffee cups . I love these and wish I had more cabinets to put them in .	1
Of course it did n't fit in my kitchen cupboards ... but , it does fit perfectly in my pantry . It makes it so much easier to find the wraps . I 'm thinking of ordering a couple of more - many uses !	1
Perfect rack for under shelf storage for wraps , baggies , etc . It 's sturdy and fit right where she wanted it . Good buy .	1
I love this basket , it is perfect for my needs , I bought three and could have used more . It is sturdy but not heavier than the ones you buy at the large warehouse store and not as flimsey .	1
This is great to have . I bought a blu-ray player at the same time I bought this basket . I 'm putting the wire basket under the shelf that the video player is on to hold dvds and other material related to the player . Convenient .	1
this rack frees up shelf space for me it glides in easily and even holds heavy plates however i am using it this time for all my ziplock bags . my cupboards are deep and tall i would need a stool to get to the bags but in the shelf i can just grab the box i want and it is not in back of the cupboard .	1
This is very handy in my broom closet for cleaning products that would otherwise be on a higher shelf I need a stool to reach . I 'm so very happy with it , would highly recommend it to anyone for many purposes .	1
This item works great . I am using it under a shelf in the kitchen to hold aluminum foil , Saran Wrap and the like . It 's sturdy enough for those items and has cleared up some space in the cabinet .	1
I have extra foods wrap and bags in it right now , but when I have used them up or moved them , I 'll be keeping my paper plates in it . It is a real space saver .	1
I am , for the most part , happy with this purchase . It stores my long rectangular boxes nicely . Sadly it 's just shy of the right length and depth for me . Nothing prefab is perfect though , so it does the job . It does n't move around and the shelf brackets do n't get in the way . Nice modest design and sturdy enough for function !	1
You know how when you put something on a shelf there is always that wasted space above the item ? Well this takes care of that . I built a table for my Accuquilt dies and cutter . Where the small dies sit there is all that wasted space above them . I did n't want to build more shelves above those small dies because then I am stuck with that configuration . This basket is perfect . I can put things in them and if I want to rearrange things to be more efficient I can do it in less than a minute . I need a few more and will be ordering them soon .	1
No real problem with the under-cabinet rack . Fits the shelf and is fitted to hold rolls of plastic wrap or aluminum foil very nicely	1
Love it . It is strong so it does n't bend back when it is loaded with seran wrap and foil . Has a modern and efficient look plus is a huge help in organizing your pantry or closet . Two of them are great for multiple shelves .	1
A good organizer for just about any room ! Arrived on time . Keep in mind that if the shelf is too thick it may not work for you .	1
Great for saving room in your pantry . This product can be used for storing bread , small paper bags , plastic wrap and foil among other things .	1
Works great under a shelf to hold light , small and deep items like foil and plastic wraps . Can fit about 4-6 rolls if you unbox them . The 'legs ' that hook up at the top are not level , not mine at least , so it wobbles when I reach for something . But it 's just a wire basket for the pantry , so I 'm not too concerned about it . I wish they made a deeper one for larger shelves , so we may put larger items inside .	1
Unfortunately , these do n't fit inside my kitchen cupboards , but used it on exposed shelves to store odds and ends that are always used .	1
The under shelf storage is wonderful for the various wrapping products . It is definitely a space saver and makes it easy to grab whichever item I need . One issue I found is that I wish it was deeper from front to back . Otherwise , it meets my needs and I would buy another if needed .	1
Bought this for my daughter 's dorm room and all I can say is ... the quality is great and you could find so many places to use these , esp . with all the different sizes , shapes , etc . It 's a clever way to utilize any space you have that needs shelving ... without having to install a shelf .	1
We use this at work to store papers for our sales staff under a floating shelf on the wall . They are taking things in and out of it all day long and it has seemed to hold up pretty well !	1
This shelf is an excellent idea . I love that it saves space by holding things like aluminum foil and wax paper . However , I do wish it was a bit longer , as it does not have enough room for parchment paper .	1
Helpful in adding some extra storage space . Measure first . Takes up more room than I expected . I am using it , but not for what Iintended to use if for , because it would not fit into my cabinet . It did fit into a deeper corner cabinet ,	1
There 's nothing glamorous about this product . It is simple and serves it 's purpose . I use mine to store foil , saran , baggies , etc . in my pantry . It 's a really nice organizer .	1
just what I needed for my wraps . Perfect	1
I attached this to my lower cabinet shelf and put my pot and pan lids in it . Now I have tons more space in my cabinet !	1
Nice rack to store foil and plastic wrap and such . it is well made and very easy to place and use .	1
I love my new fruit basket . It is sturdy enough to hold 3 navel oranges in the top basket ; 5 green apples in the middle basket ; and 3 yams , 2 yukon potatoes , and about 15 fingerlings in the third basket . I attached mine to the ceiling with an anchored screw and an additional purchased chain.The baskets are shown in the picture with a flat bottom - I did n't notice that until I got the baskets . Its kind of weird to fit round fruit into but works . I am considering a second basket for more vegetables .	1
Works exactly as described . Very well built , would order again and suggest to anyone needing some organization to their kitchen . Excellent customer service . Better than in any store I have visited , loved online purchase .	1
Use to organize bath toys . I would buy it again . Havent used it for fruit , but hangong on my shower with wet toys for 3 months , no rust and in awesome shape !	1
What this item is -- it 's vertical storage space for rooms such as small kitchens , although I suppose it could also be used in a bedroom for photos and CDs ( if anyone besides me uses them anymore ) or in a bathroom for various hair & skin products . Mine hangs in the kitchen over my bar . It has held potatoes , onions , tomatoes , sweet potatoes , bananas . At present , I have put colorful Fiesta bowls in the wire bowls of the basket , and it holds individual servings of cream for my husband 's coffee , paper napkins , and pecans.The wire which makes up this basket is much heavier than that which was in the cheap three tier baskets we used to get at discount stores . It is a heavy , shiny chrome , which looks good with the stainless steel appliances and handles in my kitchen.One other benefit I see to this basket -- as I get older , I like to have things in my kitchen out where I can see them ( my cooking utensils in holders , my many spices in several spice racks , my pots on a pot rack , etc. ) . I dislike having to hunt items , so this basket is just another step toward making the kitchen visually convenient for me .	1
My mother had her kitchen repainted and replaced the old hardware with chrome so she wanted a hanging basket that would & # 34 ; match & # 34 ; for fruit . This looks good and is sturdy . The only issue I had was that the top basket was too high to reach when hung , but I used three or four chrome S hooks to lengthen the chain at the top .	1
It hangs way too high up . I had to go out to the hardware store and buy a chain to connect the top of the basket to my ceiling hook , otherwise I would n't have been able to reach the top fruits . The chain I bought is nicer than the chain that comes with the basket . The chain that comes with the basket seems a little crappy , but so far it 's held up fine .	1
Works perfect , sturdy , hangs well ... .great product ... baskets are big enough but not so big that they take up a ton of room	1
This seams easy to adjust and has a good hook and good baskets that do n't let much stuff slip through .	1
I figured for the price of this it was going to be small . When I got it yesterday I was very surprised to see that is was bigger than I expected .	1
I BOUGHT 2 OF THESE WONDERFUL BASKETS FOR OUR MEXICAN FOOD TRUCK & THEY ARE FUNCTIONAL AS WELL AS DECORATIVE ! PLUS WE NEED ALL THE COUNTER SPACE WE CAN MUSTER~ THEY ARE SOOO APPRECIATED ! THEY ARE SO WELL MADE & BEAUTIFUL , I KNOW THEY WILL LAST US FOR YEARS . THANKS SO MUCH FOR OFFERING THEM ! WE COULD N'T BE MORE PLEASED !	1
I love this . It is nice and sturdy and looks really classy in my kitchen . My only complaint is I wish it hung a bit lower but I fixed that with some extra chain I got from HomeDepot and added it to the top of the chain .	1
Nice clean look . Well constructed . Not too large as with some baskets . Just the right size to hang my Citrus or fresh fruits .	1
I was a little reluctant to purchase this hanging basket after reading reviews about the chain being inferior and prone to breaking . However , the price was right and I decided to take my chances . I 'm happy to report that I have no issues with the chain at all . It 's not super heavy gauge or anything , but it 's sufficient to support the vegetables and fruits I put in it . The maker may have upgraded the chain since those negative reviews were written , or I happened to get lucky with two good baskets.I can say that I 'm very pleased with the baskets and have posted a few images of them in use.The chains do n't get the baskets as perfectly level as I would have liked . I fixed this by crimping a chain link a little shorter on one side with a pair of pliers . No big deal really.Overall I 'm pleased and would buy these again .	1
Currently i have 5 mid sized potatoes , 9 onions and 4 apples on this and its holding up it like nothing . Granted i drilled this into a stud in my roof , this is just awesome !	1
I bought two of these & stacked them , hanging one from the bottom of the other . works well , looks like it would be easy to move the baskets around on the chains to resize the available space . Definitely 5 stars .	1
This hanging basket was exactly what we needed to optimize the space in our tiny city kitchen . It came out of the box ready to hang and is sturdy enough to hold the 5 or so pounds of produce we need to store in it at any given time .	1
very light weight , hangs nicely , good for the $ . like I said , its a bit on the shinny silver side	1
bought as a gift for my fiance , we live in a dry county and have to drive a ways to get beer . he has always wanted to brew his own and this one seemed the closest to our favorite beer from the east coast ... yuengling	1
I actually bought this as a gift for a friend , but I was able to taste the beer after he finished brewing it.I found it to be a very good tasting beer , very similar to Guinness in its darkness and bitterness , however it did not have the coffee flavor that you get with Guinness . Instead it was a smoother and creamier taste , but just as thick.I am a fan of dark beer in general so I enjoyed it a lot and would recommend this to anyone else who enjoys a nice dark beer .	1
This is n't a lager unless you use a lager yeast and not the ale yeast provided . With that being said , I really like this refill . It 's a very refreshing malty flavor with a smooth finish . This is n't a recipe for the hop lover , but for someone who wants a smooth and refreshing ale . I usually do 10 days in the carboy , 14 days in the bottle , and 14 days in the basement ( a 55 degree environment ) , and off to a party it goes . Everyone I have given a bottle to has loved it . I have noticed that the color changes the longer it conditions . It starts a pale red , and slowly fades to a more golden color . They 're not making Patriot Lager any longer , and I will miss this stuff . I hope they restart making it !	1
I am going to get more of this style and flavor . I like the Mr. Beer/Coopers beers . They are easy to make and for a beginner like me that is important . I also think that being able to make a great tasting beer all by myself ... kinda ... is kind of cool too .	1
This porter really worked out well for me . The taste is just along my lines . The product turned out very good . I have made several Mr Beer brews and would differently suggest trying this one out soon .	1
This is not the first time I have ever used Mr. Beer St. Patrick 's Irish Stout Refill Brew Pack , and this is my favorite flavor.One extra ingredient I use is adding a jar of molasses to the wort . It does slow fermentation down a bit , so be sure to taste it after two weeks of brewing in the Mr. Beer Keg to see if it needs extra time . After bottling and letting it carbonate for two weeks , go ahead and set the bottles in the refrigerator and lager the bottles for another two weeks . You will be impressed with the taste .	1
I 've made this one before and it was good but just a bit more bitter than I wanted . So this time I ordered 3 refills and made them in my 7 gallon wine fermentor all at once added 1 cup brown sugar per batch , Starting SG was 1.040 so the finished stout should be around 5.7 % abv . I keep mugs in the freezer and when I want a beer I fill one with cold beer and relax .	1
It 'll make a good yet weak ale , so throw in a pound of DME and dry hop with whatever you like .	1
Disclaimer : I used 2 cans of Aztec in a 3 gallon carboy with 1 pack of the included yeast , fermented a little cool ( not measured ) for 4 weeks , and wracked onto dissolved light DME ( batch primed ) . Following the manufacturer 's instructions exactly will likely give different results.I 'm a beginner and since I started with 3 gallon carboys instead of the 'LBK ' kit , I have had to learn as I go to find out how to use these 2 gallon refills until I have enough confidence with more complex recipes . The answer seems to be to just use 2 cans . At that concentration I 'm getting a lot more flavor . It is certainly not `` Coors '' , nor does it taste anything like `` Corona '' . The price comes to about $ 12 per 12-pack equivalent so my target beer quality is 'Leinenkugel ' . This beer exceeded that goal.The Aztec beer as I have described my procedure , turned out tasting surprisingly similar to summer shandy , a radler , which must have been a result of the yeast because there was no lemon flavoring in this refill . There was also a slight clove aroma , which was nice . This was certainly an excellent beer to the extent that it was gone roughly 1 week after bottling , except for one growler I saved to share with my friend again . He agrees that it turned out to be a very good beer.I suggest that after bottling , you check for when the plastic Mr Beer bottles get firm . Give them about 2 more days and then cool and test one . When I did this , I tested one about 3 days after bottling and it was right at its prime by my tastes . There was enough of the flavor from the DME used for priming that it was like crust on a lemon meringue pie , and the yeast was still active , which made the foam just like the meringue topping . Certainly something that I 've never had from a store bought beer.Me and my buddy opened the last of it a few weeks later after tasting the beer I made from a recipe . It was still great after the yeast had stopped carbonating and settled out , and so much better than the beer I made from recipe that if I do n't get good at making the less expensive recipe beer , there may be a shortage of this Aztec as I make sure I 've got enough to keep this fresh on hand .	1
OPINIONThis refill has been the most popular homebrew I have made in the past year . The Aztec Mexico is light , very smooth , and perfect for warmer weather . It has a little sour taste that seems nutty or fruity ( depends on the critic ) .When I serve homebrews , my friends tend to be hesitant but humor me for a taste before switching back to a `` traditional '' beer . I offered these up at three different gatherings recently and , each time , ran into a problem : calls for 2nd and 3rd rounds . I did n't always have enough conditioned that was ready to serve ! I guess this is a good problem to experience but I hardly drank any of this batch on my own ! I had intended on doing a video review but , alas , I ran out of beer . Back to brewing for me ... PROCESSI keep everything short this time . I fermented for 10 days ( adding 1.5 cups of white sugar and some mesquite honey ) , bottled for 10 days ( adding 2tsp of sugar ) , and conditioned for 2 days before having the first taste . Usually I spend 12-14 days in both of the first two stages but the shorter time did not seem to matter . I bottled withamber 16oz EZ Cap glass beer bottles.BEER DESCRIPTION ( as usual , from the label ) Light gold color , clean refreshing taste with a crisp finish , this is a classic Mexican style beer best served ice cold .	1
Needed additional storage space in the master bath . Combined the wall with the matching floor cabinet and the set works beautifully . I am impressed with the quality of the product . Great value . The dimensions of the wall cabinet are 21 '' Wide x 24 '' Tall x 8 '' Deep . The dimensions of the matching floor cabinet are 26 '' Wide x 35 '' Tall x 12 '' Deep .	1
This cabinet is well made . The wood is high quality . It was fairly easyto put together . The instructions were clear .	1
I love my cabinet . Came very well packaged and protected . Pleasantly surprised . Prettier in person . Was n't hard to assemble and is perfectly suited for what it was purchased for .	1
I bought this to replace a broken ClosetMaid cupboard . I wanted something better quality this time that looked better and could withstand some moisture from cleaning cloths without the particle board swelling and the surface generally disintegrating . I had a specific , limited , space it had to fit into and this is the only cabinet I found that fit , and was better quality.The stability is good/OK , about the same as the cheaper ClosetMaid , but it looks sooooo much better ! Assembly was a breeze .	1
I am a woman and I assembled this cabinet on my own . It was easy , parts were well marked right down to the last hinge and bolt . I love the material ( wood ) surface not like some of those cheap particle board kits . It has a lot of room for storage . Very cute and elegant design . Love the pegged legs . I did not originally purchase from Amazon , but I thought I would add my review for Amazon shoppers . I would recommend this to anyone who is looking for a good quality cabinet that will stand up and hold all your wares and needs without looking cheaply made . I love it so much I purchased 2 more . Buy this with confidence you will love it .	1
For the price you can not beat it , It is sturdy , and the only thing I found wrong was one of the front panels was loose but I just thumped it and went right back in , Do not use a drill as will put to much pressure . Great buy	1
Never juiced before , so this is my first machine . But I ca n't imagine there 's much more I 'd need . We have a two-year old that loves to watch/ '' help '' make things disappear into the shoot . And drinks almost everything we 've made ( except the one I could n't handle either ) . FYI radishes will overpower your drink pretty quick . I 've only stalled the machine once on a whole lemon , but my usual drinks consist of 6 whole carrots , whole cucumber , 3 whole apples , and 2 very large handfuls of kale and spinach . I never run into issues . The speed adjuster worries me , because its more moving parts and to be honest I 'm normally at high or low anyway.PROS : - Easy to clean up- Powerful- Well built.CONS : - Tall- Cord ca n't find a natural place to sit . Always fight it so the machine lays flat . Wish it 'd come out the side not the bottom .	1
I have owned about . 5 juicers , my current ones are a sharper image 700 watt and a Jack lalane , I juice 2 times a year for about 60 days at a time , no food just green juice.This is a very well made juicer , the best Part is that the cutting blade uses a magnet to attach itself so when cleaning it it 's very easy to remove and clean.Cleanup takes me less than five minutes , The included jug is great to keep the foam off the top of your juice.I very highly recommend this juicer and for the price you ca n't go wrong	1
Beautiful juicer ! Really looks awesome . Very easy to clean . I have never had any other type of juicer but it seemed to not make very much juice for everything I put in it . But maybe that is normal .	1
We have now used this juicer for one whole year and put it to work and it is still going.I ca n't even tell this was a re-manufactured item . It looked brand new and I would n't have guessed otherwise . Saved $ 70I must have compared and read up on 50 different juicers and am very happy I chose this one . It can juice nearly anything with 5 different speeds . The harder the food , the higher the setting ( it even puts digitally on the screen some sample foods to put in at that speed ) . We stick with level 5 for carrots , apples , cucumbers etc , I usually save an apple for last because it sort of helps clean up any leafy or citrus leftover inside.SOUND-I am pleased with the sound volume of this device . It certainly can be loud if you are standing right next to it but its quieter than a blender or mixer and its a smoother type of noise ( quieter than I expected ) . We have used it in the early morning and it never wakes anyone in the house . Also at different speed levels the noise is much quieter . You really wo n't need to run this machine for more than 30-60 seconds its so fast . Just make sure to have all your foods washed , cut , or otherwise prepped to just throw them in . Very few items will have to be cut , tops of carrots etc.- The SHOOT on the top is huge , we throw apples in without cutting them ( unless its a very big apple ) . The top of the shoot is smaller than the tube that way if u have to pound an item through the top ( to lazy to cut the huge apple ) you know it wont get stuck because the rest of the shoot is slightly wider.- It comes with a large PITCHER that we always use to catch the juice and then pour it into glasses from there . However there is an additional Spout you can attach if you prefer to juice directly into your own drinking glass.- When I pour it from the pitcher into a glass I prefer to pour through a strainer for any extra pulp but that 's just being picky . You certainly do n't need to do that step.- The pulp that spins out goes into a separate bin nicely . If you put a grocery bag in it you can catch all the pulp and just tie it off and trash it without cleaning the bin . We dump the extra pulp right into our compost.-PLUG - the plug has the coolest minor addition . There is a ring attached to the plug right where it goes into the outlet . This allows you to put a finger in the hole for when you pull it out of the outlet and makes it even easier to pull it out of the wall . Also the cord has a decent length to it which I found handy.- We throw in either a piece of Ginger or half a lemon ( with rind/skin on ) in with almost all our juices and the Breville handles it all . The most common juice is a quick 2 carrots , 2 apples and some ginger ( 1/4-1/2 inch depending your taste ) . We 've also made many beet juice drinks , I prefer to add apple/ginger to the beets as well.-It also makes great green juices . Example : 4 leaves Kale , 1 cucumber , 3 celery , 2 apples , 1/2 lemon and piece of ginger . I try to save the cucumber or group up the celery to put on top of the leaves to push them through better.There is no need to force anything , sometimes at most with a whole apple you just need to tap it with the `` pusher '' to get the apple started . But overall it is super easy and no fuss . If anything the clean up is the most annoying part but it all comes apart easy and everything rinses off if you do it right away . It also comes with a BRUSH that you can use to scrub the blades and the screen . It works wonderfully.One year in and its as good as ever ! Love it .	1
We recently decided to buy a Juicer . After doing some research , I knew I wanted a Breville and I knew I wanted variable speed.Slower speeds work better for softer fruits/vegetables and the faster speeds work best for harder stuff like Carrots.I decided on the 510XL and thought I would take a chance on this Certified Remanufactured unit to save some money . Not really sure what part of mine is remanufactured , but it looks brand new and operates perfectly.Only downside is that it only comes with a 3-month warranty , but for the cost savings , I 'll take a chance.One other tip . To minimize clean-up , we line the Pulp bucket with the little produce bags you get at the grocery store when you buy fruits/vegetables . I asked the store manager if I could buy a roll of them , he sold me a whole roll of produce bags for 6-bucks . I think there 's about a zillion bags on a roll , this is a much cheaper option than buying little kitchen bag liners.So far , very happy with this juicer and the 70 bucks I saved by buying a remanufactured unit .	1
My refurb unit came just like new - I could n't tell one bit of difference . Here is the review I wrote on the main page for this unit ( new model , not refurb page ) . I wanted to review it both places to help as many people as possible . I know it is a big decision on which model to get - at least it was for me : With over 600 reviews , you probably do n't need just another one to tell you this machine is a powerhouse so I 'll try to stick to the particular features which impressed me . First , I started juicing regularly over a year ago . I had purchased a Jack LaLanne ProJuicer at Big Lots for about eighty dollars . So , I started using it . While it lasted over a year , it was only around 300 watts . I found cleanup was laborious for the one cup of juice I would get . Also , the juice spout was lower so I had to use a small cup . If I wanted to make a lot of juice ( to make it worth the cleanup ) , I had to dump the small cup into a pitcher and repeat ( many times ) . When I did make a big batch , the overheat motor feature would kick in and I would have to stop to wait for it to cool . It did last me for quite a while but was less than ideal for someone who juices regularly . I really researched and came to Breville . When I looked at the highest end model , it did n't seem to have much more wattage or positive reviews for the money . I definitely wanted high wattage . I got this one in a refurb model so I saved about seventy dollars . That made the deal for me - 900 watts of power PLUS a small increase over the base model . I could not be happier.Here are the key features for me:1 . I love the spout . It is higher up so you can fit most cups under it - not just the dinky ones . There is a spout to use with the pitcher ( more on that later ) and an attachment for regular cups . Much less mess because of this little feature.2 . I love the pitcher . The pitcher is made to hook on to the spout so there is virtually no mess ! Plus , I can measure how much juice I have made since the measurement marks are on the side of the pitcher . The pitcher also has a foam reducer so , when you pour your juice , the foam does n't come out ( as opposed to just using a cup which has all the foam on top when you drink ) .3 . Clear spinner and top : I can see how much pulp is building up so I do n't have to guess when to change it . I ordered those small compost bags so everything goes right in there and cleanup is a cinch.4 . Brush : The brush that comes with it can be used for a number of things . Most notably , it is great at cleaning the blade.5 . Spinning blade : No more special tools - this thing is held on by a magnet and comes on and off for cleaning but stays tight for spinning.6 . Multiple speeds : I make mean green juice and get so much more out of my kale and apples . I can switch speeds to accommodate both . It makes a difference.7 . Large shoot : My husband bought me small green apples . I can pitch the entire apple in the shoot . It is marvelous . I do n't have to worry about even cutting it.8 . POWER : Of course , at 3 times the power of my LaLanne , it is a powerhouse ! I feel like I am playing fruit ninja when the produce splats the side and the juice comes pouring out . It is fast and powerful.So , those are my favorite features . If I had known this machine was out there , I would have changed over a year ago . And , for me , the refurb was good as new at a greatly reduced price . That made a difference for my budget.I have autoimmune flares every now and then and juicing minimizes them . I feel much healthier and have a longer time between flareups . So , for me , the money was well spent . I can make up a pitcher the night before , put it in the fridge , and have my juice waiting first thing in the morning . ALOT less cleanup than having to clean a machine for each glass of juice . LOVE IT ! ! ! ! Here 's the compost bags : Norpro Degradable Compost Bags , 50 Pieces	1
I have a memory foam bamboo type mattress that was too firm by itself . I needed some kind of topper but I did n't want to spend a bunch of money on one.After reading the reviews on this pad , I thought , what the heck , I 'll give it a shot.It got here exactly on the date it was supposed to and in great condition . Easy package to open , nothing complicated or compressed.PROS : * no smell* soft , cushy enough to feel right* fit my queen size bed perfectly* stays cool* Made in the USA ! ! That alone is a reason to buy ! ! & lt ; & lt ; & lt ; CONS : * noneI 'd recommend this pad if you need a little extra cushion . It gives enough , without being overkill . It 's not too plushy , not too thin , it 's just right .	1
I have a new plush mattress that is pretty comfortable on its own . When I added the Extra Plush Bamboo Fitted Mattress Topper , it made my plush mattress even more comfortable . I also tried this topper on a firm mattress . Although it improved the feel of the firm mattress , it fell short of actually making it comfortable for me . The mattress topper is somewhat larger than my queen bed , which is surprising but quite nice , since most bedding products are too small . The elasticized fitted sides would easily accommodate an 18 & # 34 ; ( or deeper ) mattress . In fact , I recently fell and wanted even more softness while I recovered , so I added a 1.5 & # 34 ; memory foam topper under the Extra Plush Bamboo Fitted Mattress Topper . The topper 's deep elasticized sides still easily covered everything . The topper is extremely well constructed and I anticipate that I will be able to enjoy it for years to come . The bamboo material is soft and silky smooth and has no odor . I have not experienced any heat issues caused by the topper . My impression is that this is a high-quality topper and well worth the price tag . It arrived very well packaged and enclosed a thank you note that was hand signed by Kyle , a business development associate , which I thought was a nice touch . I 'd definitely recommend this product if you want to add a nice squishy softness to your mattress .	1
We bought the bamboo sheets so it only goes we would get the mattress pad ... outstanding ... not too warm like other pads , stays in place ( my bed is elevated 6 inches at the head board due to acid reflux ) . Highly recommended ( 2 months use ) .	1
I love this mattress pad . I have a dog that will occasionally do disgusting things ( he 's really old ) and the last accident washed out of this with no issues . I was worried it would be too big for my washer and dryer , and it almost is , but not quite . It washed and dried with no problems and is back ready for the next encounter with the ancient dog . It is also very comfortable , which is a nice plus .	1
My wife and I are very satisfied with this topper , which we 're using to give an extra layer of softness to our basic Sleep Number C2 mattress . Compared to memory foam toppers and beds we 've owned in the past , the plentiful polyester fill in the Downlite Extra Plush Bamboo Top Mattress Pad is not quite as luxuriously soft , but much more consistently supportive , noticeably cooler , and has no lasting scent.WHY *NOT* MEMORY FOAMAlthough everyone seems to rave about memory foam , we 've been profoundly disappointed by two separate , high-end memory foam beds and one 4 '' thick high-quality memory foam topper -- all of which we 've owned in the last 7 years . After a lot of money , frustration , and back pain , here is the truth we finally realized about memory foam ... Although it does feel wonderful for the first one to three years you sleep on it , it DOES develop a memory and eventually stops offering you proper support while you sleep ! After extended use -- always a little over 2 years in our case -- memory foam starts to compress and crater deeper and deeper where you sleep , and takes increasingly longer to `` reset . '' After more than a year or two of satisfied sleeping , we would begin to notice the foam developing semi-permanent depressions under our bodies . These depressions gradually became ruts you could literally roll into if you tried to shift your body position to either side of the depression . Then a few weeks after that phenomenon began , we would start waking with increasingly severe back pain ( especially me ) . For relief , I would have to sleep on the couch for at least TWO WEEKS until the foam would recover and allow the ruts to disappear . Then I could sleep great on the bed for a few more nights again , but the depressions would reappear much more quickly -- in the course of only about 3 or 4 weeks . So it was back to the couch for two weeks , back to the bed for three , two on the couch , three on the bed -- -you get the idea . We 've had that exact same experience with two different brands of very high quality ( $ 1000 ballpark ) memory foam mattresses and one high quality ( $ 400 ) topper . For the record , we 're not particularly `` large '' people . I 'm 185 lbs . and my wife is about 120 . The problem IS the memory foam . Never again ! WHY WE LIKE THE DOWNLITE EXTRA PLUSH BAMBOO TOPPERUnlike memory foam , the polyester fill in the Downlite Extra Plush Bamboo Topper compresses but does not develop a `` memory '' to sag . For one thing , it is n't thick enough to sag . I would estimate it as approximately 1.5 to 2 '' thick , though the quilted construction makes it difficult to measure . When you lay on it , the loft compresses but does not collapse -- meaning that it gives you softness and support , but runs none of the back-pain-inducing risks that we 've experienced with thick memory foam mattresses and toppers.Unlike memory foam , the Downlite topper is not nearly as hot at night . We still might get sweaty during our sweltering Georgia summers , but we do n't have to constantly kick off the covers to get relief from the suffocating feeling we usually got from memory foam sealing off all airflow to our backs . Since I 've been sleeping on memory foam for so long , I ca n't say how the Downlite topper compares with other kinds of pads and mattresses , but it is definitely cooler and more breathable than memory foam.There is also no scent . When it first arrived and I removed it from the packaging , there was a mild ( but not obnoxious ) odor , but it faded before we slept on it that night . By contrast , memory foam ALWAYS has a distinctive smell . It can be quite strong initially , but even if it fades , it never goes away . I do n't know how to describe it except as a kind of minty-sweet-plastic smell . We got used to it and stopped noticing it except when laying on our sides with our noses close to the memory foam , but we 're grateful that the Downlite topper does NOT have a scent to put up with.WHICH MATTRESS WE 'RE USINGYour satisfaction with this topper may vary based on the firmness of your mattress . We bought it to add surface softness to our Sleep Number C2 mattress . The ( air ) mattress is adjustable for firmness , but we wanted to make sure we could n't feel the air bladders and also wanted to make the bed top feel a bit more `` cozy '' or `` snuggly . '' So far , this is a marked improvement as a topper for our bed . We do miss that undeniably more luxurious-feeling softness of brand new , high quality memory foam , but I will not fall for that trap again.If I ever buy another memory foam topper , it wo n't be any thicker than 1.5 '' because memory foam just does n't have the long-term support anyone who suffers from even mild back pain truly needs . No one ever seems to tell you that , so I hope you can learn from our expensive mistakes . I 'm convinced the reason you see so many rave reviews of memory foam is because people review it during the initial , impressive phase of its life -- before sleeping on it for several years to discover its defects.See my review of the C2 Sleep Number mattress if you want more information on the Sleep Number beds . If you have one of those ( basic ) mattresses , this is a nice upgrade to the surface softness.CONCLUSIONOverall , I recommend this topper . It 's nicely padded , nicely supportive , nicely constructed , and almost entirely scent-free . I 'll report back to update this review later , after we 've slept on it for a substantial period of time . [ UPDATE 9/10/2013 : After two full months sleeping on this topper and our C2 Sleep Number bed , I am THRILLED with the improvements in my neck and back pain -- which have essentially disappeared . Each time I lie down on the bed , I 'm still aware that the initial `` cushy '' softness of the memory foam is missing , but after lying down for a few seconds , that observation immediately gives way to a pleasant impression of how firm and supportive the bed feels against my back . After two months , that same initial impression continues to replay in my mind when I go to bed each night.More importantly , I can now attest with full confidence that this topper and bed combination alleviates ALL of the neck and back pain issues I was experiencing with the memory foam mattresses and toppers we have previously slept on . In two months , I have n't had ANY serious problems with pain -- and that 's a remarkable change from the almost daily pain I was experiencing before.More impressively , a week ago , I strained my back badly when I slipped while raising a sailboat mast and strained to catch the mast before it slammed down onto the concrete . The last time that ( same incident ) happened , I could n't move out of my bed for two full days and I suffered excruciating lower back pain for three weeks before I recovered full mobility . This time , although the pain and strain felt nearly as bad as last time , I was able to get on my feet the next morning and now , a week later , although my back is still tender , I 'm recovering exponentially faster than before with near-full mobility and can again lift modest amounts of weight ( like my one-year-old daughter ) comfortably . The only possible explanation is that this bed is so supportive , it is accelerating my recovery . I now realize now that the last time I injured my back , the memory foam topper we had at that time was probably exacerbating the strain at night , stretching out my pain and debilitation unnecessarily.Suffice it to say that I am well pleased with this topper and our C2 Sleep Number mattress . My wife -- who is now pregnant -- has remarked a few times that she misses the cushy softness of the memory foam a lot , but even she ( with her much better back ) agrees that this bed 's supportiveness is still much better and gives her better `` through-the-night '' sleep comfort . She just likes her bed to be very soft feeling , and this topper just is n't as initially soft as a more foam-like material would be . ]	1
I never had a mattress pad that makes such a huge difference ! I always purchased them as protection for my mattress . I purchased this one because it was bamboo and because the price was reasonable . This pad also serves as a topper in that it also provides padding and makes our sleep number mattress feel luxuriously soft and cloud like . This product is so amazing that I will purchase more products from this vendor because I was impressed not only by the product but by the vendor .	1
I bought this to add some comfort and plush to my new Sears & # 34 ; Cool Gel & # 34 ; mattress ( which is supportive but a little on the firm side ) . The mattress pad fit perfectly ( full size pad on a full size mattress ) . It did n't have any strong chemical scent that some folks are complaing about . Right out of the package , I got the impression that this is a high quality product and the manufacturers took a lot of effort into it . I 'd highly recommend this.I also bought a foam mattress pad from Kohl 's for a twin sized bed . Comparing this bamboo pad to the foam pad , I prefer this bamboo one , because it will not wear as fast as the foam and it is just as comfortable and flush .	1
Bought this to replace a terrible , scratchy bed cover in a rental apartment . It is 100x more comfortable than the previous cover . Very soft and easy to sleep on . A lifesaver if a new mattress is not in the cards .	1
I am so glad that others took the time to write detailed review of this wonderful topper ! My husband and I had just exchanged a too soft mattress for a very firm one , and in our haste to choose one , ended up with something akin to sleeping on a cement slab.After a thorough search , I chose this topper and is truly a lovely experience ! It added enough cushioning to offset the new extra firm mattress and was a dream to sleep on . HIGHLY recommend !	1
My husband is a furnace AND with have a TempurPedic so it gets a bit warm in the bed . We searched for a & # 34 ; cooling & # 34 ; mattress topper and decided to try this bamboo topper because of the great reviews . We were not disappointed ... this topper is amazing ! It actually does have a cooling effect and it is extremely plush ( remember this when you purchase sheets ) .	1
We decided to buy this pad ( 2 of them ) for our split XL twin & # 34 ; King & # 34 ; sized adjustable bed . mainly because of the overwhelming high ratings on Amazon . We 've had them for a while now and they are extraordinary toppers allowing for abundant air circulation . Our mattresses are memory foam and as with many people tend to be quite hot . These toppers make our new bed nothing short of fantastic . amazon made the purchase easy as usual .	1
plush and stays in place.the elastic sides seem awfully fragile.no odor at all.fully covers a 60 x 80 queensize mattress.very cushy.it 's being used on a brand new cushion-firm mattress without a pillow top .	1
I was SUPER skeptical at first seeing this have 5 stars and thought that even the reviews were doctored . But i just had to try this . My previous purchase from amazon for a topper was really poor and it clumped . The first thing is the quality of this product is AMAZING the build quality excellent . And after my first nights sleep i can absolutely say even though the price put me off , this is DEFINITELY one of the best purchases i 've made on amazon . It made my tempurpedic mattress soft comfortable . LOVE IT .	1
I could n't be more pleased with this purchase ( along with the Density Visco 4 Pound Elastic Memory Foam Mattress Pad Bed Topper , 2-Inch Thick ) . I bought the set as a gift for my daughter and surprised her by putting the topper on while she was at work ( the foam was n't arriving until the next day ) . She felt a great difference with just the topper . When the foam arrived , we put it on together , and she called and raved about how much more comfortable her bed was and how well she slept . I decided that I would buy another set for a queen bed in my guest room . The packaging was incredible . When I opened the foam , there was absolutely NO odor and it laid flat immediately-perfect fit . Very , very satisfied with my purchases .	1
not cheap but a very nice product , well made , very comfortable , nice deep pockets so it fits thick mattresses , even thick mattresses with toppers added , good buy .	1
Great product , American made ! Owner emailed me to make sure I was satisfied . Made a difference . We can tell a difference ! Comfy	1
I have n't slept on this yet but it is most definitely a QUALITY mattress pad . If it feels half as good as it looks , I will be in heaven !	1
First off , I purchased this item because we have a king sized mattress that I find to be too firm and I was sleeping terribly ( note the mattress has no built-in pillow top ) . I bought this hoping it would add a little cushioning and make the mattress feel more plush . I knew it was not a true pillow topper , but I was n't sure how much padding I would need to address my problem . The pros of this are that it 's excellent quality and the price is unheard of for the level of quality . It 's soft and does add a little padding , but it 's not really going to change the overall feeling of your mattress . However , I ended up buying 2 & # 34 ; memory form and this is the PERFECT cover to put over the 2 & # 34 ; foam to keep it in place and add a little padding that makes the foam feel like it 's built into the mattress . So I highly recommend buying this as a plush mattress cover if you 're planning to add some memory foam to your mattress .	1
I chose this mattress topper ( or pad ) , because I have a very sensitive back . I have no idea what the mattresses are like at college , but having a soft bed like the one at home is VERY important to me . I bought it in XL Twin and I opened it to feel the material . It is SO soft and very plush . A great buy ! ! I also love the fact that it was made in the USA !	1
very pleased with this item ; added a lot of comfort to what was a very hard mattress . good option , fast delivery . i was pleased as was my guests .	1
It is beautifully constructed , made in the USA , fits my very fat mattress , and the best of all , had zero odor when opening the package . No weird smells from chemicals , just a perfect pad ready to go on the bed . Yes , the king size is huge and can not fit in my washer , but who cares ? It is such a high quality product . Thank you manufacturer !	1
perfectly comfortable fits mattress and stays in place	1
We have , like other reviewers , a memory foam mattress covered with a water-proof plastic zip up bag . If the memory foam gets wet , it 's done for , you ca n't get any liquid , whatever it is , out once they get wet . Well , the memory foam mattress did allow better comfort if you do n't mind the feeling of being in a crock pot on one side . The sheets were soaking wet no matter what we did , outside of sleeping nude with no covers . In desperation , thinking we made a mistake in buying a memory foam mattress , decided to see how to correct the problem . A friend who has a bamboo mattress pad on a regular mattress suggested it to us and the reviews here are correct . It does allow that part of you that is in contact with the bed to breath and you are cooler . I have found that on warm days I need to air the mattress pad in the morning because it has absorbed so much perspiration . We have an overhead fan , I simply turn it on high with the sheets pulled back for ten or fifteen minutes and that is enough to dry out the pad before making the bed .	1
I had to replace my mattress pad , and after some deliberation , decided on the Extra Plush Bamboo Top Mattress Pad . This ended up being an excellent choice , in my opinion . It is quite plush and comfortable . It is very easy to put on , and has n't moved at all . After a month or so of use , it has n't shown any signs of wear-or-tear . I 'm very happy with my purchase and would recommend it to anyone who 's looking into this type of mattress pad . I 'm not sure how it compares to memory foam pads , as I have not tried those .	1
We just bought a mid range tempur pedic bed which is great , but my wife weighing only 120 lbs doesnt really sink into the bed like I do at 180 lbs and she has been complaining that her back is more sore than on our old spring pillow top mattress which was giving me horrible back pains . Anyways this Mattress Topper has solved that issue and I enjoy the extra softness as well ! It is definitely a cheaper alternative than returning our mattress and upgrading to one of the tempurpedic & # 34 ; cloud & # 34 ; series which basically just has a pillow top stitched onto their patented memory foam	1
I 've only used this mattress pad one night , and I had the best night 's sleep I 've had in months and months . This mattress pad is well worth the price . It by far out performs the two I 've purchased from WM and an another that was almost as expensive as this one that I purchased from a department store . My back felt better when I got up than it normally does . I have back problems , but they were n't as pronounced this morning as they normally are when I get up . Plus , there was a hand written & # 34 ; Thank you & # 34 ; from the company and a name and phone number to call if had any problems . That was a really , really nice touch . Well worth the price .	1
Feels amazing to sleep on . The mattress pad does n't get hot when sleeping on it , is plush and wonderful especially on a firm mattress . Make any matress as lush as a pillow top with a high quality mattress pad like this . Due to a random coincidence , I bought it during allergy season and woke up with a bloody nose the first night , and seeped into the pad . With a little stain remover it came right out with no trace . I 'd recommend this to anyone with a penchant for lush sleepy times .	1
This turned my comfortable bed into THE MOST comfortable bed in the world . I love it so much ! It did , however , rip a little on the very first wash. That is why I rated it a 4 instead if 5 . For the money you pay , it was disappointing that it ripped . Overall , though , it 's fabulous !	1
It is silky and plush and fits perfectly ! I 've tried mattress toppers ( the memory foam type ) and they just made my back hurt more . This mattress pad makes me LOVE my bed ! ! It 's just beyond awesome ! Worth every penny ! If I ever need to replace it , I 'm getting the same thing !	1
My main interest was trying to avoid the heat of my TempurPedic mattress , which I love except that it traps body heat . I purchased other mattress pads with no help in keeping me cool . I decided to try this pad , crossing my fingers , but not very hopeful , to solve the problem . IT WORKS PERFECTLY ! ! ! ! ! I sleep through the night and my memory foam is as cool in the morning as when I first laid down ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! Add to that , the luxurious softness of the bamboo filler , as well as the expertly sewn pad , and excellent cloth , as well as the part that fits down the mattress it stretchy and gives it a perfect fit , , and it screams quality and dreamy comfort . I 'll be buying this product for all my mattresses . And it 's made in the good old USA , by our fabulous veterans . PLUS , PLUS , PLUSSES ALL THE WAY AROUND . ++++++++	1
I bought this based on reviews and I 'm so glad I listened to them . This is by far one of the best mattress pads I 've ever had . My mattress is one of the original pillow tops , and is a very heavy . It 's also old , so it 's starting to sink down in some areas , even though we turn it . It had got to the point that I was very uncomfortable and would toss and turn many times . I put this mattress pad on , and it feels like I 'm sleeping on a new mattress . One that feels soft , fluffy , and very comfortable . I 've slept much better since I started using this . It fits the thick mattress very well , the sides stretch just enough to fit the mattress , which was a plus right from the start . And you can tell this is a high quality item just by looking at it . The best part is that it 's made right here in the USA ! ! There was a hand written note from the owner of the company , which is probably a first for me . I highly recommend this mattress pad . It 's definitely worth the cost .	1
So relieved that this turned into exactly what the reviews said . We bought a new mattress without a pillow top for a change . It was also a firm mattress . Doing some research I found that pillow top mattresses add heat to your body as well as foam pads . The pockets on this pad are deep enough that it actually fitted to underneath our mattress . ( New mattress is thicker with gel foam and memory foam in its core ! ) Very breathable and most essentially gave the added touch of sliding into sleep with some softness on a cloud . Thank you other reviewers for giving adequate feedback ! ! ! ! !	1
We just bought a new mattress . It 's nice , but not that sinking into a cloud feeling I really wanted . This was the key . We bought this pad hoping it would be just the right amount of cushioning without causing us to overheat like memory foam can . We have had it a while now , and I love it . It 's everything it promised to be . No dips or uneven areas . Highly recommend .	1
We really love our memory foam mattress , but living in a humid environment it 's been a little bit too hot lately . We bought this fitted topper mostly to help with the temperature , but wow is it comfortable.An already amazing bed got more comfortable , less hot and just better with this topper . Highly recommend it .	1
My 4-inch memory foam topper is wonderful , as it is very comfortable . But - I decided it needed a little extra support , something not usually found in memory foam . This Extra Plush Bamboo Pad fit the bill . It provides the support needed while being super comfortable at the same time . It is well-made and has a deep pocket that completely encases my original queen-size mattress , plus memory foam topper and has room to spare . It is also very attractive for a mattress pad and adds the extra one and a half inches in height that I needed to fit my bedspread perfectly . I now feel like I am sleeping on a very expensive mattress - memory foam comfort with the topper and just the right amount of support with this luxurious mattress pad ! Great combination !	1
Checked many reviews before purchasing this mattress pad . Had been experiencing night sweats and this bamboo mattress pad is cooler than my previous mattress pad . Would purchase again !	1
This is hands down the best manual can opener I ever had . I did n't expect much even with the good reviews on amazon , but I 'm impressed . I 'm glad such quality products are still being manufactured in our era of cheap and cheaply made chinese `` goods '' . I plan on buying more to give as gifts . Just keep them dry and hopefully they will last a very long time .	1
This is a great can opener for the money . Opens can with a smooth twist of the knob . It has worked every time without a problem . I also love that I am supporting USA companies which is so important for our nation . I highly recommend this opener .	1
I love the functionality -- it 's all they claim ( thank goodness ! ) . Since this one is so great I feel bad not giving 5 stars . However they tel the truth -- DO NOT put it in a dishwasher or soak it . The rivet ( at least ) will rust that fast . So 4 stars -- please consider changing to rustproof rivets ! I 've paid $ 8 - $ 11 for product that can rust . I 'd pay more for rustrproof.So far as opening : O M G thank you ! I 've had 3 or so knock offs ( imports ) that could n't open a can without skipped spots or trying to climb over the rim .	1
my battery operated can opener , the one that sits on a can and `` walks '' around it finally died . I needed a can opener but was n't really wanting a countertop style because it takes up my precious counter space . I decided to go with this one because of the reviews . They were right . nice and sturdy , good quality and simple and smooth cutting .	1
We love these can openers ! If you look , you can also find made in the USA garden hand tools . One .	1
I have a vacation rental and renters broke two other can openers in the span of 1 year . This thing should last forever .	1
I had n't realized how dull my old swing-away had become until it started skipping . I was going to try something new , but got this and I 'm so glad I did . Inexpensive , and it works very smoothly and effortlessly . No fuss , just gets the job done efficiently .	1
It 's a big deal to me that it 's made in the USA . It 's also the best one out there . It 's exactly like my old Swing-A-Way that I had worn out after many years .	1
I ordered this to replace one I had so long it was rusting . This new one works better than the old one ever did . Great choice and made in USA , that was something I was looking for .	1
This opener is a sturdy weight and has a handle that turns easily . Most importantly , it is made in the USA !	1
You know , I have been buying the Farberware brand at Walmart , and that piece of junk rusts , bends and gets dull in just a few months . This has n't so far . It is SMOOTH opening a can . Should have purchased 2 at that price .	1
I bought one of these can openers for my parents who were struggling with a failing can opener made by one of the big box kitchen utensil companies . This thing has been going strong for well over a year with no signs of failure so I bought one for myself . Just by comparing it to the cheaper ones ( that actually cost MORE at the big box stores ) you can see the differences in construction and can see why this one will last a lot longer . The rivets and gears that make this thing work are held in place with metal , not the cheap plastic seen in the lower quality ones . Highly recommended .	1
I have had this can opener now for over 12 months . That said I probably only use it three or four times a week . It opens the cans flawlessly and does not & # 34 ; slip & # 34 ; or skip when winding the handle . It is comfortable to use with the & # 34 ; thickened & # 34 ; plastic rounded handle overlays ( the clamping handles ) . The & # 34 ; turning & # 34 ; handle ( just metal ) is broad and also has a good feel without any pressure points on your fingers . The opener still feels precise and well made and has a nice heavy feel about it . It feels like a USA made product , & # 34 ; built like a tank & # 34 ; and I expect it will last a few years more . It opens all the various , ordinary supermarket source cans I use without a fuss and it did not cost a fortune !	1
Sooo happy with this can opener . Think about it . If you have an electric can opener and the electricity goes out for whatever reason ? I have bought so many cheap junk hand can openers that I finally decided to cave and find a nice one on Amazon . It was a great price too .	1
Good , quality product . Great feel . Go America ! Go America ! Go America ! Go America ! Go America ! Go America ! Go America ! Go America !	1
This opener works great and is made in the USA . It opens cans with little effort and it appears to be well made .	1
We use a bag inside these and use them over and over . Unfortunately , a bag fell inside and our old ones were ruined . Party City only sells these during the summer but we had a party coming up in the fall . Amazon came to the rescue again . After the party , we just flatten them , put a rubber band around them , and store them with the other party goods . Highly recommend	1
I 'm still getting used to these towels . We 're used to the terrycloth variety ; these are stiffer and smaller , but we 're not sure they 're as efficient as the standard towels we 'd been using .	1
These towels are perfect for my kitchen update . The fabric is perfect and the colors are true red . Wash nicely and minimal shrinkage .	1
Since my youngest daughter STOLE my masher awhile ago , and still to this day denies she has it - I was forced to break down and buy a new one . I 'm a fan of KitchenAid and this masher holds up to the name . Not sure what else there is to be said - have washed it in the dishwasher , no issues . It mashes well . I think I will have to find a hiding spot for this one so my other two daughters do n't come after it !	1
Nothing special with these . They do what they are supposed to do . Plain and simple bright green plastic measuring cups .	1
First , I LOVE the color -- the bright green is what drew me to these in the first place . Finding out they were more Eco-friendly than your average plastic was a nice bonus , too . But what really makes these special is the variety of measurements : -1 Tablespoon-1/2 Tablespoon-1 Teaspoon-1/2 Teaspoon-1/3 Teaspoon-1/4 TeaspoonI 've always had to guess at the half tablespoon , because none of my past sets had one . And with as much as I play with recipe sizes ( sites like AllRecipes.com will adjust the recipes up or down according to how many servings you want , but that makes for some non-standard measurements ) , the 1/3 teaspoon will come in handy as well.Last , but not least , the measurements are raised , not printed , so they 'll never wear off .	1
I love the Eco-friendly material of the BioChef measuring spoons , and I was pleasantly surprised at how durable they felt . The spoons are a nice size and store much easier than my previous set . The fit nicely inside eachother and store in tight spaces ( like my kitchen drawers ! ) . I like the bowl shape of these measuring spoons vs a square bottom that my older set had . It looks better , and I found it much easier to clean them .	1
My drawer of kitchen gadgets tends to get a bit cluttered and messy , these bright green measuring spoons are easy to find and they have n't stained yet even when using them with pigments and colorants . Perhaps I should have abandoned the traditional white measuring spoons long ago .	1
Dishwasher safe , flashy color , and a ring to keep them all together ! The only thing I do n't like is the design of the ring -- if you want one in the middle , you have to take them all off the ring . Otherwise , I 'm really happy !	1
What can one say about measuring spoons , really ? Well , they are a pretty color , easy to spot in a drawer . They do not fall off the ring which is a major peeve of mine , easy to use , dishwasher safe and feature a lot of different sizes/measures . Also , price was right . So I guess there are very nice things to say about measuring spoons : - )	1
These are nice , heavy weight flannel sheets - true to size . They wash and dry well with very little shrinkage .	1
This sheet set is one of the best we have purchased . I like the colors and pattern . They fit the mattress very good after washing . There was n't much shrinkage , which I a appreciated .	1
I found these sheets to perform well and as advertised . I have not had the problems some people have referred to on here .	1
I do n't like heavy flannel sheets because they make me swear [ that too , but I meant to say sweat ] . These are just right . Not too thin , and yet cozy soft and warm . Easy to care for too .	1
These flannel sheets are so warm and soft . They have a beautiful design and look wonderful and classy on the bed	1
We have a few sets of flannel sheets from LL beans and others at more that double the price . With out going into some long drawn out reviews these are just as good as more expensive ones . Time well tell how they hold up , but so far they are fine	1
At first , this mat is HUGE and was worried it 's too big . But once we tried it , yes it 's big but not too big . The color is very nice , light pastel cream . I use this under my drying rack , and it has a couple of inches of 'padding ' . My other standard mat , has no extra padding so it fits `` exactly '' under my drying rack . I like this one better , and it was cheaper than the smaller mat i have !	1
one weekend and liked how versatile it seemed to be and commenced looking for it upon returning home . Found them on Amazon and discovered a couple of sizes , could n't decide on one so I bought both sizes . Arrived quickly ( Amazon Prime ) and we absolutely love them .	1
I was looking for a microfiber mat to put on my window sill to absorb the water that leaks in when it 's raining . This is how I came across this wondrous drying mat . I have an old Rubbermaid rubber drain tray which is no llonger being manufactured . The drain on it empties out to the sink as any drain should . The new one empties out toward you which is so ridiculous as I have yet to see a sink where this can be used . I take such fastidious care of this old drain board . Puddles of water are wiped off at the end of every day along with the lint and crumbs that accumulate . It is slowly getting discolored and then to my amazement I read about this mat being used by others instead of a drain board . After reading the very positive reviews I thought this must be a select group of people as how could this be . The mat must get soaking wet and particles must stick to it . I ordered it for my window sill but when I received it I put it on top of my old drainboard under the dish rack . It fits perfectly . The water gets absorbed very quickly and only gets damp not soaking wet because of the excellent absorbtion , If I leave the house for a few hours it is dry when I get back . It dries overnight , it 's MAGIC ; - ) Any lint or food particles are easily wisked off with my hand but the fantastic Scrub Daddy sponge works the best and leaves the mat absolutely spotless and this is on black which shows everything . .Microfiber is a fantastic fabric.I can now keep my obsolete Rubbermaid drainboard as it is well protected . I ca n't recommend this this little miracle mat highly enough . If you 've gotten this far and read my entire review I thank you for your time for `` listening '' to my drawn out story about a simple small black mat that has made me very happy .	1
I had full intentions of using this as advertised . Then I got the box from Amazon . As usual the cats were extremely excited to see the box , and planning how they would use it as a fort . THEN they noticed this Drying mat , Game over ... It would work perfect for anyone that 's going to use it for the actual purpose , but regardless of where I out it the damn fuzzballs find it , and curl up on it .	1
I bought one for my son , then now for me . This soaks up so much water and does stink and get ransit after awhile . Do n't know why I waited so long to get one for us here at home , but & # 34 ; better late than never & # 34 ; my husband always says . I recommend this dish drying mat to everyone . I bought the black dish drying mat for my son and did n't like tit that it showed every piece of lint on it so I purchased the cread dish drying mat for my husband and I .	1
This is a great item to have in the kitchen , no more drain board for me , they always got on my nerves trying to keep it clean , I put it in the washing machine and dryer.I have more than one , I use it to dry fruits and veggies .	1
I have only had it for a short while , but it goes great under my bamboo folding dishrack . Love it !	1
Cute little magnets for your fridge . Great for the price . Hold everything to the fridge you need to be on there .	1
My daughter collects owls and has these on her fridge . She really adores them ! They are so cute . They looked much better than depicted on Amazon !	1
I just adore this magnet set ! It looks so cute in my kitchen on my refrigerator ! I wish they were a bit bigger though .	1
Bought these to put in my daughters christmas stocking . They are really cute and she loves playing with them . When you take them out of the package , they are all on one sheet and you have to pop them out ( kind of like stickers ) . But overall very easy and fun ! !	1
I ordered these bags a few weeks ago . They work just fine ... I recommend them . The price is reasonable and they certainly do the trick .	1
I have n't used these vacuum cleaner bags yet , but I was amazed at how quickly they were shipped ! If they are like the bag that came in the vacuum cleaner that I also purchased I will be extremely satisfied . It was much cheaper to buy through Amazon than at the local store .	1
This is the best bag I have found for using with theHoover Tempo Widepath Upright Vacuum , Bagged , U5140-900 . They fit perfectly and hold everything inside no matter how small the particles.There is a white sticker type flap on each bag that you can use to tape over the opening after you have filled it up . This will prevent any dust/dirt from escaping out in a plume if it 's just tossed into a trash can and someone tries to compact/squish down the garbage . It 's forgiving when it comes to being overfilled as well . It keeps packing it in even if it 's filled to the top.Good basic vacuum bags at an affordable price .	1
Great value for the price - far better than buying the smaller unit packages from the bog box stores . The per unit price is far less than a dollar - great deal .	1
Very good value for the price paid . Probably wont have to buy bags for a long time as these came in a multi pack .	1
I purchased these bags a couple of years ago for my Hoover wind tunnel . They work as well asthe bag which arrived with the vacuum at an excellent price . The quality is great and trouble free .	1
These are great bags and a wonderful value . I can hardly find them in a store any more , so I was very happy to find them online and at huge savings . I will keep ordering these !	1
These are very high-quality bags , and they will work great for my vacuum .	1
They work good and fit thank you , easy to put in would buy again like to keep on hand . I 'd say buy .	1
These are decent bags and they are much less expensive than the Hoover bags . They seem to work just fine . I recommend them .	1
These bags are great and worked perfect for my Hoover WindTunnel Vacuum ( Type Y bag type ) . The package I received was ** EnviroCare ** . These are excellent bags that look and feel almost exactly like the Hoover bags I was previously using . The only difference is that EnviroCare bags have a seal that can be used once the bag is full to prevent the dust from leaking out during transport to the garbage.The bags themselves performed pretty much the same as the previous bags I had . However , I did notice the Envirocare bags seem just a little bit smaller than the standard Hoover bags ( about 0.5 in less length when comparing them unused ) . While this translates to the bag filling up a little faster than your standard Hoover bag , odds are you are paying much less per bag than using the name brand.OVERALL , the Envirocare bags are exceptional and make a great Generic Alternative to the standard Hoover bags . They work as advertised and will end up saving you some money in the end , while helping to keep your house clean . **NOTE : Make sure you get Envirocare brand when you purchase . As other reviews have pointed out it seems a variety of generics are floating around amongst the venders . You want the Envirocare bags as they pretty much look and FEEL like the Hoover Bags I got with my Vacuum . Some of the cheaper generics out there will not hold up nearly as well , and are often thinner which could lead to the bag bursting .	1
Just kidding , I just wanted to be silly for a minute ! They 're vacuum cleaner bags , what can I say , in all fairness ? They fit snuggly , they 're the fancy micro-filtration bags so you wo n't have dust and mites going up your nose ( allegedly ) , that 's a good thing , right ?	1
Great quality and fast delivery time.I have ordered from this company twice and will continue in the future .	1
How do you rate a vacuum bag as 5 star ? I like it , but do n't love it however that has nothing to do with the product . Seller was great , packaging was good and shipping was quick . Serves it 's purpose .	1
I went to a local supercenter to pick up some new bags for our WindTunnel and found out that they were going to cost $ 3 per bag ! I decided there had to be a cheaper option and came home to check on Amazon . These bags were literally less than 1/3 the cost and they appear to actually be of better quality than the `` name '' brand bags . At less than $ 1 per bag , I 'll definitely be buying more from Amazon !	1
They are vacuum bags . They fit and they work . What more can you want ? Man I hate this min word requirement .	1
Purchased these bags with new hoover upright and we are pleased with their performance . Will purchase again when the need arises .	1
What can I say , easy to use and work great . Love the sticker cover for the hole in the back when it 's full . Makes clean up a breeze and mess free . Good price . Do n't have to hunt them down in the stores , I can just order on-line when I 'm ready for more .	1
Works great with our widepath tempo model number U5140-900 . A very cheap but quality product . Why pay full retail price for anything ? Will buy again when we run out - 9 bags was a great amount , should last 1-2 years .	1
There is little information easily available to figure out which vacuum uses which bag . The Hoover Tempo Widepath U5140-900 bagged upright vacuum came with this bag , and fortunately , it is the same bag that my old Hoover Wind Tunnel also used . Never had any problem with them over a period of eight years . They are sturdy and reliable , not bursting suddenly and flooding the room with dirt , when used properly . Highly recommended .	1
I can find only a limited selection of vacuum bags in my local stores , so when I found them on line , and at such a great price , I was thrilled . Now I only get them from online sources . I change my bags often , and I think paying $ 3 a bag is ridiculous . These bags work great and I can buy them from home .	1
These bags work quite well and are a real value . Pick up some . I was n't disappointed , and you wo n't be either .	1
we just bought a 4 gallon wet/dry vac for our pellet shove to vacume it out an these work great . you vacume out the ash and it goes into the bag and is so easy to despose of . great price , good quality ,	1
It 's hard to get too excited about vacuum replacement bags . They fit properly , are reasonably easy to put on and take off and seem to do a good job controlling dust emissions . I will buy more when I need them .	1
I will never buy another vacuum bag as long as these exist ! I have 2 dogs and 2 cats , so I have to vacuum ALOT and these have completely changed how well our vacuum works . The light on our Windtunnel vacuum that senses dirt , gets and stays to green much longer , so I am not having to go over areas as much . My sinuses arent bothering me as much after cleaning . It 's crazy one could like a vacuum bag this much , haha ! Oh , and the price is amazing for the quantity !	1
Pros-Good value or 9 bags-Microfiltration so no sneezing when vacuuming-Easy to changeNothing else to say really , they are vacuum bags !	1
I bought these bags the same time I bought the Hoover Tempo Vacuum . I am very happy that I did . They are alot cheaper than the Hoover bags and they work very well . You get 9 bags for only $ 9.50 If you buy with the Vacuum the shipping is FREE ! !	1
The Hoover Wind Tunnel Upright Type Y Vacuum Bags with Microfiltration with Closure are easy to use . I feel very comfortable using these bags because they are sturdy and so far we have n't ever had one of their bags break . I really like the Microfiltration down to 99 % as it picks up every tiny particle which means the carpets are clean when done vacuuming . I really like these bags and will continue purchasing them . I recommend the Hoover brand type of bags for a peace of mind that the bag wo n't break , at least , they have n't broken for me .	1
I chose these bags over genuine Hoover based on price and my previous experience with Envirocare bags for previous Hoovers and Eurekas . These bags fit my new Hoover Max , and because of their low price , I wo n't feel badly about changing them more often.Side by side with the genuine Hoover bag , it 's obvious by appearance , feel , and construction that the Envirocare is the pretender . However the bags fit , and without a sophisticated air testing device , I can only hope that these bags filter the air as well as claimed and are at least close to the real deal in effectiveness .	1
This is my 2nd order for these bags ... ..they are wonderful ! I have asthma/COPD and these bags have certainly helped my allergy issues ... .if you vacuum often , you eliminate dust mites and other allergens in your home . There really is a difference in just a regular bag and these . These are thick and stronger than ordinary bags . I think they are very reasonable in cost and are shipped super fast to your home ! I will definitely continue to order these !	1
We are delighted with our new Hoover WindTunnel Upright vacuum . It was easy to order this first set of vacuum bags to accompany the arrival of the vacuum . The bags are well-matched to the vacuum , so the entire unit is working nicely .	1
These were bought on price . And the price was significantly better than local retail . Plus , the locals were often out of stock . I prefer to buy in quantity for a better price and this item was available in that manner .	1
I think these are a good deal and the fact prime is around I can cut errands out of my week for the samller specialty items .	1
The quality of these bags is just as equal to or better in our opinion to the national brand at a much better price . We have been ordering these bags for 2 years now and have not had a single problem .	1
If you like good tasting coffee -- - change your filters regularly . Good price for keeping up the maintenance . 2 year supply ( Based on recommendation every 2 months . )	1
I bought this a long time ago for myself and most recently for a friend as a gift . Easy to use for that single cup of coffee that you want when you only have a few minutes to make one . The newer version seems to look a lot nicer than my old one but they both seem to work the same . I may just have to drop mine on the floor and break it a few weeks before Xmas and add it to my wishlist . The price seems to be just about what any member of my family would spend for a simple gift .	1
The Aeropress has changed the coffee experience for me . I used to drink it a few times a year with lots of sugar and cream . I found that I prefer coffee from the Aeropress with no cream ( though I still use sugar ) , because the flavor is good . If you want an easy-to-clean , simple , environmentally sound ( no paper waste ) , lower-acid way of making one to four cups of coffee , you will like this product . It came not only with the stainless steel filter , but also with paper filters .	1
This is the first high end series of pots I have in my house . I received the 2 larger sized as a gift and after using them once I immediatly bought the smaller one . Love that they coolk evenly and quickly , they are also very easy to clean and if needed can go in the dishwasher .	1
I bought this after trying a set of two frying pans of the same brand and type and being really pleased with them . I have an induction cooktop which is super fast , and I have been using the high end , super expensive Demeyere pans , which I love . So when I needed one more saucepan I decided to go with this make since the frying pans compared very favorably with the Demeyere.This saucepan is no exception . It heats up quickly and evenly , the lid is really nice - I particularly like the glass center so I do n't have to keep lifting it to see what 's going on ! Some people think that $ 80 for a pan is expensive , but you get what you pay for and this is worth every cent.I will just tell you though , I first ordered the small , 1 quart because the measurements stated were the ones I was looking for . When it arrived it was way too tiny . So when I looked again I saw that the measurements are the same for each size pan ! But no problem , Amazon 's customer service is second to none and I quickly got the 2 quart one instead .	1
I come from the Middle East and we eat a lot of rice . No other pot compares to this . Amazon should send me a whole set of Henckels Spirit Thermolon for all the people I 've referred who 've bought this pricey but worth-every-penny pan.Many people have a very hard time cooking rice properly . My food/memoir blog has a recipe for perfect rice every time . You can find it here : [ ... ] By the way , the very best rice you can buy is Roland Fragrant Jasmine Rice , 20-Pounds Bag , available at Amazon .	1
I love this little sauce pan ! It 's the perfect size for melting butter or a small amount of sauce , which I often cook just for myself . I love the heavy material , design and compact lid . My only issue is the first time we used it , we could not get the tomato sauce stain cleaned from it . We tried for 20 minutes by hand and also put it in the dishwasher . I used it again the next day and put it in the dishwasher again , and it did clean up .	1
It fits great and got here fairly fast . It seems to be made out of quality material and fits great .	1
I was shocked that it not only worked but works very well . Just make sure you do n't use past it 's prime . Great size as I do n't think the Jr could handle my lung capacity.Will buy again and recommend to others .	1
Smoke now wherever you want ! It honestly does the trick and the description of the product does not lie ! One tip , make sure when you exhale your mouth is secured around so non of the marry j leaks out ! enjoy !	1
Works perfect is the only thing to say about this product when Ineed a new one i will get another ! ! !	1
I believe I found one way to extend their lives , and all one needs is a Shop-Vac ( or similar powerful vacuum ) .Hold the hose from the Shop-Vac just inside the intake opening ( where you 'd put your mouth , the smaller opening ) and fire up the vacuum . Do n't let the vacuum hose touch the charcoal filter . Just hold it there sucking from the intake opening ... remember , *not* the exhaust opening on the Smoke Buddy.Any luck ? It seemed to work on mine .	1
This table runner is a perfect addition to the eight matching placemats I 've purchased for my son & grandson 's kitchen table . The colors are spectacular & very vibrant ; perfect for the Christmas holiday season . Adds such beauty and warmth to any table setting ! You will NOT be disappointed with the table runner or the matching placemats .	1
I ca n't say enough good things about this trash can ! I love that it is the perfect combination of functionality and design . Functionally , the sensor feature is great for when I 'm rushing around and want to be able to trash things quickly without bothering with opening the can or stepping on a peddle . I also love that while they do make special bags for the can , it works equally well with your standard trash bag . I previously owned a store brand stainless steel trash can from Target and found that the way the inside was put together the bag would frequently catch on the seams . I have not had this problem at all with this new can and also love that the lip of the lid is long enough that I can fold the trash bag around the sides of the can without it hanging over the sides . And a bonus as a pet owner , the way the lid shuts it is not possible for my small dog ( 20 lbs ) to open it , vs. with my previous can it was pretty easy for him to lift the lid and go rooting around . Problem solved ! I also find this can to be lovely esthetic wise . The finger-proof brushed stainless is lovely because it means it looks brand new even with frequent use . I also like how it is just big enough that I 'm not constantly rushing to the dumpster but small enough that I can keep it in plain sight without it being an eyesore . It sits nicely near flush against the wall taking up very little space.Overall it 's a lovely can that functionally does the job while also being something I 'm proud to have visible in my kitchen .	1
This is quite a nice trash can.It 's one of those smaller kitchen trash cans , and I think it 's the perfect size , as by the time you 've filled it , it 's time to move the trash outside.Setting it up out of the box took about thirty seconds . It requires six C cell batteries . Install those and stick a liner in , and it 's ready to go . The sensor is intuitive and works exactly as I 'd want it to , both when briefly putting trash in and when I would like the lid to stay open for a long period of time . I 'm very impressed with this aspect . It makes a faint mechanical noise when opening and closing , which is quieter than my conventional trash can ( which is nearly identical aside from lacking sensors and motors ) .The metal does resist marks , and the plastic parts around the can are high quality and durable . It 's easy to clean . I have no problem with the construction quality . I will update if there are any reliability issues.When I realized the price of this product , before it arrived in the mail , I was skeptical that I would find it to be a good value , but using this so far has convinced me that the convenience of not having to touch my trash can is worth a bit of a premium.I have no qualms at all about the unit . I think it 's four star ( good ) value.Update : Unfortunately , my trash can no longer opens and closes reliably . I left the outer lid open for nine hours ( you raise the outer circle to remove the trash bag , as I did on trash day , and I then went to work ) . When I came home and put a new bag in , the lid stared making a clicking noise . It can open and close , but not reliably . I loved this can up to this point , so just be careful not to leave the outer circle open all day . I 'm not going to deduct any stars from the rating as I kinda think this is my fault , but I wanted to note the issue .	1
***UPDATE 3/13***This can has done a great job . It still works very well . We 've changed the batteries twice so far . It does tend to open as you walk past but that is also because we have it at a prime traffic area . It has not failed yet . I really like that I can have my hands full of yucky stuff and not have to touch anything to get it open and it stays open as long as you need . Still recommended ! *************I had an automatic trash can before ( different manufacturer ) that pooped out after a few months . So time will tell on this one.This can has a great semi-circle design which allows it to tuck in under a cabinet or sit fairly flush against a wall.The sensor is great although we often open the can by walking past it . It is pretty quiet and opens with a little wooosh . It remains opens for an adequate time and stays open if you are working above it.It takes 6 'C ' batteries ( not included ) so I hope they last awhile ! I really like the fingerprint proof finish . My previous stainless steel can was always looking streaky and smudged.It is a little smaller than our previous can but it still uses a standard tall kitchen garbage bag.A nice trash can with a larger price tag . If the hands free is worth it to you , the rest of the can is nicely finished .	1
I did n't notice that this was only a 12 gallon trash can while most trash cans are at least 13-gallon or more . We are a 4 person family and I could imagine having to change the bag maybe twice a day if we used it for our main kitchen trash can . However , I came up with a great solution ! I have a very large main bathroom upstairs that has double sinks in the first room and the tub and toilet in the next room . ( My husband uses the full bath off the family room ) . With 3 females in the house , the tiny waste basket in our bathroom has to be emptied daily and the contents are very visible to everyone that uses the bathroom . So , I put this hands-free trash can in the bathroom ! It 's within reach of the toilet and being hands-free , nobody has to touch the lid !	1
This simplehuman trash can is a bit of an odd size - 45 liters is a bit less than a standard `` tall kitchen '' container , which is typically 49 liters . simplehuman wants you to use their special bags , which cost about 40 cents each , or somewhat less in larger quantities . The simplehuman bags are claimed to fit the can well with the top of the bag hidden by the can 's lid . That is true , but you have to fiddle with the bag a bit to make it so . Though their bags are quite nice , thick and with a drawstring tie , I found that a supermarket Glad tall kitchen bag will also fit , though it 's a tiny bit short - probably not enough to pose a problem . Three simplehuman size `` M '' bags are included with the can - Amazon also carries them : simplehuman Custom Fit Trash Can Liner M , 45 Liters / 12 Gallons , 50-CountThey are available in various quantities and in an `` OdorSorb '' variant.The can itself is attractive - the brushed stainless steel surface is said to not show fingerprints , and that seems to be the case . The self-opening/closing top works on 6 C-cell batteries ( not included ) , which are said to last about a year . The mechanism works well , with some smarts that if it senses you are working above the can , it delays closing the top . The opening and closing is quiet . I have to wonder , though , if this automation is really necessary - is there something wrong with a step-on mechanism ? The can is reasonably lightweight and stable , perhaps more so than a plastic can of the same dimensions would be .	1
The simplehuman sensor trash can is a really nice product . We replaced an existing sensor trash can with the simplehuman and there is really no comparison . Hands down the simplehuman is better . It is the perfect size 2 or 3 person home and has a modern look that fits well in a kitchen with stainless steel appliances . The sensor is spot on and opens when you expect it to and does n't close before you are ready . We are very impressed with the way it contains odors and my husband 's favorite feature is that the lid is engineered in a way that he does n't need to remove it to change the trash bag as he had to with our old can . If you are looking for a sensor trash can , do n't hesitate to buy this one .	1
So back in Mar 2013 I moved into a house ( apartment living before ) and was excited to finally get a bigger trash can . Yay ! No more tiny little basket under the kitchen sink ; - ) . While out shopping for one , I had every intention of buying a Simplehuman can - had one before and I like the look , like the stainless steel coolness - but wanted one with the step-on-the-lever-and-open-the-lid variety . Yep , that 's what I really wanted because I love being able to open the lid hands-free , just using my feet.Unfortunately ( or fortunately ? ) I took my daughter with me and she spotted this sensor can . I 'll admit , I had fun playing with the store model ( she did too , we did n't want to leave ) and we took turns waving our hands over it and watching it open & close . Worked like a charm ! And that 's when I fell in love . But just like any new relationship , there were bumps ahead.I experienced the darn ! -I-just-walked-by-you-and-you-opened phase ( so I moved it ) and the I-just-don't-feel-like-working-on-the-relationship phase in which I had to manually close the darn lid . Then came the I-should-have-bought-the-step-kind thoughts ... I had to return this one . But because my daughter chose this sensor type and hey , why not give it another try ? - I got another sensor can . This one worked much better ! I still have the occasional what's-wrong-with-you-today ! moments , but this trash can has trained me to hover my hand over the lid on every trash can -- then comes the moment of clarity that I 'm not in my kitchen and this is n't my beloved can : - ) So , most of the time it works , sometimes it does n't ( 3 months later and I need new batteries ) , but I found I really like the sensor and worth the 6 C batteries and the occasional argh ! -just-close-already ! moments .	1
I 'm very pleased with this purchase , it looks just a pictured . The material is sturdy and the print is good . It 's a nice , affordable holiday accent .	1
It is adorable ! The fabric is thick and well made , stain resistant . I would buy lots of these for gifts . I love it ! !	1
My husband is very critical when it comes to coffee and coffee makers . He 's not a fan of regular coffee pots and he refuses to use a Keurig because it does n't make enough coffee and `` it 's never hot enough . '' For Christmas 2012 , I bought him this Kitchenaid Personal Single Serve Coffee Maker and the Hamilton Beach 49981 Single Serve Scoop Coffee Maker for him to choose from . He chose this one because it makes 18oz ( vs the 14oz in the Hamilton Beach ) and he has raved about it ever since . He says it makes a very hot , flavorful cup of coffee . He has used it at least twice a day for the past 8 months and it 's still going strong . Honestly , even if it stops working at this point , I think we got our money 's worth as I bought it from BB & B with a 20 % off coupon so that 's a LOT cheaper than $ 28-35 per week at a coffee shop .	1
It 's a very convenient way to make the good coffee , grab it and go in the mornings . It 's a fresh mug of coffee when you need it .	1
Much nicer in person . Has a frilly and feminine flair ! Look 's really good ! My wife flipped when it was hung up.Very nice !	1
This heater really works well , especially as there are two heat settings , and the heat comes out the bottom of the unit ( to warm your feet and legs ) instead of out the top . The heater is easily movable from room to room and is freestanding . But I have it installed in my fireplace . The fire effect is a bit heavy on the logs and a bit light on the flames , but it is really a very neat heater ! I 'm very happy with this item , and highly recommend it !	1
The Frigidaire Dallas Floor Standing Fireplace is a portable unit with very realistic looking flames . In addition , it was simple to use right out of the box and the directions accompanying the product well written and easy to understand . No assembly is required for this unit ! The unit can be used to provide just the ambience of a fireplace , inserted into an existing fireplace opening ( the unit measures : 21.8 '' x 6.5 '' x 19.5 '' ) . This model sits on legs ( already attached ) and the plug has a flat surface so it will hug an outlet . When set to warming , it throws off an amazing amount of warmth for such a small unit and draws a max of 1400 watts on its higher setting or 700 Watts on its lower setting for heat . It has a built-in overheating protection as well as an auto shut-off safety featureOf interest to many consumers is the country of manufacture of the product ; this unit is manufactured in China . It comes with a one-year warranty . Because the controls are mounted on the back of the unit , if it is placed in an existing opening of any type , the unit will have to be removed to turn it on or off or adjust it for just the glow or to provide warmth . That is a drawback to be noted . It is very light in weight and easy for me to lift and move . This will be a nice addition to any home or apartment where the appeal of a beautiful fireplace is desired .	1
This heater is the bomb ! I love it ! It 's very simple to operate ; there are three on/off power switches on the back . One for power which turns on the fire screen and the others for low heat or high heat . There are also two adjustment controls for dimming the fire and for temperature adjustment . It could n't be any easier.It 's effortless to carry from one room to the other by picking it up by the handles on each side of the unit . I think a handle on top would have been a nice plus but perhaps that would take away from the character of the design , *Simple and Smooth . * It does n't make too much noise on low and the heat flows out evenly across the bottom of the floor.But more than anything it 's aesthetically pleasing to both the eye and the soul . I suppose you could say it could be mesmerizing , especially if it 's the focal point of the room . I find it very calming and the dogs laid down in front of it and continued to watch the *flames* for an hour . It wo n't scare your pets . If you need a heater with a bit of pizzazz , this would be it . I 'm so impressed with new heater technology , this ai n't your grandmother 's old heater ! Highly recommended !	1
This is conveniently portable , you can carry it from one room to another , even if you have been using it for sometime . The heat is coming from the bottom and does n't heats up the handles that are on the top . It uses two 40W E12 lamps that can be replaced from the back.Pros : - wonderful magical fireplace display . It looks like an authentic fire unless you are very close to it.- no assembly requiredCons : - Not extremely loud but still makes noise even no heater is on.- No authentic fire log crackling noise . Fireplace DVDs give you better experience on audio.- It is blowing air on the bottom but not enough to spread the head across the roomEnergy consumption : I used a Kill-a-Watt to measure how much energy it consumes . This electronic fireplace has three rocker switches . The first one is for light display only . The other two switches is to turn on the heater . There are two rotating knobs . The one on the left is for the light display intensity . The one on the right is a dumb knob for the heater temperature . It is actually just a two step switch . It does n't adjust gradually . Nothing happens until you turn the knob past halfway before the light on the second heater switch turns on . After passing halfway , the heat will not intensify more even if you turn the knob all the way to the highest setting.Light only , dimmest setting = 53WLight only , brightest setting = 78WLight + 1 heater switch = 731WLight + 2 heater switches = 1,311W	1
I really like this tie rack . Sadly , the closets in my new flat fold when you open them and thus this no longer works for me . BUT , when it did , I like it . I managed to double up on most of the tie hangers . In the end , I do n't think there is a great tie rack option out there that does n't cost a 1st born child .	1
I love that this is over the door . I used to have one that secured to the wall , but this is just out of the way and does n't take wall space . Also does n't take closet space . Holds plenty of ties and love that it has the belt hooks too . I would definitely recommend this .	1
Finally a place for my husbands ties and belts where the ties do n't get crushed in his closet ! Works perfect ! !	1
Great for salads and huge batches of popcorn , and you can not go wrong on the price ! Highly recommend , although , if you are looking for a heavy duty stainless steel , this is n't it . Perfect for our needs and I assume most people . : )	1
I 've been thinking about trying out a bamboo bath mat for a while ... .so tired of constantly washing the cotton ones only to have them slowly develop holes etc . This has been a nice change . Its never cold and damp Its not as cold as the tile in my bathroom . Overall , I think its comfortable to stand on . Have only had this product for approximately 1 week , but I really really like it . Would recommend if you are looking for a change !	1
This product was true to its description , and I enjoy using it to step on when exiting the tub . It is sturdy and stable . I sometimes put a hand towel under it to catch drips and that works too .	1
This little tool reminds me of the ones we had when I was a small boy and we had an ICE BOX , not a refrigerator . The ice man came every day or so , and brought in whatever size hunk of ice we had requested by displaying a sign in our front window . ( My mother complained about the mess he made in front of the ice box , but that 's a different story . ) I use the ice pick when we buy bags of ice for a party or whatever , and the ice melts together and foms one big impossible hunk . It is a menacing-looking tool and requires care in it 's use , but it 's great !	1
The four stars are for me , I did n't mind the set up we had , but I can sleep practically on demand and am not fussy about the surface . My wife , on the other hand would give it five stars . After just the second night , she thought the first was a fluke , being able to sleep on both her back and sides for extended periods , she loves it . I does seem more form fitting than our previous Serta memory foam topper , and even close to the edge does n't lose support . It is still cold at nights so how cooling in the summer it is will remain to be seen , but so far , it performs as advertised and is a bargin to boot . By the way , the shipping was very fast as well .	1
Love this so much..Do n't know why we did n't purchase these mattress tops sooner . Have one for each bed now . So comfortable ! LOVE IT !	1
Despite shipping charges that seemed rediculous and despite never having slept on memory foam I trusted the reviewers who loved this topper . I can truly say that they were right and I am thrilled to have a new bed that now gives me a great night 's sleep . I was worried that foam would leave me in a hole and feeling hot . Well I enjoy the cradling feeling and at least during winter I like the reflective heat effect . In fact I had to turn down the thermostat which saves money in winter . The jury is still out for summer use . There is no smell and it fit my mattress perfectly.Update , July : While I am warmer in summer with this topper it is not enough to stop using it . It 's more comfortable with it than without it .	1
This topper is great . We just purchased a new mattresses set and wanted to extend it 's life so we purchased this topper . It is very comfortable and not hot at all . Would recommend to others . In fact purchased one for my Mother for her bed once she tried it and liked it .	1
It works very well in opening jars or bottles . I love it . IT OPENS JARS AS WELL AS POP BOTTLES with no problems at all	1
Very simple and better than big pliers-type or other mechanical devices . You get four of these grips , each about 4 & # 34 ; in diameter . That 's it . They greatly increase your grip and your ability to open jars or even small necked bottles . Could n't be better - or cheaper . Five stars it is .	1
These gripper pads work perfectly and are a real help to me . I used to have a smooth rubber one from the supermarket that was fairly good ... .these are SO much better . And to get four of them is brilliant .	1
Arrived quickly . I was able to open really tight lids with minimal strain to my hands . I did n't have to preheat the jar under hot water first . It grip does n't slip around the lid . Even though it is made of rubber , it did n't bother my skin . It 's easy to clean . So , it 's a keeper for me .	1
These are less expensive than official tiles , and while not pure white , they look fine . Especially if you 're working with colors and sepias .	1
I picked up a Sunbeam bread maker for $ 5 at a thrift store that was missing the paddle . Found the paddle on Amazon for less than five dollars . Total cost less than $ 10 for an almost brand new machine . Works terrific . I use it mainly for kneading dough . Still ca n't believe the deal on this .	1
I purchased this after the original disappeared in the garbage disposal . OOPS ! This one is actually easier than the original to remove from the shaft when cleaning !	1
We own a bakery and these are decent box , but they are a little on the pricey side for a thin cake box ... unfortunately , these types of boxes seem to alway be on the high side ... would be nice to find a reasonably priced box like this ... .Pizza boxes are basically the same thing ( just a different size obviously ) and they do n't cost this much even with the printing done on them ... ... go figure ...	1
Very nice sheets . The color is richer than in the photograph , and the deep pockets are a great fit for my mattress and toppers.I would definitely recommend these sheets .	1
Very nice , fits perfect washes great	1
Got these sheets in a couple of days after order and love them . Put them straight in the washer and washed them and put them on the bed . Love the feel of these and will sleep on them tonight for 1st time but know now that they are good sheets . Was a bit concerned with the 300 count but thought I would give them a try and so glad I did and will be ordering another set . Great price for the value .	1
I 'm a serious value shopper , and it 's seldom that I spend as much as this on a set of sheets . I think at most I have paid $ 20 for sheets in the past and of course have always gotten run-of-the-mill sheets . After seeing all the reviews here , I took a risk on these , my first new set of sheets in probably ten years . I bought a new memory foam mattress and wanted a nice set of sheets to go on them.Removing them from the package I was first impressed with the softness right out of the package . I was a little disappointed , somehow I had gotten the impression that these were Egyptian cotton , and when I saw that they were made in China I was a little let down . However , the sheets are beautifully made and very soft . As others have said , thread count can not be counted on as a reasonable predictor of softness . These are far softer than your average set of 300 TC sheets and the color is a deep jewel wine . They fit my 8 '' memory foam mattress with some room to spare , but I could see how they would not fit a thicker one like 12 '' or 14 '' . Still , I am a stickler for flat , fitted sheets and these laid flat without puckers or dimples.I will update when I have spent a night in them but so far , I count myself lucky not to have been fleeced like some of the other so-called `` Egyptian Cotton 1200+ TC '' sheets that turn out to be fraudulent . This is a good value for the money and I would buy again.I reserve a single star back from a five-star review because I do n't have enough information to give this a five star review yet ... but , if they perform as I expect , that will be the case .	1
Not as soft as something with double the thread count , but very comfortable and durable sheets . Fitted sheet is a little large for bed , requires extra tucking .	1
These sheets are not crisp . They are soft . They breathe well , and are gorgeous . They do seem to snag fairly easily , but not enough to make me want to stop using them .	1
Item comes with a pocket , the mattress cover , sheet and two pillow covers , it 's a really good deal for this set , the mattress cover was just fine for my queen guest bed , the sheet was also very comfortable.But the pillow covers seemed not that good looking after I put them on .	1
Call me a cynic but ... when something is priced more than two thirds below retail I begin to wonder ... .what 's wrong ? Are they discontinuing it ? Is there a flaw I will only find when I own them ? But I 'm wrong , they are great , comfortable sheets that do not require several trips though the laundry to & # 34 ; soften up & # 34 ; . I did n't use them straight from the package but did follow the laundering instructions and they came out exactly as I had hoped . The extra length on the side is appreciated as I have a thick mattress . You can-and I did-buy additional pillow cases but I 've come to expect one case per set of sheets . The final seal of approval came when , on the first day , my cats , always suspicious of anything new , hopped up and were immediately comfortable and asleep . Since I purchased these , I 've ordered another set in white and they 're just as good-I always worry that white might not wash out the various stains and & # 34 ; accidents & # 34 ; that befall all sheets but are more noticeable on white . As prove , I inadvertently sat on part of an & # 34 ; Almond Joy & # 34 ; bar and though there was a significant chocolate and coconut stain , one trip through the laundry removed it with no special pre-treating .	1
These are better than I had imagined ! They are soft , heavyweight , durable , well made sheets with ( thank goodness ) sufficient elasticity and deep pockets . They wash well , and fit perfectly . I love them !	1
I bought the deep maroon to use on a split cal king where each side adjusts independently . They are soft and silky . The only thing I could really complain about is that the stripes go different ways in each set . Not a big deal but It would have been nice , since I ordered two full sets to have them match .	1
I thought sage green would be a weird color for sheets but to mix and match with my cream sheets and choc brown sheets , I thought the color would make for a good mix of pillow cases . I was right ! I love these cotton sheets . I was afraid they would not be of good quality but they are a good value for the money . Do not be hesitant to order .	1
Damask-like finish , nice weight , excellent fit . I love the material and the all-around elastic on the fitted sheet . The pillow cases are nicely finished and roomy . I found this to be an outstanding bargain/value .	1
nice sheets	1
I bought these sheets for a teenager 's bed . They usually take a lot of abuse , so I did n't want to spend very much knowing I 'll most likely have to replace them soon anyway . This set of 300 thread count sheets were a great price even for cheap sheets . But when they arrived we were quite surprised at the quality . I do n't think I can count on the thread count in the future as a predictor of quality ! These sheets are smooth and are beautiful . Thank you !	1
the sheets fit our queen bed with deep pockets very good . They are soft and wash/dry great . I highly recommend	1
I had a pampered chef chopper for years and needed to replace it . I read a few reviews and decided to try this one out . I mostly chop things like onion or cauliflower with it . The blades rotate great when you 're testing it out , but as soon as I put some food beneath it , the blades stopped rotating . I gave it 2 weeks before I gave in and ordered the pampered chef one ( which is only a few dollars more anyway ) . I would n't waste my money again	-1
Seriously , the very first time I attempted to use the bare floor mechanism to stop the spinning brush when I tried to disengage it I heard a loud clunk . Done , no more stopping beater brush ! The lever just flops back and forth . It sucks ok , the `` power handheld attachment '' does stay magnetized fairly securely in storage when the vacuum is used . The retractable cord ( the feature I was most looking forward to ) does n't work fully . It took me about 8 tries to get it to retract the first time . Each attempt required me to fully pull the cord out and lay it straight away from the vacuum some 25 feet-or whatever it 's length actually is . I found the dilemma to be that the cord does not retract in a top/bottom repeating reel fashion , so that the cord gets overlapped too quickly and becomes too thick for there to be diameter space to accept more cord in the compartment holding the reel mechanism . I do like the vacuum 's low profile in front ; it both makes it easier to manuever and the vacuum feels as if it has much more direct contact with the floor surface-it is also quite low profile on the underside-floor side . Not enough height settings-I think only 3 . I 'd go check , but like I said the vacuum is already at the repair shop . The other part that broke first time out was the upright locking feature . The whole darn thing can barely stay upright-look at it wrong or let go too quick and bang ! -down she goes . I have the Eureka airspeed bagless and I like the bagless redesign on this model better . However , I am so done with bagless in general . I had bagless for the past year and a half and they clog up so fast , are extremely messy and time consuming to clean all the filters and costly to replace filters , and they STINK horribly . Ours needs to be cleaned at least every month-banging , scraping , brushing , rinsing what can be rinsed and then letting it all air dry ( if you do n't , hello moldy odor ! Been there too : ( ) , then put it all back together again . I was able to try this out via Amazon 's Vine program . I do not recommend this model . The repair shop person told me that Eureka has a lot of problems with the foot lever beater brush hold mechanism , but that they do stand behind their products and do warranty repairs-which is what I 'm having done . Boring drab red color , same color as my 5 year old Eureka Boss vacuum . On the box it looked plum colored-that would have been nicer .	-1
I am extremely disappointed by this product . I thought it was the answer to my prayers after spending months toiling with blenders and juicers just to try to get some fresh nutritious juice or smoothies every day . But this product seems to perform the same as the Tribest blender I bought , up to and including extremely leaky lids . Screw the blade on as tight as you can but it will still leak juice all over the place . I thought this product was going to blend everything so smoothly together into a very fine juice like concistency . But it is still just as gritty as what my blender does and after about 10 minutes you can see the juice and pulp separating in your cup . And yes , I used plenty of water and let it blend for about a minute . Perhaps I got a lemon , but I am extremely under impressed .	-1
I purchased the Nutri bullet after watching the late night infomercial . It looked like a faster , easier way to make juice than useing a regular juicer . It was easier to clean but overall it '' s very under-powered and proned to overheat very quickly . My Ninja blender does a better job and is much easier to store . I also question its long term reliability due to its cheap light plasticy build and motor that seems to strain itself with each use . The Ninja blender costs less as well .	-1
I gave my really expensive juicer away after purchasing the nurtibullet but now I am sorry I did ! ! This product DOES NOT juice , it makes a sluggish slurry mush ( which the consistancy is horrible to drink ) , and you have to fill half of the cup with water . I did make hummus and guacamole which came out ok but the consistancy of these foods are very thick so the food gets stuck underneath the blades and is hard to clean . I would say the nutribullet is good for is salsa and smoothies , & the book had a couple of good recipes in it . It does have a great mixing blade and is small for a serving of one . But I am definitely going back to the store and buying another juicer .	-1
This thing lastest a little over three months and the bearing on the extractor blade went out causing it to get so loud I had to plug my ears . Customer service is impossible to get ahold of . You call and if you get through they ask you to leave your phone number and they will call you back . Was never called back . Reading other reviews here it seems they make you pay shipping and handling for their defective parts and two week turn arounds . Basically you have no blender during this whole process . As for the smoothies themselves they are not all the great . I 'm sure a 30 dollar model from walmart could out perform this . If the thirty dollar walmart one broke in a short time you wo n't be as pissed as when this one breaks ! I 've been juicing and making smoothies for a couple years now . I 'm just going to try and forget about my hundred dollar loss here and go buy the last Blender I 'll ever buy . A Vitamix or Blentec . I wish Amazon would take this off it 's shelves and not work with such crappy companies . End of story .	-1
The containers are far too small to be useful , especially if you follow the fill line guidelines . The photos are misleading and though the product description mentions the ounce capacity , this is n't helpful information for fresh fruits and vegetables . After all the whole point of this device is to puree fresh foods into a drinkable liquid.Unless you are looking for a cup or so of product , all the containers are far too small . Even the largest one , is not enough to make a full size meal replacement drink . I was not impressed with the ability to puree fresh greens and fruit either . It DOES NOT do what the infomercial demonstrates . It absolutely leaves large chunks of matter in the cups . You are better off with a good quality full size blender . I returned it without an issue , so thanks to Amazon and the product reseller .	-1
I bought a nutri bullet in September 2012 . I did better with a blender which had more power and capacity . Due to credit card fraud , my credit card company changed my number . I promptly emailed and called customer service 35-40 times , carefully keeping track of the times and dates of my attempts . I repeatedly sent them my phone number to call me since I was unable to get a hold of me and this was an acceptable method per the site . I had one payment of $ 27 to complete and I just wanted to give them the new number . All I got was auto emails saying with the standard , `` I 'll get back to you '' which they never did . Finally I got a threatening email that they were going to send my account to collection for the $ 27 , though I had spent 4 weeks trying to give them the information and was not worried about my documentation as proof . It was the most unfriendly , incompetent customer service I have ever received in 60 years .	-1
I had been experimenting with juicing and combining them with smoothies for the fiber for a few weeks now . I wanted to save time by combining the two things . The nutri-bullet claims to save this step , and to liquify everything , but it does not chop the kale ... fine enough . It also does not grind up the blueberry and raspberry seeds . I ran it forever hoping to accomplish this , but it is just too dull . I recreated the very same smoothie in my blender and it at least smoothed out most of the kale ( but not the seeds ) . The kale was just undrinkable in the nutri-bullet ( even blended with berries ... . ) . I had to choke it down . I added liquid as instructed , but it just tasted awful . I will stick to either smoothies or the juicing combined with smoothies in my normal blender .	-1
First I will state up front that I returned this product before ever opening it , but I was able to `` test drive '' my sister 's bullet , so I feel okay sharing why I did n't keep the unit.1 . This product is not recommended for those who are interested in actually starting a juice fast or using juicing as a large part of their diet like in `` Fat , Sick , and Nearly Dead , '' `` The Gerson Miracle '' or `` Food Matters . '' More info about juicing and recommended equipment can be found on the Gerson Institute 's website -- a non-profit that has been treating cancer and other disease with juicing and nutrition since the 1930s.2 . The two small cups are pretty much useless . They can not be filled all the way or the unit will leak while blending , and they do n't hold much to begin with . The system only comes with one large cup , which also does n't hold enough produce to yield one adult-sized juice.3 . The stand portion of the base is plastic , silvertone to look like metal , and when leaks occur ( often ) , the liquid seeps into the crevices around that plastic and any other seams in the unit -- breeding bacteria and generally making a mess that is very hard to clean.4 . Overall , the unit is very overpriced for what it is . Three small plastic cups and a tiny , heat-producing motor in a plastic base . There are far better quality juicers and/or blenders ( if you 're more into smoothies ) out there in this price range . I ended up purchasing a Breville juicer , then returning that after reading that centrifugal juicers are also not recommended for nutritional juicing . I finally settled on a masticating juicer which is recommended for juicing and therapeutic nutrition , with better quality and far greater performance than the bullet or the Breville -- about $ 100 more than this item , but an investment that 's been well worth it.Lastly , when I returned this item , I lost $ 10 and some change , even though it was a Prime item at the time of my purchase . I started the return before I even received the item , after seeing my sister 's bullet ( which she placed in a yard sale ) . It was returned completely unopened , just changed the shipping labels on the cardboard box . My purchase price was $ 129.99 , and the item was Prime eligible , so no shipping . I was only issued a refund of $ 119.00 , and informed that the refund was minus shipping and handling ( but there was no shipping and handling ) . So I lost over $ 10 on a product I never even opened . I ca n't recall a single time I 've ever received a reduced refund on a Prime item , but apparently with this item you will pay shipping to return it even when you do n't pay any to receive it . I see that the item is now selling for $ 119.00 with `` free shipping '' ( not Prime ) , the same amount I was refunded , so it looks like when I purchased mine , they were just adding the $ 10 shipping into the purchase price and calling it a Prime item . Lesson learned on my part , but I did want to let others , especially Prime members , know to be certain they want this item before ordering , because you 'll pay for the privelege of changing your mind .	-1
UPDATE : Broke in 4 months . Only used 2-3 times a week . Motor gave out , started smoking and would not turn . My original review is below . I was right , first impression seemed like it was not going to last . The Oster I talked about below on the other hand looks like it is built to last . Probably a total loss , I do not care to have it replaced or pay for shipping . I can not give this more than 1 star , even though it was fine when it worked.Compared to a regular blender , this Nutribullet is definitely worth it . It does a really good job creating juice smoothies . It turns it smooth enough to enjoy drinking . I like that it uses the entire fruit , rather than wasting the pulp like a juicer does . They give you 2 small plastic jars and 1 larger plastic jar . I guess when the larger plastic jar breaks , you will end up with even less room in the smaller jars . Wish they included 2 large ones instead . The thread does not look like it fits any other common glass jars like a tomato jar.The unit looks sharp but the plastic gives it a sense that it will not last long . I also do not like that there is not switch . Pushing and turning to turn on seems cheap.Just before I got this , I tried blending grapefruit and oranges in a regular blender and it turned out a lumpy and it does seem like it is wasted , since you can not chew it and your body will likely not get all the nutrients from it . The Nutribullet does a nicer job and is definitely worth it just for this . Although I found an Oster BVCB07-Z Counterforms 6-Cup Glass Jar 7-Speed Blender , Brushed Stainless/Black . I bought it because it is bigger for making tomato sauce out of fresh tomatos . This Oster does just as good of a job , has greater capacity , lower price . I am keeping both , using the Nutribullet every day . If or when it breaks , I will not replace it . I will start using the Oster for everything.There you go . It is worth it , but there is one alternative that I found that is also good .	-1
I loved the NutriBullet when I got it , I used it every day . I purchased mine directly from their website . I even posted on my blog how awesome it was and recommended it to others . After having it about a month it sprung a leak , I had smoothie all over my counter and dripping down through the power base . I unplugged it and sent an email to customer service . I received no answer from them after three days so I tried to call them , after wading through a sea of voice prompts I finally received a message that said their customer service queue was full and to call back later - wow , no answer to email and they wo n't even take my calls.After about 5 days I received an email saying they 'd replace the unit and even waive shipping since it was less than a month old . Cool , that worked for me , problem solved ... or so I thought . When I replied back to thank them for the replacement I received another reply asking me a bunch of questions about what I was doing when it broke . Each time I replied to one of their emails it took at least two days to get a reply . They would ask me something and I 'd answer , then I 'd get a reply asking the same thing a different way . It was almost as if they were intentionally stalling to keep from replacing my NutriBullet . I tried calling again and this time the phone would ring twice and go to a fast busy signal , I tried several times over the course of a day and then emailed again . After a few more days of trying I was able to leave a voice mail and was told they 'd call me back . Finally I received a call saying they were sending my replacement out and they 'd just need a credit card to charge the shipping to even though I was told I would n't be charged for shipping ... since they stalled for two weeks now I was past my 30 days but eventually did get it shipped without paying.That was over 2 weeks ago and I was told I would receive my replacement in 7-10 days . It 's been over a month since I had the problem and first contacted them . I 've made half a dozen phone calls and traded a dozen emails with them and still do n't have a replacement.If you decide to get a NutriBullet just be aware that if it breaks and you do n't have a local retail store that will swap it out for you that you are in for one of the most frustrating experiences you 've ever had . I still do n't know when I 'll get my replacement and most definitely would n't recommend others to buy one . Stupid NutriBullet . **UPDATE : ** On 10/17/12 ... after 21 emails , 4 phone calls and 5 weeks I received my replacement . I 've used it a few times but to be honest after the ordeal to get it replaced I 'm a bit burnt out on it . I 'll definitely not purchase anything from this company again .	-1
This is a defective product . BUY AT OWN RISK ! Not even a month in , the microwave started smelling of burned components . Little did I know , it had a working short in progress . Two nights straight , when turned on , the house power went out . The third time , an electrician had to be called in on an emergency night call . The house 's main lug had been burned through . Cause was the microwave , as evidenced by the fact that one day after the electrician call , the cavity magnetron in this product arced after only a few seconds of operation.We 've had to have the lug replaced again due to the shorting load on the system.Even when the unit was running , you could hear a grinding noise coming from the oven . I was about to return the unit for that alone.I 'll NEVER get this product again .	-1
I have no idea how the actual microwave was or functioned . All I know is that the description said `` like new '' and that was not the case . The front end was smashed in making the button to open the door very hard to open , and the side you could see into the inside ( did n't seem very safe to me ! ) so I returned it for a refund . Glad I did because I 've read that several people say this brand breaks often and soon after purchasing.On an unrelated note , the return process was very very speedy , that I was impressed by . I submitted my return request online late Sunday night and they had someone out to pick it up Monday afternoon ! : )	-1
This item arrived at my place without working . No light , no sound , nothing . We tried every plug in the house , but nothing . I had to send it back . I did n't want to replace it ...	-1
I was thrilled when I opened the box for this set . On first look , it looked like a steal for the money . It was a medium weight set with fairly thick bottoms . I cooked a steak in the skillet -- no problem . The next day , I fixed bacon and found that the pieces on the edges cooked normally , but the center ones remained uncooked . The grease also ran from the center over to the sides . On closer look , I noticed that the center of the pan had a raised area or bump . The pan was not apparently warped out the outside and sat level , so it looks like the inside of the pan was coming loose from the encapsulated base . I did not cook above low temperature at any time ; I am experienced on stainless steel cooking . Another reviewer below had a similar experience , so I am afraid to continue using this set . Maybe it was just one bad pan , but I do n't want to take the chance .	-1
These were very poor quality.I returned them immediately returned them immediately . I would not recommend them to any one .	-1
I bought this set because of the handles on either side of the 4 stock pots . I have arthritis in my wrists , and being able to lift a pan with both hands is a real advantage . 7 months after this set was purchased I was boiling water for pasta in the large stock pot and heard a loud BANG . The bottom of the pot had a raised area the size of my hand . Each time the pot has been used after that , the same area has become more discolored . The change in the metal seems not to be only on the surface , as even Barkeeper 's Friend used with steel wool does n't clean it off . I 'm taking it to the recycling center , as it seems to me that this pot may no longer be safe to use . Would n't buy from this manufacturer again .	-1
... when you try to use the tongs or the jar lifter it takes two hands to manipulate the instrument . The rivets are so tight that they do not allow the pieces they join to move . I will try some WD40 on them but they way the work now these tools are an accident waiting to happen . **Considering these tools are designed to use on glass jars containing boiling liquids in the home kitchen around families they should be taken off the market.There is no manufacturer listed and no country of origin . ** I used WD40 and the rivets relaxed which makes the tools usable .	-1
I tried to save money by buying this instead of a Vitamix . Lesson learned . According to the description , the Ninja is supposed to be able to puree and even juice in addition to chop but all it seems able to do is chop . I tried different blades and different size containers and different settings but to no avail . This is a fine chopper if you do n't already have a Cuisinart but I would not recommend this for pureeing or juicing .	-1
I read the reviews , I saw the infomercials , I took the bait and bought the super product . Before the end of the year in absolute frustration about a machine that did not remotely live up to its hype I gave the thing away . Making cookie dough was a messy project that involved dry ingredients piling up in the corner and not mixing properly . I had to dump it out , mix it by hand , put it back in at which point it stalled the blades . I tried numerous times to make different types of dough always ended the same way , a huge mess and using a mixer instead.This is just the smaller bowl feature . The larger contraction took up for more space in my small kitchen than this appliance was actually worth.The fuses blew with this thing , the design was so chintzy that frequently I dumped the ingredients out and try to proceed by hand . It was hard to clean , the lid has a little pin that slides in place when you push everything down properly . The pin in one of the lids quit working properly within 2 months of purchase . I 'm fairly handy in the kitchen and with appliances . But unfortunately for a period of about 15 years I had the competing appliance that Ninja is supposed to replace for 400 dollars less . That was an appliance that did live up to its hype and I made everything from sorbet to ground flour , to peanut butter , to soup . It was a master at what it did , not so the Ninja , I suppose if I did n't have something that actually really worked well to compare it with I wound not have found the Ninja such a disappointment.I replaced this with an economical food processor that is far easier to clean up , far more efficient , far cheaper and far more versatile . This was one of my most regrettable appliance purchases	-1
I bought this Ninja system 4 months ago and already one pitcher is cracked badly and the company does not replace the pitchers . so sad . Gon na save up for a blendtec .	-1
I 've been eating rice , of all colors , for over 65 years and have owned countless cookers . I ca n't seem to get the right combination of water to rice . It 's either too hard or too soft . The closest I 've come is a 1 to 1.75 ratio for white which is much too difficult to employ for different amounts.Surprisingly , the stainless pot is much easier to clean then I thought . A soak for about ah hour gets all the stuck rice out . Too bad as I 'll probably give this away to the local Goodwill equivalent.The last cooker I had was a red $ 15 Rival that cooked to perfection . Only lasted 3 years .	-1
My old rice cooker worked for over 20 years . I decided to try this one to get away from teflon and other toxic coatings leeching into my food.The problem is this heats unevenly . Result : burnt rice on the bottom , super soggy mushy rice slop up on top . I had this same result with 1 cup of rice or 3 cups of rice.I 'd give it zero stars if I could . Worse - I do n't think there 's any way for me to return this because I did n't keep the packaging.Buyer Beware .	-1
it seems like this thermometer reacts to temperature change slowly . it also is not very stable standing up . lastly , i have no definitive proof about this but i 'm pretty sure that it does not read temperature accurately either . it reads that my oven is like 250 degrees F when i have it on 350 ... .there 's no way that my oven is that bad . i bake a lot and when i follow recipes , they turn out fine . i do n't think that would happen with an oven that is 100 degrees off but again , not 100 % sure about this !	-1
The low rating is not due to the quality of the item but only that it did not work for our situation . I bought it for a 6 inch twin mattress so needless to say there 's about an extra 6-8 inches that just annoyingly floats around loosely .	-1
Why does the Amazon description state `` Made in USA '' , when on the sheets it says `` Made in China '' on the tag ? This seems to be false advertising . I will ask Amazon to look into this.EDIT : It appears Amazon removed `` Made in USA '' in the description . Well I was cheated , but at least you now know where it is really made .	-1
Coming from using a Keurig and tired of the bland sometimes `` meh '' watery coffee it produced , I was excited to try out a CBTL Americano . Unfortunately , Senseo , the manufacturer just did n't put enough thought into the machine . In 4 months I went through 2 machines and both had basically the same flaws . Senseo at the time did not have replacement machines in stock so both times I had to cut the cord off of a repairable machine and send it to them for a refund while throwing a lot of machine in the trash . WOW ! Terrible for the environment . Both machines suffered from either power issues or clogging issues or both . The first unit would not brew after tend days of use . I purchased over 100 capsules for it and was n't going to be left with all the unused coffee so I called Senseo who gave me the above instructions and hoped I would purchase another . I did , since I did n't want to waste over $ 75 in capsules . The second machine was good for about a month and then started clogging ... I had to run two capsules just to get a full cup and then it would have remnants of grounds in the cup . Not happy . Called Senseo again who instructed me to again , cut the cord off , peel the sticker from the bottom and they would refund me . At this point I quit , called the retailer where I bought the capsules and ended up returning the unused portions . Great idea , very poor execution .	-1
My machine works well so far , but my coffee/espresso tastes bitter . Worst tasting coffee ever . I would say that I could of just gotten a bitter box of capsules but to say that about all 6 boxes ?	-1
The sheets are being returned . They are n't bad except they 're really cheap and paper-thin . They were soft but you could see the mattress underneath because of how thin they were . We did n't like them at all .	-1
The sheets felt wonderful to the touch and the color was lovely , but I ended up tossing them out because of what seemed to be a persistent 'body odor scent ' that was on them right out of the package . That may not be the case for all sheets in this line , but it bothered me enough that I ended up just throwing them out .	-1
Like others who reviewed this set , I washed the sheets and pillow cases prior to putting them on the bed . I washed them in a gentle , cold wash. As I started to fold the pillow cases I noticed the stitching on half the open ends had either unraveled or there was no stitching . I purchased 400 count Egyptian cotton sheets from Malouf 2 months ago but the price had gone up $ 30.00 and I was reluctant to pay $ 109.99 . Since I liked the first set I figured I 'd try the microfiber set . I am sending the sheets back .	-1
I 'll post some pics of a weaving flaw that goes across the entire width of a twin XL sheet set I ordered . There are about 4 weaving flaws in the one place . The fabric should have been discarded and never made into a sheet . This set was purchased for short term use on a hospice hospital bed so once used , they will be thrown away or used to make an inner liner for a dog bed . They are not worth anything else.The fabric could hardly be described as `` brushed '' . It 's just thin poly that is suitable for making a blouse or light weight night gown ... .certainly not for sheets ! I was surprised at the amount of fine texture lint that came out of the dryer screen the first time they were washed . I 've never known poly to have so much lint upon laundering ! In case anyone is interested , the pocket on the twin XL sheet is exactly 14 inches deep from the edge of the all around elastic to the end of the pocket . I did not see any sewing flaws but I saw every color thread made in the form of lint all over these sheets . Little pieces of threads of every color.The pillow case says it 's a queen size.The maker spent far more on the over packaging of this product and the expensive looking woven labels on the sheets than they spent on the product itself . I can just see landfills of these hard square cardboard boxes ... ..W-A-Y over packaged for what the product actually is with regard to quality ! ! ! ! ( you can put a pig 's ear in a silk purse but it 's still a pig 's ear inside ... . ) No , I would not recommend this sheet set and no , I wo n't order another set .	-1
These sheets are awful.I bought a twin sheet set to see what they were like before I bought five more sets.I unpacked the sheets to find the fabric had several snags in the material as well as RED WRITING in permanent marker on the fabric as if they were & # 34 ; second & # 34 ; quality . I wasted my money and will never order this brand again .	-1
I 'm puzzled by the glowing reviews of this item . Returning mine today.The `` lid '' is just a floppy piece of flexible plastic that lays , not seals , on top . When you pour out the excess water that will accumulate in the moat around the outside of the tray , some of the cube openings empty with it . The tray is inflexible and will not twist or allow you to push from below to pup out the cubes . The cubes are small and actually stick to the surface of the tray , so even when you do manages to get them out , each cube leave some behind in the tray . I worked far harder removing the ice from this tray than my old fashioned ( and much less expensive ) trays .	-1
I should have known better . And I would have returned it but for the hundreds of excuses I managed to concoct to keep me from wrapping the item up and taking it to the post office . Do n't waste your money on this useless product .	-1
I really prefer to use oven mitts instead of the square hot pads to take stuff out of the oven . These looked nice when they showed up , but after one wash the seam split on the side . They 're still useable , but I would n't recommend these since they 're low quality .	-1
The thumb hole is too close to the nose and one can not gripe the hot item . Also the mitt is poorly insulated	-1
First let me say I absolutely love Oxo products . Generally they are very smartly engineered . And this is a great idea , especially with the `` fold down and store with the books '' functionality . However , I really do n't know what the acrylic piece is for . I do n't understand why they would make this cookbook holder , but make the acrylic piece so small that it wo n't really cover the pages of any but the smallest cookbooks , and I 'm talking about those that are the size of the spiral-bound church ladies-circle fundraising cookbooks.How many cookbooks do you pick up and can immediately determine which recipes are the most used ? How do you tell ? The splatters . The fingerprints . The smudges of chocolate/meat juices/sauces . That 's great for family history and all , but I 'd like keep the pristine pages of `` Mastering the Art of French Cooking '' pristine . So the piece is n't there to protect the pages of the book from my tendency to prematurely raise the beaters of the mixer , and additionally it creates a visual break in the text all around the edges so you have to move the book to read the text under the edge , usually using messy fingers . It would be much more useful if the piece had either been large enough to cover the cookbook , or small enough to hold the pages down yet not get in the way of the text ( like so many other cookbook holders ) .All this may have been anticipated by Oxo , and perhaps you just want it to read your iPad without touching the screen . I 'm reviewing this so that if you want more functionality , you do n't waste the $ 6 on the return like I did .	-1
Some things there is no need to exist.Here , OXO invented two kinds & # 8211 ; TWO KINDS & # 8211 ; of napkin holders.They take up a lot of space and are overdesigned pieces of steel and plastic.Just get a largish river stone or rock to keep napkins down . Really .	-1
I was looking forward to trying this product . It looked cool in it 's colors and styling and I liked how it was supposed to dispense one napkin at a time . Well , it looks good and does dispense one napkin at a time , but that is the end of the positive features . It would only hold 16 regular napkins . That means that for my family of four the napkin holder needed to be refilled after every fourth meal , or sooner . So I would be refilling the holder every other day . We did n't even bother refilling it , just went back to your old regular style holder which holds about 50 napkins !	-1
I really love most OXO products . My kitchen is filled with them . However , this is a rare example of what I think is a miss on their part . It basically looks like a very small muffin tin with a weighed bar in the middle . You put the napkins under the bar , and then pull them out as needed . The problem is that the napkins do n't really fit in there in any neat looking way . They look kind of like random napkins stuck anyplace just to have one when you need one -- -which is n't bad , really , but it 's not the kind of classy and useful design I expect from this company . The napkins are fairly easy to pull out once put in , and they do seem to come out one at a time , so it 's not a total failure , but I ca n't see using this much . It would n't be fancy enough for company , and for us just around the house , it does n't add much convenience over just having the napkins sitting around in their original packaging to grab as needed !	-1
I have been very curious about these silicone whisks for a long time . I have a flat metal whisk that I use the majority of the time and a basic black plastic whisk that I use in emergencies and ca n't find my other one . My complaint about that whisk has always been its inability to get into the edges of the pan when I 'm making gravy . But , this balloon whisk is a big improvement over that one . ( but I still do n't like it ) The silicone of this whisk took me a little getting used to . I splattered myself once as I was making gravy this morning because the silicone bounced back after being pressed on . So , I was a little more careful after that about experimenting with the best way to hold it and put pressure on it . I was afraid at one point that my gravy was going to be very lumpy , but then the whisk made big improvements in it . When I served the gravy , it seemed to be completely smooth , but on closer examination there were lumps in it . I 've been making gravy for twelve years now and my family always comments on my smooth gravy -- so I do know the tricks to getting a smooth gravy and how to use a whisk . The silicone held up well to use while the stove was on . It was able to get into the edge of the pan ( unlike my other balloon whisk ) . The handle is also very easy to hold and did n't get hot at all while I was working over the stove.As for the style of this whisk , if you do n't have a flat metal whisk -- get one ! They 're awesome ! The downside to them is that they ca n't be used with nonstick pans ( and this one can ) . I make my gravy in a cast iron pan , which you ca n't use on smooth top electric stoves . So , if you 're limited to nonstick pans , then this whisk is a good option.But , what I 'd really recommend is get stainless pans instead . Cuisinart 's chef classic stainless pans are wonderful and I do n't have to worry anymore about scratching off the nonstick surface . I used this whisk again and it really frustrated me . I had to put a lot of pressure on it to get it to work right and my wrist got very tired . I had to switch back to my flat wire whisk and my roux was smooth in no time.So , basically , I 'd pass on this whisk -- both this specific one and this type .	-1
I purchased this whisk because our last silicone whisk had worn down and the metal was prominently showing through the silicone covering - a problem since we use non-stick cookware.Within 2 weeks of using this whisk , I could already hear the sound of the metal on our non-stick cookware . Not impressed . Save your money .	-1
Most of the other reviews were positive about this whisk , but the one that I got is flimsy and not very effective . I have not had any silicone products for the kitchen , so thought I would give this a try . It could not handle mixing up the ingredients for pumpkin pie , so I had to get out a metal whisk . Tried again with batter for french toast , which is pretty liquid , and the whisk still separated apart . Since I do n't have non-stick pans , it really does n't matter , but this thing is going in the donate box .	-1
This little unit got mostly GLOWING reviews by my fellow Amazon buyers . I have to respectfully disagree with all the great reviews . WHY ? The picture shows a THICK , FLUFFY waffle and this machine does NOT make a waffle that is thick at all PLUS it takes a long time to cook the waffle . Yes , I have been making waffles for years and I do know how it 's done and no , it 's NOT my mix either ... ..it 's the machine . Although the waffles are ok ... ..they are only OK and if you are looking for a `` true '' Belgian Waffle maker ... ..skip this one .	-1
Highly disappointed . Not much else to say : - ( First use , and did n't even finish cooking the first waffle . Hopefully they will replace it .	-1
The very first container I took out of the package to wash for use , cracked as I was washing it . I am not heavy handed . I squeezed it slightly and there was the crack . Would not purchase these again .	-1
The velcro on these bags is too strong for the material . I nearly ripped a bag apart just trying to undo the velcro which holds them nicely folded .	-1
Well as excited as I was to order it , I guess I was n't meant to be warm this winter . ( cold spell is almost over ) When the heater arrived , the box was badly mangled that I could n't even get the heater out . It was in so many pieces ... a lot of it plastic . I decided then and there to return and not try for another . It just did not look too sturdy . The buyer was great about the return.It arrived and went out the VERY same day . I went ahead an order another stationary dish that my mother has had for years , and GUESS what ? ? having issues with FedEx because they claim they delivered to my front door ( and they did not ) . Its been 4 weeks of some of the coldest weather ... and space heater for me . If this one does n't come ( they are reshipping ) I am just gon na call it a season ... . ugh !	-1
I first thought this steamer was really cleaning my floor but now I know it was n't . I always vacuum very well first and I have 6 pads and I change them after every room so that way I wo n't be spreading dirt . I also spray the bottom of the moistened pad with a good cleaner that wo n't streak tile like Top Job basin tub & tile . I NEVER put cleaner in the tank just distilled water.OK , so I did my tile floors went back and did the kitchen a second time with another clean pad and all the traffic areas a second time too . Well , it must be clean right ? One would assume so but after the floor dried I thought I would just spray one tile with the same cleaner Top Job and see if a white towel test would be clean after wiping one single 13 '' tile . To my complete surprise the towel was really really dirty from just one tile ! Now , this was the same area I actually did twice with two different clean pads . My tile is fairly smooth Italian ceramic tile and terra cotta in color so it hides dirt well and it looked clean but it clearly was not . I vacuum daily and I steam clean my entire floor at least once a week usually twice . I do n't have kids or pets and we take our shoes off at the door yet why was my floor still so dirty after using this steam mop ? I am really upset at how filthy my floor was after using this . I have been using it for many months now assuming my floors were clean , I wish I thought of doing the white towel test right away I would have returned this . I did another area of 6 tiles with Top Job and another white towel and to my horror the towel was actually twice as dirty as the steam cleaner pad after one whole room , I mean it was BLACK ! This steam mop does NOT clean your floor it just shoots steam to make you think it 's clean . I am surprised and shocked because I was so sure my floors were deep clean but a white towel test simply does n't lie and this product does not clean your floors period .	-1
No invoice , no manual , no parts list and no warranty in the box.Ca n't find a manufacturer 's name or model number on it , so I do n't know how I could search the web for a manual or parts list.Comes without rubber feet ( which I knew when I bought it ; I ordered those separately ) . Without feet , I do n't see how it could be used without permanently mounting it with bolts.I have n't used it yet , because it comes partly disassembled and I have to find a pair of snap ring pliers to put it together . Snap ring pliers are n't found in your average homeowner 's kitchen drawer .	-1
The lids are not a snug fit and the large it too large . I have used the small and med . a few times but the handle gets in the way of stacking . Space is limited in my fridge , not a product that works at all for me .	-1
So my 20 years old Panasonic/Fussy logic is on its last leg , still working mind you but it looks sad and worn , so I was wondering whether I should spend another $ 100- $ 200 and decided to give this $ 39 a try . 1-month verdict : U get what you paid for . My Panasonic was perfect every time . This Aroma , if I use too little/too much water , it shows . The rice does n't taste like cooked evenly . At times there is even a spot that comes out watery . But I love the Aroma 's controls and display and luv that stainless steel , too bad it 's all looks and little performance .	-1
You would think a rice cooker is a rice cooker , but this one make a mess is hard to clean and takes forever to cook anything .	-1
I accidentally ordered this product in a flurry of rice cooker research , thought it was stainless steel , it IS NOT . Promptly exchanged it ( at my cost ) for the & # 34 ; Aroma ARC-753SG 3-Cup ( Uncooked ) 6-Cup ( Cooked ) Simply Stainless Rice Cooker & # 34 ; which is great so far ! Cooking/Steaming/Heating in materials not made of stainless steel is a really bad idea IMO , making this product useless .	-1
I hate this rice cooker . It takes a long time to cook the rice . There 's a time display but it does n't count down until it reaches the 12 minutes left mark . It leaks starchy rice water all over the place . My cheaper Rival cooker worked better .	-1
I purchased this item because it consistently got great reviews . Unfortunately in my kitchen I did n't see a great product . We used this twice and both times the rice was inedible . Sticky , overcooked , and clumped rice with the bottom layer burnt . I question that it was defective since so many other people have such great reviews . This is heading back to Amazon for a refund .	-1
I suppose I missed this in reading up on the product , but the top is not removable . It is hinged on , which is ridiculous since the top invariably is splattered with rice . Very difficult maintenance , do n't recommend at all .	-1
I bought this one due to all the good reviews . My first disappointment was the brown rice cycle took 75 minutes . When I tried to cook brown rice , at the end of the cycle it was not cooked so I added more water and started again , and it still was n't cooked so I started again . By then it was over cooked and mushy . I gave it another try and the same thing happened . I decided I can cook my rice on the stove for less time and it comes out much better.Not sure why but this thing did n't work for me .	-1
Quite simply , they 're a lot smaller than they need to be . The jaws do n't open wide enough to get anything into them to chop . And when you do manage to get something to chop , lots of & # 34 ; bits & # 34 ; get stuck between the dual blades . Another product I was stoked about , until I actually got it ...	-1
Lettuce gets caught between the dual blades . It also would not chop leafy greens that were not crisp . My dollar store kitchen scissors work better , are easier to clean and are , well , a dollar ...	-1
I loved these scissors when I first received them , but they fell apart and the screw will not stay in place for me . I have given three pairs to friends for gifts , and I hope theirs do not fall apart too ! ! ! Using scissors for chopped salads is a great tool , guess I will find another company .	-1
Simply does not work as advertised , Very frustrating . Better off to keep cutting your Pineapplesthe old fashioned way as this will just drive you nuts and waste your time .	-1
It gets the core out but it is very messy . So now i just use a knife to slice my pineapple .	-1
This was WAY too large for a kitchen aid cover . Made it look sloppy . However if you nave a nuwave oven it fits that well enough although still a little large .	-1
Novel , but not that needed . Requires lots of pumps to get anything going . It 's easier to just squeeze the lemon - worked for chefs for centuries just fine .	-1
I have n't had these very long and at first thought they would be fine . They have already dulled and I make sure not to wash these in dishwasher . This makes me sad because I just threw away my money	-1
These are thin & cheaply made ( in China ) . The ones @ Bed Bath & Beyond ( also made in China ) are thicker & last longer . I 'm considering just using tennis balls but I 'm worried that they might stain my laundry .	-1
I just got these in and am very disappointed in the color . It is a very grayish blue , not the brighter blue . They are n't even a denim blue . The only reason that I 'm keeping them is because they do match another set of dishcloths that I just received and are also not the color that I was hoping for . Buyer beware if you 're looking for a brighter blue .	-1
I used the first towel before washing and within a few days the entire seam down one side came off in the water . I am just now using another in the set . I will update once I see how it holds up .	-1
I purchased this table cloth about 2 months ago . I agree that the colors are nice . However , it started fading after only one month of use . It 's like the color is being wiped away a little at a time . I only used a wet cloth to wipe it down . So , there is no reason for it to fade so quickly.I like that it has a soft cotton-like backing , but the top is not as durable as I had hoped . It has small holes in it already from normal use.I would only recommend this if you plan to have a cover on top of this table cloth . If you only want it for looks and rarely use the table , it might last quite a while . If you are looking for something to look nice and protect your table from normal usage , I would look elsewhere .	-1
I got this pillow in the midst of my pillow buying frenzy to find the perfect one to match my Dreamfoam mattress I just bought . This one was way too lumpy for my tastes . I like smooth sleeping surfaces . It was soft , I guess .	-1
I tried this pillow based on the reviews and have honestly tried to like it over the last several months . Unfortunately for me the shredded filling just does not work . I find a solid foam to be much more comfortable for my needs . I am constantly readjusting it all night long . As other have stated that purchased the pillow in February , it just does not seem to have an sufficient amount of filling in the first place and the fact that it is shredded of course gives it the ability to bunch up on one side or the other ... I should have known that just from a practical standpoint .	-1
I have two other of these air purifiers ( a different more expensive brand ) and thought that I would try this brand because it was cheaper . It is very quiet ( quieter than the other brand ) but it never produced that & # 34 ; fresh & # 34 ; ion air smell . I bought it in November and it died within a few months . Verrrry disappointing . I put the unit aside and planned on contacting customer support but I forgot . I 'm still going to try to contact them bc the unit is n't even 6 months old .	-1
Giftee says it does nothing . Runs 24/7 and she cant tell that it does anything in her 12x12 bedroom . I read some reviews of the same complaints . I suppose some of us just get bad ones . I 'd say buy at your own risk . I have the expnsive one in my cart , probably try that one.I did get one of the cigarette light plug in ones and that was my first experiance with these things . It works great . Must just be a dud .	-1
The hook is smaller than all my other hangers and too small for my rail . I gave them to a friend to try and pass on.The wood could use a light sanding . I guess IKEA has a Northern European idea about closet poles .	-1
It 's noisy and takes longer than my & # 34 ; manual & # 34 ; opener . Also , if it 's not Exactly perpendicular when you extract the cork from the bottle , it 's really difficult to remove the cork from the opener .	-1
it was sent as a gift , i think i sent a note to the seller . if it was n't for the fact the person threw away the box , i would have told her bring it to me and i will return , she said with the new corks it just does not work well .	-1
I was disappointed with this product , maybe I expected too much . It is large & cumbersome to use and is not very fast . The stand and appearance is very nice , but it was n't worth the money.Update : As of today 6/13 it does n't work at all and I 'm using my old opener ; really wish I could get a refund . Total waste of money !	-1
Be aware that you 'll HAVE to use the screws to mount this to the wall . The tape they provide just is n't enough to hold it up when it 's full of the empty plastic bags . Kept falling off wall in middle of the night . And way too late to return it darn it !	-1
There are two primary problems to this device . The first was putting bags into it . The second was getting bags out of it . The third was how many time it fell off the cabinet door . The fourth was how many times it fell out of the cupboard and landed on my toes after I gave up attaching it back to the door . You can think of these as two problems or four . Using it and storing it are the primary problems.Almost every single time I tried to put bags in the top of the thing , they jammed . Same with putting them in the side vent . My hands are very small so while I could struggle with getting them out ( while scratching my hands ) , my husband could n't reach in it at all . When I took bags out they invariably tore . I kept the device only because it worked every blue moon and that still improved on the loose bags under the sink.The connection ? Worthless . It fell off the inside of the cupboard door , constantly . When I finally gave up and just put it under the sink , it fell out on my toes -- exactly one too many times . And THAT was how it ended up in the trash can .	-1
Loved it until it fell off ... I put it up using the 3m stickers it came with . It should 've came with more stickers.. Now I have to drill the wall to keep this on , which I hate doing..	-1
Greetings fellow amazonians I picked this up because I 've been part of the carnival for a while and wanted to show my appreciation for the guys here by throwing a little party . So I went to the store and went looking for some meat unfortunatly on my budget I could afford some of the better cuts . Instead I opted for something that the butcher said may help me out . He broght out this huge box of frozen pink stuff . He said it was the pink slime that they used to put into hamburger , but since no one wants it anymore he said I could have it . I thought this was great , but he did say `` please mix this with some other meat ; we do n't know what would happen if you eat it alone '' . It may have been good advice , but i am on a budget and need to feed 50 hungry carnnies . Anyhoo I took my prized catch home with me and started to defrost it . I fired up the stove and broke out my new 10 cookware set . I decided I was going to make some hamburgers , meatloaf and something new I invented called `` slime surprise '' . The party started about an hour later and some of the pig iron men were the first to show up , then the barkers were next finally the freaks were last ( they are such prima donnas ) . Eugene was in charge of the music and entertainment and mongo was the host riding around on his rascal with hors d'erves and drinks . Everybody was having a great time the alligator man was breakdancing , the blockhead was hammering nails in his ears and even the worlds fattest man got up and danced with his woman , the bearded lady . Everything was going swimmingly and then it was time to eat . Everybody dug in and even mongo seemed to like my cooking . Then someone said the hamburgers tasted a little off . I picked one up and noticed it smelled a little like someone had peed on it . I took a bite anyway and wow this stuff was awful . It was like someone peed on a hockey puck and slapped it in a bun . Then I tried the meatloaf , while better , still had the consistancy of used cat litter . Finally , I tried the slime surprise and it was by far the worse the cheese and noodles that i added must have intensified the flavors of the slime and did n't cover them up . I noticed that everybody was lookong at me and finally one of the barkers stood up and said `` hey what kind of meat is this anyway '' not thinking I just said `` slime '' . Boy that did n't go over well at all . The pig iron men started to take my trailer apart piece by piece , the barkers started spray painted what was left with all of these obscenities and the freaks held me down while a blockhead shoved a 3 inch nail up my nose . Finally afterall that they left . When I came back to my senses eugene was busy playing world of warcraft on the computer ( it was the one thing that was n't broken or spray painted ) and mongo was busy eatting the last of the slime surprise ( he also ate the rest of the meatloaf and hamburgers while I was out ) . So much for trying to make friends around here	-1
I was very disappointed with the quality of T-Fal . The non-stick coating started peeling almost immediately . The whole set seemed cheap and flimsy .	-1
So , less than a year after we bought these skillets , the handle has fallen off of the large one . Last night I made Peppersteak for dinner . We had a guest over and it was almost 8:00 by the time I was done cooking , which is late by our standards . I went to pick up the skillet from the stove to serve dinner and the handle snapped in half dumping dinner all over our floor . Ended up with fast food take-out.The metal portion of the handle only extends a short way into the plastic and the plastic gets brittle with time . That 's a bad combination.These would be okay if you wanted a set for a dorm or short-term apartment , or possibly if you do n't cook often . I ca n't recommend them if you plan to actually use them more than a couple times a week .	-1
This is such a pretty little pan , I hate to give it a bad review but there 's some big problems for a tiny pan ! First of all , completely disregard the measurements in the description ( 10.9 x 5.4 x 0.8 inches ) , I do n't know what they 're talking about but they are n't accurate in any direction . Tip of handle to opposite side of pan is 9.5 & # 34 ; , top to bottom of pan body is 2.5 & # 34 ; tall and width of pan body is 4.25 & # 34 ; , or 4.5 & # 34 ; from spout to spout . So it 's very small , be aware . That is n't even my main complaint however , I knew the dimensions could n't be correct but I still knew it was very small so that was fine.I took it out of the box , admired how cute and bright it is and also how sturdy it felt . I then brought it to my kitchen stove ( smooth-top ) and set it on the burner to see how it looked . It immediately tipped over toward it 's handle . I put it back up and it stayed but wobbled , I set it back down again and it tipped over . The handle is too heavy and so the entire pan is off balance . Even in an upright position I can see the side with the handle touches the stove top while the opposite side is actually not even touching the surface because of the weight pulling the other side down . So that alone makes this pan dangerous to cook with . I was planning to use it to reheat hot drinks like coffee and cocoa or to melt butter with , since I do n't have a microwave . The picture shows soup . Any one of these hot liquids spilled would scald the hand and it tips over in the direction of the heavy handle , right where your hand would be ! I ca n't tell you how many times I touched it , lightly , tapped it , etc. , to make sure it was as horribly tippy as it seemed because I wanted so badly to use it , but it tips over at least half the time or more . In theory I could assume it would stay upright once it 's weighted down with something in it , but at what level does that change if I pour some out and return it to the burner , etc . It 's just too dangerous.Additionally , there was some sort of & # 34 ; something & # 34 ; on the surface of the interior . It looked like rust , it was red/rust in color . Hoping it was just something from being manufactured I washed it thoroughly by hand . Still there . I could wipe a paper towel and see the rust color but could n't wash it out . The second hand wash I used more pressure with my sponge . Rinsed , dried and checked : The color disappeared but now there 's circular scrub marks on the bottom from my sponge ! NOT a scrubbie sponge , no abrasive whatsoever , just a regular sponge and a firm hand . So whatever coating they used is soft , which I find troublesome . If I can mar it with a normal sponge would some come off in my food when I stir it with a spoon ? I do n't want to find out.Finally , there is some corrosion on the portion of the handle that meets the pan , but that 's almost a moot point after the above problems . It 's such a shame because it 's so cute . Maybe the coating is defective , but I am amazed that the other reviews do n't mention how tippy this is . Anyway , I 'm disabled and home bound , so getting out to return this is more effort than it 's worth , but I definitely will not be cooking with it . Maybe I can hang it for decoration or use it as a bird seed scoop or something . Too bad.I do not recommend this at all .	-1
the picture on the page seemed to be larger than actual size of the pan . This was my first mistake in using Amazon . Very disappoint ! but keep the pan as a warning to be careful the next time . Hope to get enjoyment to get my money worth of this blunder . but good for one egg or small item to be heated or cook . price was high for the size . like a children play pan and not for a adult . I am hard on this review so others do not fall into this trap . It was a shock when I opened the box to see this pan . otherwise I will find ways to use this pan that is smaller than expected . And no lid with the pan .	-1
Thought it would be wider and less deep . It shows an egg cooking , but there would be no way to get a utensil in it to flip . Disappointed . Hard to use on an electric burner .	-1
I bought this microwave in hopes my father who is blind could use it . It might work well for some people , but I guess he is too old to adjust to it . When I first got it , it made a whining , groaning noise as the turntable went around . It was very loud and really bothered us . I tried oiling it with WD40 , but that did n't help . At least not right away . Eventually the noise got better or we just got used to it , not sure which right now . It seems to be very powerful , but it 's hard to control the time . Also , it does n't have any settings , like for popcorn , so you have to stand there and wait for it to finish popping . It 's very heavy and slides around on our tile counter . I 'd replace it with a digital one , but it works , so for now I 'll keep it . I discovered later that this brand is sold at WalMart . Go figure .	-1
The coating on the hanger is very rough like sand paper and I was worried it would scratch my metal jewelry . I returned it and bought one with a rubbery coating instead .	-1
carbon filter does not control/remove slight odors much less more serious odors . the ozone smells nice a while but the same odor comes back in a couple of hours . I do n't think the light works on virus/mold either ; at least it has n't for me . I primarily bought this for the ozone feature that does n't work so I run the machine without ozone constantly on highest setting and it does absolutely nothing in a small closed off room much less a regular size room ! If that feature had worked , I would have considered it a good investment . my ionic breeze and Oreck machines work in this room but not this 6 stage machine . so I have concluded this item is a piece of crap , full of false advertisement , and definitely a waste of money . Not worth it !	-1
We have to keep it on low because it is sooo loud at higher speeds . I have had it for a while and I 'm not convinced it works very well . I run it 24/7 and see very little on the filter . The ozone generator does leave a & # 34 ; fresh & # 34 ; sent in the air , but you must leave the room while it 's running and leave windows open and the fans running , which means the fresh sent dissipates quickly . I would NOT buy again , I was much happier with the quiet operation of the sharper image ionic breeze with GP . You can actually see the dirt the ionizer picks up in the air after a few days . ( however I do n't think they make them anymore though ) I also noticed since my purchase this product is marketed under many different names , the cabinet may be different but it certainly appears to be the same item . I do not recommend this item , in the future I will stick with the name brands .	-1
These bowls are too small to use for anything . They are even too small for my cats . About the size of the palm of someones hand .	-1
I bought it because I have other Stainless Steel products , from simplehuman , and they are terrific ! This unit is not heavy enough ! Unless you have the perforations of the paper towel lined up , just after the tension arm , it will not tear correctly , or pull the entire unit off the countertop ! I only use Bounty , so maybe it would work better with another brand !	-1
The buttons ARE hard to push . I thought people complain because they keep holding it for more than the suggested 30 seconds - of course the fingers get tired . But no , I actually have to try 3-4 times until I push the button the right way so the blender eventually turns on , and my finger hurts after just a few seconds . Sometimes I find it just right , and then I 'm able to finish the job with just a little discomfort . But that 's not typical . Typical is the frustration and the pain . And I 'm just an average strength woman , no hand problems or such.Cleaning is very easy . The key is : immediately . I do n't even put down the machine , right after I 'm finished I take off the head and shake it in a bowl of water . Then rinse and that 's it . 5 seconds . Do n't let stuff dry on.Bottom line : The idea of a hand blender is great , I 'm glad I own one . In certain situations it saves the day . But I 'm not glad I own THIS one . If you still have a chance , get a different one.Update : After six months of struggle I found the Cuisinart HB-155PC for only $ 10 more . Now I 'm happy . Donated the Chefman and changed my rating from 3 to 2 stars . I do not recommend this product , and I highly recommend the Cuisinart HB-155PC instead .	-1
The too-short handle with the button you have to hold on top makes this mug difficult to drink from when it 's full of liquid . The weight of the liquid shifts , making it awkward to hold.The tight wrapper almost causes you to damage the finish to get it off.Someone recommended this for the Bunn MCU single-serve coffee maker . It does NOT fit at all easily in that machine.The color is pretty , and the coffee stayed reasonably warm . It did n't leak.The instructions for filling are inside the mug , so you have to figure out how to remove the lid to get at the instructions for removing the lid . The info on the wrapper is wrong.I 'm annoyed at having to buy another mug after one use of this thing .	-1
I have used this style of corkscrew in years gone by and believe that I know a good one when I see it . This is not that corkscrew . It seems to be well designed , however , when the 2 part chromed portion of the device is folded out into the & # 34 ; tee & # 34 ; shape , it fails in its purpose . It does not allow the application of leverage and using it makes me weep . Truly , I do n't like this , and the cost of it promises performance and it just ai n't there . Looks as though it should be a quality item , but save your money and get one where the fold out chromed portion is one piece , not two.Why a two , not one star rating ? Well , it does pull the cork , just not well at all .	-1
The item pictured is an authentic Dyson product . I ordered expecting a Dyson filter . I received a generic filter instead . This generic filter was sold by Allergy Be Gone - Amazon Marketplace .	-1
The Hamilton Beach Flexbrew will not put a hole in the top of the cup and leaving it off is not an option . May as well brew coffee with loose grounds like was designed .	-1
Grinds get in coffee and inside area where next container of coffee goes to make a fresh cup of coffee , have wasted more money trying all these different makes , to me the best ones are the original ones to use with this pot.Would have been nice to have our well liked brand of coffee if these would have worked , also tried hot chocolate , disaster .	-1
Maybe I did n't read the instructions on the product information , but I have not used this product at all so far because the containers are wayyyyyy too small ... the quality is good ( reason for my 2 stars ) but really useless becaz of size	-1
This is a very small coffee maker , it is described as holding 5 cups maybe they are talking about the demi cups but certainly not a standard American coffee cup . It holds about 26oz that would have given me 2 cups of coffee . Not what I was expecting .	-1
I got this because the reviews were pretty fair . I do not know of i got crappy one or not . The blend seems to constantly get stuck and dtop working after 10 seconds of crushing of latte chips . It is very loud . I wish my kids had not destroyed the box 5 seconds after I got this because I would have returned it .	-1
Plus 1 star for the glass jar , Plus 1 star for the overall look from afar.Minus 1star for the noise . Minus 2 stars for the button controls that are wobbly and unevenly placed.Had to return the item.Too bad , because I really like the width of the jar.Not sure if the issue on button controls applies to all its stocks , but we 'll not get a replacement as we do n't want to take the risk .	-1
Itchy , hot and flimsy ! Should have known better , it 's POLYESTER , for Pete 's sake ! What did I expect from a fabric that starts as crude oil . [ ... ] Spent an unbearable hour with them , then spent the rest of the night on top of my 100 % cotton bedspread.I will use the pillow cases for storage , the flat sheet ( which was way too narrow for the bed , anyway ) will become either a shower curtain or a picnic table cover . The fitted sheet will get cut up to make tote backs for my groceries . Of course , if I did n't re-purpose the set , it could just as easily be recycled to make plastic bottles or lawn chairs.Two stars for fast , free delivery .	-1
We 've purchased a lot of humidifiers over the years . Things likeCrane Adorable Ultrasonic Cool Mist Humidifier with 2.1 Gallon Output per Day - Penguinwhich looks cute and worked well , but barely lasted a year . We 've also purchased things like theOptimus U-31005 2.0 Gallon Cool Mist Ultrasonic Humidifierwhich worked too well as we 'd wake up to a foggy room and the piece grew algae amazingly quickly and was extremely hard to clean . So now my family is on the Vornado Evap 3 Whole Room Humidifier . It works decently , as you can feel the room 's humidity increasing without seeing copious amounts of mist , but that 's about the only positive thing I can say about it.For one thing , the machine is the loudest humidifier I 've ever had . It was hard to get used to at first . Usually humidifiers are quiet with only a hum and the occasional bubbling of water for noise . Not this . It is very loud and because of that , you probably do not want this machine in your bedroom as it will keep you up . Speaking of keeping you up , the LED lights on this humidifier are extremely bright . There are two blue lights and they literally light up our entire room . The room can be pitch black and if you have this humidifier on , it will light up the room enough for you to see everything clearly . You ca n't even cover up the lights to darken the room as they are so close to the where the evaporated water comes out , that you 'll block the effect of the device . Again , this was not well designed . Finally , unlike a lot of humidifiers which have permanent filters you clean manually , the Vornado was wick replaceable fillers , making it a money sink and environmentally unfriendly in addition to loud and bright.I would strongly recommend buying something else . The noise , inability to use this in your bedroom and the need to constantly spend money on this humidifier makes me feel your money could be spend on a better ( and possibly cheaper ) humidifier . The negatives just overwhelm the positives with this one .	-1
I received my Vornado humidifier just in time for heating season . I 'm a musician with a boatload of guitars so keeping the proper humidity is crucial to maintaining my collection . I use a whole house humidifier attached to my heating system and also use a large Honeywell evaporation unit in the music room to maintain approximately 50 % humidity year-round . If you have a large room the Honeywell is probably a better unit . I 'm using this new unit to supplement the other humidifiers.What I 've found so far . The unit seems made of light plastic . I do n't have a lot of confidence that this is a solidly built unit . The top which houses the fan assembly and filters is latched on to the tray . To get at the filters ( I recommend flipping them periodically to keep them wet ) you have to unlatch the unit and lift it up . The filters squeeze into the fan unit . I strongly recommend you get some humidifier treatment to keep mold growth to a minimum . You use two filters in this unit , so you also need to buy two-packs of replacement filters . I was happy with the life of the originals . I 'll check out generic brands when it comes time to replace them . One drawback I really do n't like - there is no shutoff when the water runs dry . It will keep pumping air through the filter which will dry it out and shorten the life . I also do n't like the locking mechanism to hold the fill cover to the water reservoir . I much prefer a screw-type cap to a snap-lock . I 'm concerned that when the gasket starts to compress that the tank will leak.The water tank is lightweight and holds a bit over a gallon and a half of water . The unit has a touch control and you can set the percent humidity you want ... a nice feature , but not real accurate . I recommended you get a decent humidity meter and place it in a spot away from the humidifier . By trial and error you 'll get things where you want them . The unit is a bit noisy on high ( most are ) but I was impressed with the quietness of the lower speeds . The manufacturer says it will move air throughout the room . I 'm not sure I can agree with that - it did n't seem to move THAT much air , but who knows ? Having tried several brand and types of room humidifiers , I would say this is probably the second-best one I 've used ... and for a small room like a bedroom it should suffice . In fact our backup plan is to grab this one for the master bedroom whenever one of us gets a cold . I think it 's a bit overpriced considering the overall quality , but with some care and cleaning , it should keep you healthier during the dry spells..UPDATED - 11/27/13My wife developed pneumonia and we set up the humidifier in the bedroom to help her breath . the unit has gotten noisier as time goes on so we ca n't leave it on when we sleep . Also - the blue light is so bright that I ca n't sleep with it on . Finally , the lack of an auto-stop has become a MAJOR inconvenience and it does n't always go on and off the way it should - you sometimes have to adjust the humidity setting or tap the unit to get it to come on.I 'm bumping this down to a `` 2 '' .	-1
I am thinking of returning this item . For some reason it wo n't get the humidity that high . I have it running on high all night long , i go to bed humidity at 49 % i wake up 7 hours later the humidity at 52 % that does n't sound right to me . So that is why i think i will return for a better product if there one out there .	-1
I like these because they look and feel like regular paper towels . they are machine washable and come out softer than prior to washing but so far are holding up well . I applied plastic snaps to the edges and snapped them all back together and put in a wipe dispenser . These wont last forever but they should last a long time and hopefully save money money in the long run.UPDATE : 5/8/14These did n't really hold up well at all for me . You have to wash/dry them within 36 hours or so of using them or they can get moldy and then ruined ... not always a possibility in my situation . We ended up getting rid of them . Sad . I really wanted it to work but I suppose it 's back to filling those landfills again.Did n't end up saving money . Live and learn .	-1
I loved the Ziploc Space Saver bag , and thought I could buy this as a good deal . They vacuum initially , but they lose it after a couple of weeks and defeats the whole purpose . It was too late to return it , Now i just use it to waterproof stuff in my patio . But the Ziploc brand instead , they have worked for me , and they do n't lose vacuum .	-1
I wanted this to work as I have fond memories of bars in Japan where the bartender would carve up a beautiful round ice from a bigger block of perfectly transparent ice with his chisel over a period of five or so minutes . Any eau de vie would last longer and the dilution minimal , yielding a great taste and sensation . Well , this tries to emulate that beautiful round ice but the problem is that much of the four moulds would often yield at most one intact ice . The others would come out broken or in two pieces or more . Instructions are easy and easy to use but results are far from satisfactory .	-1
I watched several you-tube videos and still could n't make them work . A cute gag that i think needs more product research time .	-1
This ice cube tray is really awful -- - it 's hard to fill so that there 's not too much water in there , because what happens is that if you get too much , you just get a clump of ice and it 's impossible to get the individual cubes out . It 's one big mess . Avoid this ! Waste of money , and it was n't cheap for an ice cube tray .	-1
It does n't chop- it grates . I did n't want pieces as small as it 's & # 34 ; course & # 34 ; grind is . It wo n't chop anything else- I tried . Not worth returning , but only buy it if you want very small chips .	-1
The ballon popped . iwwas not even pumping it it was sitting in a bottle of wine on the table and just popped.Do n't buy . they said it was surgical plastic , very strong on Shark Tank . it must be very cheap surgical plastic . Do n't buy .	-1
It was no problem sending this item backThree inches smaller than stated.Good quality fabric ; Would have been better with a bit of elasticWould have been a real chore to attach according to instructionsNo padding is includedAgain , it did n't fit at all , so back to the 'Three inches smaller than stated ' says it all .	-1
This is a small , light-weight ( sort of flimsy ) plastic appliance made in China . I had a similar thing before , but the steamer quit working after a while , probably due to hard-water residue buildup . This one addresses the problem with a filter system that keeps the hard water from wrecking the appliance , which is good . You are supposed to use distilled water in it , which seems kind of silly , buying a special bottle of water to use to clean a dirty floor . Also , you need to occasionally replace the filter.So there are many steps involved in cleaning a floor : buying the special water , filling the reservoir , cleaning the floor , periodically emptying the tray and refilling the reservoir , rinsing out the tray , washing the pad , and buying more filters.So it works , but to me it seems like it 's more trouble than it 's worth , and I doubt I will keep using it . There are low-tech solutions ( broom , mop and pail ) that seem easier to me .	-1
I returned them as they were too grayish . Not what my monitor shows . Did n't open the package , so I do n't know if they were soft or not .	-1
In agreement with the other reviewer who said these do n't hold up in the dishwasher -- they MAY be cast aluminum , but if they are , they 're covered with a shiny silver paint that washes off in the dishwasher . That does n't make me feel too hopeful about their food safeness .	-1
Beware - does not come with shams ! Bought a while back for new home in Austin , TX . Was unaware it did not come with shams . Very pretty , but just make sure you either have , or purchase shams separately .	-1
Do n't do it . Please , do n't buy this thing . Do n't make the same mistake I did . The round press does not press straight down , rather its at an angle . It is 50/50 . Half the garlic goes though the grates , the other half squeezes out the round press inside the cylinder . Poor design and now I am stuck with it . Find something else .	-1
It works fine - a bit slow bringing up the minutes , but nice to have the hour feature and the auto shutoff . But my MAIN purpose in buying it was the loud claim - so I could hear it in an adjacent room . It 's not a bit louder than comparable timers I have .	-1
I received one of these for Christmas and I loved it , that is until it caught on fire due to bad design ! All the grease is supposed to go down the center to the catch tray , but really ends up all over the heating elements and seeps into the base housing storing up as happened in my case . Once I put the fire out , I tipped the base on it 's side and was absolutely blown away when I saw more than two cups of burnt oil pour out of it ! If I had n't been standing beside it when it flamed up , we would be talking about a major lawsuit and or criminal charges at this point ! Do not take the chance !	-1
Boils Water but that 's about it . I ordered this as a replacement for another high quality electric kettle and boy do I regret my old one broke . This one has button dials that are rather annoying if anything to use . The water measure window is in the worst place ever -- -behind the handle where you need to hold it . In order to see where the water level is , you have to look at it from an angle which is n't conducive for accuracy . We returned ours promptly !	-1
It was nice while it lasted . The user interface is pretty terrible but after figuring that out , it was great to have 190 degree water consistently.Half way through heating some water it just quit . Like others have written , the base gives every indication of working but the water does n't heat . No scale buildup or anything like that . I 'm guessing the heating element in the pot has broken.The warranty says I have to pay to ship both ways , that could easily add up to half the purchase price .	-1
I bought my kettle four months ago and now it 's not working . I called Hamilton Beach for them to honor their warranty , but THEY NO LONGER MAKE THIS KETTLE . So , I could have chosen a different kettle , but not a programmable one.I called Amazon and they refunded my money right away . A+ service , Amazon ! : ) Love you guys ! Off to search for a comparable programmable electric kettle . *sigh*	-1
I wanted to love this product but I discovered it has a small , rubber part inside the kettle that comes into contact with boiling water . For me , rubber and hot water do not mix.This is the same issue I have with the Cuisinart programmable kettle I recently bought . The only difference is that it is more inconspicuous in Hamilton Beach kettle.That small , round rubber part apparently serves as a sensor or marker for water level.Otherwise , the controls , handle , spout , mesh , ease of use - are all good.I will contact Hamilton Beach about this issue and possibly make addition to this review , depending on Hamilton Beach 's response.I am currently in the process of returning this product .	-1
While there is nothing obviously wrong with this upgrade , I have to think about the 2002 Sharper Image lawsuit against Consumer Reports for its negative findings on Ionic Breeze air purifier . Granted we are talking Apples and Oranges here . It is hard to claim that cleaning up a tiny surface area of a home with have a tremendous effect on overall air quality due to many factors . These include untouched surfaces , unreachable areas and leakages in the house envelope . An industrial air purifier that guarantees removal of small airborne particles would cost more than the average American home.If Neato wants to sell such products and claim they help allergy sufferers , third party tests should be conducted to proof the upgrade does indeed the capture of various allergens in homes of different vintages and designs .	-1
I got these to pack frozen smoothies in my daughter 's lunch . But the amount they hold is pretty small , much less than she would normally eat . I did a test to see if the smoothies would still be cold enough for her lunchtime , but they were a little on the warm side and quite messy . Cleaning them was no easy task , either . I had to go after them with a soapy paper towel and chopstick to get the inside completely clean . Overall they were a fail for me , and they are now gathering dust in the cabinet .	-1
I would n't recommend because of rust . They are cheap but they are not meant to last . I should have just paid more . Now I am looking for another tong 6 months later.Do n't buy they use a very cheap grade of Stainless steel .	-1
Edit 3/14 : I recently reviewed a coffee machine cleaning product . 3 separate applications of the product did not clear the machine ( The Mr Coffee referred to below unclogged with vinegar ) , so I suspect my issue is mechanical , not a coffee build up . ) The symptoms described immediately below did not change ; if anything they got worse.Edit 10/8/13 : I must have really hard water here , as i ran into a similar problem with a Mr Coffee i previously reviewed , but not to this degree . It now takes around an hour to brew , starts beeping like it 's done within 5 minutes , does not use all the water & at best when full produces 1/2 pot.I have tried the vinegar cleaning method twice with 0 effect . I tried calling customer support , & just burned up cell phone minutes on hold . NOT RECOMMENDED.Edit 1/8/13 : I 'm really having problems living with the extremely small area to pour the water into . I 'm pretty much incapable of hitting the small target without spilling water on the counter . Dropped the pot a star from 4 to 3 for that reason.This is replacing aMr . Coffee JWX39that I reviewed for Vine in December 2011 . The Mr Coffee unit became defective in November of 2012 , so I was grateful for the chance to replace it.So far with one exception I prefer this in every way to the more expensive ( at least this week ) Mr Coffee . Again , I love the Blue Lights ; they 're attractive , useful , & readable . I also prefer that there is n't a nozzle that has to be positioned , & there is n't the moisture condensation issue that the Mr Coffee exhibited . Also , the coffee tastes better ( I recommend the strong setting ; though I do NOT recommend using the 2 ounces of Ground for 12 ounces of coffee the owner 's manual recommends ; that 's WAY too much grounds ! ) .The one thing I do n't like is the area to pour the water into is way too small for my taste , one has to be somewhat careful pouring it in.As I write this , I have n't yet tried the programmable features ; but everything else works great ! It 's also a very attractive appliance . I hope the lights have a fairly long life span , I do n't see any way to replace them.I owned another Krupps many years ago ( a free one that Gevalia was giving away ) & also liked that one quite a bit . While this is a bit higher ( as of 1/3/13 ) than I would usually pay for a coffee maker , if the price does n't concern you , i would definitely recommend the machine.Edit 3/7/14 : I tried a cleaning product on the machine 3 times today , it just made it worse . I suspect there is a mechanical issue .	-1
Why would anyone buy a pastry board without knowing the dimensions ? Are we supposed to guess based on the shipping carton size ? I see more and more of this type of thing here on amazon . It 's great that returns are easy but they also cost money and waste time .	-1
This gets really hot ! I was surprised when I first ran this to see if there were any smells coming off from it , because of how quickly it became hot . Not just warm , but HOT - untouchably hot . I did n't have anything in it the first time so I wondered if it being empty caused this effect . When I ran our Delonghi toaster empty , the outside of it remained cool to the touch -- no heat up , none.It did not get that hot after the first time I used it , but it was still much hotter than any appliance I ever want to use on my counter . The top becomes hotter much more quickly than the body.Yes it did toast evenly , even very thick Wolferman 's muffins . I tend to like my toast browned , somewhere close to burned not lukewarm , and this definitely did it.I guess it is usable but as hot as it is , it should not touch anything else on your counter . That 's not the way my counter works , as I tend to pull out the item that I need to use and then push it back inIt should not be so hot .	-1
I immediately noticed significant inconsistencies with this 10 pack of bags . The first three I picked up out of the pack felt nice and I would n't have hesitated to toss in a bag of apples before jogging up a flight of stairs . Then I noticed that most of the other bags were very light feeling . I gave a VERY slight tug on the handle and it pulled off one side . Then the other followed in suit . I then took the first few and held them up to a light.. could n't see through them very well . The rest of them were so thin you could see right through . They also happened to be the ones in the middle of the pack , which makes me uneasy.I gave in and used the handful of the better bags from the pack . After a couple of days the side split out of one with minimal weight , and the handle pulled off of another . I gave up at this point and decided to return the order . So many people have had good luck with this product ! This leads me to believe that I received an unlucky defective batch , or perhaps they have deteriorated over time in storage ?	-1
As another reviewer said & # 34 ; They are not very tall and the largest one does not cover my whole dinner plate . It rests on the edge. & # 34 ; Wish I had read all the reviews before purchasing . I take responsibility for this poor purchase.I washed them ( in warm soapy water ) prior to using of course and one of the vents came off in the water . Hmmm , wonder how long before the rest come off ? It is not worth my time or money to send back since they were not amazon prime , the shipping was 2.99 . The cheaper ones that I bought proved to be a much better product .	-1
The machine works , but a similar effect can be accomplished by slepping without a cover sheet and using a small , cheaper , quieter fan . As other reviewers have noted , the device is not well made and its plastic components can break easily . The obvious marketing lie about & # 34 ; infinite & # 34 ; levels of power is a lie , indeed - there are 11 levels . This fan does not use a true quiet turbine technology ( such technology is found in many of the better air purifiers , for example ) . It is too loud for the amount of cooling it can provide . It has a high-pitched whine to it that is particularly distracting . Definitely nor worth more than $ 30 , and even then it would be worse than removing the top sheet and using a small , quiet , cheap fan .	-1
Update : 6/23/2013 : I am downgrading my review from two stars to one . I have tried repeatedly to use this juicer and have nothing but problems : It will *not* juice carrots ; it constantly jams . Read below and you will see that I am a very experienced juicer and I have been juicing regularly for 15 years . I now notice that Amazon has a caution up about this product . I do n't know if the reasons are related , but I would wait until that is resolved before you buy . Here is the original review , slightly edited.Before I begin the actual product review I want to say two things : One is that I 'm a very experienced juicer , I bought my first Champion masticating juicerChampion Juicer G5-PG710 - BLACK Commerical Heavy Duty Juicerabout 15 years ago and I loved it . I gave it away ( big mistake ) because it hogged a lot of counter space and it weighed as much as a lawn mower . It was a beast , but it was great ( more about it in a minute ) . I also own a BrevilleBreville BJE200XL Compact Juice Fountain 700-Watt Juice Extractora centrifugal ( non-masticating ) juicer . For those new to juicing , a centrifugal-type juicer basically chops up what you insert and then spins at a very high rate to create juice ( that 's a horrible definition , but Google the types and you 'll read more ) ; a masticating juicer uses an auger to grind that stuff up . When you have a good masticating juicer you end up with dry pulp in the pulp catcher and clear , pulp-free juice ( and lots more of it ) in the juicer catcher . Centrifugal juicers are faster and cheaper , but produce less juice . The pulp coming out of a centrifugal juicer is usually quite wet -- an obvious sign that not all of the juice has been extracted.OK , second , there is often a lot of fuss in reviews about what a pain they are to use , that you have to chop things , peel some things , and that they take forever to clean up . All of this is somewhat true . But anyone who juices knows this is n't an instant high -- you have to be willing to put 15 mins of work ( including set up and clean up ) to get a couple nice glasses of fresh juice . Also , fresh produce is not cheap in many parts of the country , so juicing is not always that cheap . Still , for those willing to put in a small amount of effort , the beauty of creating your own fresh juice in any blend you want ( and organically if you buy organic produce ) is a wondrous thing.So , that said , here are my thoughts on this NS-950 juicer , in pro and con fashion and I will tell you in advance , I am not thrilled with this juicer . It has a lot of issues.Pros : * It 's a nice looking juicer and has a good solid feel and a nice big handle for moving it around . I like the handle a great deal . * It seems well made , it is solid , though I 'm not thrilled with all of its design aspects . * I like the design of the juice catcher and the pulp catcher . * It has a 10-year warranty . That is very impressive given that most kitchen appliances give you a year . We 'll see if they honor it.Cons : * There is nothing even remotely intuitive about assembling this . ALL juicers take some getting used to and you have to read the manuals carefully . The drawings in almost all manuals are hideous ( the drawings for this are OK , but too small ) and so , before you get too frustrated , you really have to take time in learning to assemble and disassemble these things . This is worse than most of them : it took me nearly a half an hour to figure out what went where -- AFTER I read the manual a few times . Some things seem well designed ( the upper juice configuration snaps on solidly to the base , for example ) , but some seem less than great ( the auger is awkward to insert ) . * The manual is somewhat light on details and advice , I think . It is adequate , but just barely . The juice booklet they give you with it has some great ideas for juicing but it was translated by someone for whom English is obviously a second ( or third ) language . How is this for a lulu of a sentence : `` It is recommendable to drink natural juice in order to absorb all retained nutrients . '' Huh ? And it gets much worse . Hey , I 'm a technical writer , hire me to write your manual . * It JAMMED on the first use . I was making a mix of red delicious apples and carrots and it jammed on 4 '' lengths of carrot . I have never had a juicer jam before . They say when this happens , just hit the reversing button and it should clear . Not even close . I had to disassemble the entire upper juicing component and then use my fingers to scrape out the carrots so I could restart it . That to me is a deal breaker . If you were using a Champion juicer ( the one mentioned above ) you would never see it jam on anything . Ever . You can grind bricks with a Champion , I think ( yes , joking ) . This unit works fine on soft fruits but I bought this to make carrot juice . Grade ? F.* The pulp exit tube is FAR TOO SMALL . It 's really a joke . The exit tube for pulp on the Champion is well over an inch in diameter , I think , but this one is tiny . IT was constantly jammed and each time I clean this unit I have to insert a small tool ( a chopstick works ) into the exit area to clean it out . Wow , what a pain ! * The chute for inserting produce is tiny compared to my Champion or my Breville juicers . You have have to cut everything into tiny pieces . What a pain . * It is not silent ! It 's not particularly loud or annoying ( though they warn you of a strange screeching noise that it makes ) but it 's not even close to silent . It does SCHREECH at you ! My conclusion ? I would not spend $ 400-500 on this juicer . Research other brands of masticating juicers and think about owning a Champion . There is , I gather , a reason most juice bars use Champion juicers and I regret that I gave mine away . As I said , I also own a Breville ( $ 100 ) compact juicer and while it is not as efficient at extracting juice , it 's a ton easier to use and to clean . And it does a darn good job . I 've been using the Breville for a couple of years and I 'm very happy with it . So , if you want a fast , inexpensive and reliable juicer , check out that Breville ( I have a review on that page ) . If you want a solid masticating juicer , check out Champion or read more online reviews.I 'm not giving up on this juicer . I will keep using it because I like to make sure I give everything a fair shake . And I think this unit *did* produce quality juice that was clear and free of pulp . ( By the way , you can save the pulp you create with any juicer and use it to make muffins -- it 's fantastic , so keep that in mind if you 're baking and juicing the same day . ) But for now , much as I hate to be unkind , having a juicer jam on me is a real deal breaker . I 'd give this 3 or even more stars based on its solid feel and quality juice , but I ca n't give it that because of it jamming on carrots , so I 'm giving it only two ( maybe 2.5 ) based on that and its somewhat outrageous price . If you disagree with my review , please feel free to comment . I can sometimes be persuaded to upgrade if I think I 've been unfair .	-1
This juicer has too many things going against it , so it is a disappointment . There are lots of parts , but not enough instructions . Cleaning , even with the touted 'tool ' is not easy . There are not enough recipes . The pieces of food have to be cut into small bits to insert , which defeats the purpose . I have had it awhile , to give it time to grow on us , but it is not happening .	-1
I loved the picture of this set , however when i recived it , it was already fraying all over . I also went to take the tag off , and it ripped the pillow case . It does n't feel or look nearly as nice as it does in the picture .	-1
The first thing I noticed upon taking everything out of the bag , is that the neck roll is lumpy , as stated in other reviews . That 's not a deal breaker for me since I see it as more of a decoration . Then when I spread the comforter over the bed , I noticed 2 spots that were really bunched up . It turns out they made mistakes at the factory and stitched up two holes . Maybe 2 '' long each . So , this thing will never lay completely flat.I also would n't recommend using the pillow cases it comes with . The pattern has a slightly scratchy feel . I hung these on my headboard as a decoration and used the pillow cases that came with my sheet set instead , which are very soft and comfortable.Elegant Comfort 1500 Thread Count Egyptian Quality WRINKLE & FADE RESISTANT ULTRA SOFT LUXURY 4 pcs Bed Sheet Set , Deep Pocket Up to 16 '' - FULL , BurgundyThe only positive thing I can say is that it 's a nice pattern and looks decent in my bedroom . But the neck roll and two stitched up mistakes are unacceptable . I 'm just waiting for it to fall apart as stated in some other reviews I just read . The only reason I did n't return it is because I 'd never be able to get everything back in the bag . I 'll still get use out of it , but for the $ 80 I paid I expected slightly better quality .	-1
I have n't even had this thing for a year yet and I 'm ready to throw it away . While I love the color/design and it fits the bed nicely . The problem is the seams do not seem to hold up very well . In the bottom center of the comforter where the thick black line is ( not the very bottom part , the black line above it ) the seam has started separating . There is about a 7 & # 34 ; hole in the middle of the comforter now . Also on one of the corners the seam started to come loose and ripped the fabric . I guess you get what you pay for . I will keep it on the bed for a little while longer , but I am gon na be in the market for a new comforter set very soon . This is just unacceptable .	-1
I am a Vornado die-hard , own 5 of 733B but this tower fan really let me down . It 's super weak and noisy , the speed # 1 is so weak while speed # 4 is super noisy plus the wind is not strong . I got this one on Amazon 's deal of the day and decided to give it a shot for the design and the location where I want to place it . Get 733B if you need a real fan .	-1
I 've been a long time fan of Vornado and I 've got over ten of their `` whole room fans '' in my house . When this fan showed up on Amazon 's gold box , I figured I 'd give it a try.What works well -This is my first remote controlled Vornado . So far , so good . It 's been about four months of usage and the remote works flawlessly.With the fan on the lower two settings , the fan is relatively noiseless ( for a fan anyway ) and it still moves air well.What 's going wrong -As many other reviewers have mentioned , at the 3rd and 4th setting ( the higher settings ) the fan is pretty loud - even for a Vornado . Unfortunately , for the noise is makes , it does n't push as much air as it sounds like it should . Compared to a normal Vornado whole room circulator , I 'd say it does maybe half the actual air volume ( at least it feels that way ) .The other problem with the fan is that you can only feel the air from a very specific point . Move slightly to the right or left of the silver line and you wo n't feel a thing . It 's very much like it 's moving a blade of air . So if you like indirect air movement , this is not the fan for you.Conclusion -Stick with the normal Vornado fans , this tower fan just is n't a great addition to the Vornado line up .	-1
THIS IS SHORT AND SWEET . PLEASE REMEMBER THAT THESE TOWER TYPE FANS CAN NOT BE TAKEN APART AND CLEANED LIKE A REGULAR BLADE TYPE FAN . UNLESS YOU PLACE A SOFT SCREEN or MESH/NYLON STOCKING 'SOCK ' OVER THE INTAKE IT GETS CLOGGED WITH LINT AND DUST EVENTUALLY . Who wants lint and dust sprayed all over from a fan full of it ? SO- although the fan itself is great , until they come take-apart-able to clean -- it wil only last until you need to clean it unless you like a dusty breeze ! USE a nylon sock over the intake if you want a clean wind ! *Comments suggest using a leaf blower ( friends say it 's easy to break the fan this way ) or air compressor blow out to clean the fan . Never tried it ; one friend did and broke the fan when it tumbled away ... ..but it did clean it . The comment states to have TWO people -- one to hold the fan . I agree ! Good luck . Nylon sock is easier ! You can get them in colors , designs etc , just shake it out in the shower and it 's clean.Aloha	-1
was excited to get this for grandkids who are too big for sippy cups . Too large to fit medium sized cups and glasses . Very disappointed and waste of money to send back .	-1
Disappointed , I thought this came with the cup , my error I guess . Now to find a non plastic cup that these will fit on will be the challenge . Does anyone have any suggestions . I do not want to use plastic .	-1
these clips with the clear 'sticky backing strips ' are n't as strong as the non clear versions.. the strip is almost paper thin and does n't hold a lot of weight at all.. we use them for ornaments in our windows.. 9 out of the 10 have fallen off where the last type of clip by Command held strong.. I would n't recommend these if you 're needing any kind of significant weight on them.. like a Christmas ornament or lights.. they wo n't hold for very long..	-1
After seeing the commerical for these clips , I thought they sounded like a great buy . Big mistake ! with arthritic hands VERY hard do use . They held nothing and damaged some precious objects . I would return them , but use so many trying to get them to work . Maybe it 's me , But I 'll never recommend these to anyone ,	-1
I feel this is a dangerous item to sell . It is very hard to press down . I was pressing down slowly on this french press and the glass portion exploded and the boiling water splashed out all over my chest and arm burning me . I would highly not recommend this product as it is dangerous .	-1
I 'd go 2.5 stars if it were an option - it 's sort-of half worthwhile.If this item sold without the top 'rack ' , and for a lesser price , of course , it would probably be worth it ; the construction / use of the bottom section seems ok . But , after hanging a few dress shirts , a couple of tshirts , and 2 light cardigans on the top rail , it collapsed - on my first use . The combined weight of the hanging items were n't heavy , but the design makes the overall structure unstable , which allowed the top rack to lean a bit , and once I added those items to the top bar , it quickly dropped sideways and the plastic fittings snapped.The problem is n't the pipes / bars . The problem is that the fasteners to hold that rack in place are basic plastic , and not designed to take any sort of load . I was skeptical of the top rack staying up on it 's own , without anything hung on it , and even though I had it tightened down . So , basically , it ( sadly ) performed as expected.I did n't check the return policy yet ... we 'll see whether it 's worth the effort . If not , hopefully the bottom section will hold up long enough for me to get my money 's worth out of the overall contraption .	-1
Got these at the end of February . I peel an orange almost every day . Today the nib that goes under the skin to cut broke off one . Definitely not a quality product . I think they should send me a new one .	-1
Dose not hold any of my glasses way too thin ! I have 6 pairs of eveyglasses and not one fit . Do n't waste your money .	-1
I use an aero press to make coffee and a fine grind is necessary . This grinder makes percolator size chunks mixed in with some fine grind and it just does n't work for me . It 's otherwise a great grinder : compact size , not excessively noisy and the burr is very easy to clean . That does n't make it good enough for what I need .	-1
This lightweight grinder struggles to grind the beans , then whines loudly if the grinder is still working when all the beans are ground . The built-in timer , which is supposed to grind the beans for a pre-selected number of cups , is so far off that I simply put it on the maximum number , then use the on/off switch to control the grinding time . It has 9 different grinds , supposedly from fine to course , but it actually grinds from super fine to fine ... not adequate for my French press coffee maker . After the beans are ground , static electricity keeps the bean dust on the sides and lid of the container , and it has to be tapped down . There is always a mess on the counter after using . I 've now ordered the Capresso , which I 've had and loved before , but , based on reviews of this model , decided to purchase to save about $ 50- $ 60 . Big mistake .	-1
Warming is too slow.Frothing has a strange results that the foam has kind of dirty appearance.Timer is not good either , best result is to manually stop it a lot sooner than the timer.Do like the non-sticky surface , easy to clean .	-1
I am old ( 45 ) , and my entire life I have seen the same bull passed on and on , get real people this stuff is fakeI am an avid cook and decided it was finally time to throw this non-stick cook ware to good-will . And Get a SS SetI had to set my range on pretty high heat to sear with this set.My fried eggs come out steamed . The discoloration ( called heat marks ) after a month my pans looked old and warpped.Some of the Knives are the best , as I have three that are 7 years old and still sharp . I still do not like the pans . I gave the set to goodwill and kept the lids and with the set ( I got my set at THE NAVY EXCHANGE in Mayport . we had a rep doing a demo and gave out free knives and hubby felt like he should buy the set because we got a free knive.SO YES I HAD THE SET ! ! ! good grief you trolls who have nothing better to do then troll the ZON and give people a hard time because they left a neg review . This is still America and I can say and do whatever the heck I want . Freedom of Speech you UGLA TROLL from TX	-1
Since the very first day we used this kettle , we 've been disappointed and frustrated . If you try to pour more than a dribble at a time , water comes pouring out of the sides of the pot and NOT out of the spout . It 's dangerous and poorly designed .	-1
I was looking for a portable battery operated fan to use on a baby stroller , so when this popped up I thought I would give it a try . However , that clip portion is WAY too big to fit comfortably on a stroller .	-1
This bag is silly . The & # 34 ; liquid block & # 34 ; is an absorptive pad , could get the same result with a paper towel . Should have saved my money . Meat can be vacuum-packed in the regular bags just by blotting it thoroughly and setting the machine on & # 34 ; moist & # 34 ; ...	-1
Works as it is supposed to , but just does n't do an adequate job of vacuuming out all the air .	-1
EDIT:3 months on , I 'm pretty disenchanted with this product . I 've gone through two new sets of bags and about 3/4 of them do n't hold their seals . The mason jar seal does n't hold as well as I 'd thought , either.As for the marinating bin : It simply does not fit the seat of this particular device . How lame is that ? _________________Original review : This is a great little device that does exactly what it says . Very powerful for its size , unlike other hand-held vacuum sealers I 've tried . Not as noisy as the less-powerful ones too.It 's a little fussy about seating , but that 's easy enough to work out . Just rock it ever-so-slightly in different directions until a seal is achieved and you 're good to go.The bags could use more quality control . A quarter of them wo n't hold their seal , which is unacceptable given how much they cost.I bought a mason jar lid separately and it works great . Perfect vacuum every time and the seal holds fast.Have n't tried the marinating bin yet but will edit this review when I have .	-1
I 'm so upset I bought this air-popper without researching it first on other sites . As another reviewer observed , it 's obvious the `` 5-star '' reviews were all written at the same time by either the same person , or a group paid to write misleading positive reviews.Although the popper works as described , the resulting popped corn is tough and chewy . At first , my husband and I thought it was the corn itself - that it was old and stale . ( Does popping corn even go stale ? ) But after trying three different brands of new popping corn , and then finally ( duh ! ) researching air-poppers , we realized it 's the popper , not the corn . Air poppers deliver tough , chewy popcorn . Because it heats up so fast , the kernel does n't have time to get hot enough , and the kernel does n't fully pop open - leaving you with chewy popcorn that still has part of a hard , inedible kernel.There 's no better popcorn than the crunchy , fluffy movie popcorn , but since most of us ca n't afford a commercial popper , the next best way is making popcorn on the stove . But you need to use a good bit of oil , and then you have the messy pot and stovetop to clean . Then there 's Jiffy Pop , but after all the bad press about aluminum over the years , do we really want to use aluminum over high temperatures ? Not to mention the trans-fat in Jiffy Pop . And as we know now , microwave popcorn is one of the most toxic products we can consume , so that 's out . I 've tried the microwave-in-the-lunch-bag trick , but I just could n't get it to work properly . Most of the kernels did n't pop and/or the bag burned . Sigh . What 's a popcorn-loving-movie-buff to do ? I do n't want to spend the money on one , but I 'm thinking about the Stir-Crazy popper . They 're pricey , but in this case , maybe you DO get what you pay for . I 'll research my purchase completely this time , that 's for sure . In the meantime , maybe I 'll use this air-popper to roast nuts or something .	-1
This product did not fit my roomba like it said it would so now I have to ship it back and try to find another one that will ! Very DISAPOINTED and frustrated with it all ! ! ! If I could give no stars I would !	-1
The box reeked before I could even open it . I left these brushes outside for a week before they smelled decent enough to have indoors . Once I tried to use this , it wo n't go into the Roomba because it 's so twisted . The seams on the parts are terrible because it is poorly poorly made . Sent it back , ordering OEM .	-1
I purchased this stove instead of the Dimplex model that is almost identical because I liked the design of the door better and I thought that Duraflame was a respected brand . I know someone that has the Dimplex and absolutely loves it . I read the reviews of the Dimplex and there are tons of them and almost all extremely positive . I thought the fact that there were only a few reviews for this stove might be because it was newer to the market . The stove looks fine . Was delivered in good condition , and is easy to just plug in . No assembly of any kind . The flame is a resonable facsimile of a real fire , so all that is fine . But within a few weeks the motorized parts that rotate to make the look of fire started to make noise . Also , the heat blower makes noise . So the fire plus the blower make some pretty audible noise . If you turn off the heat blower you have what is essentially an annoying noise that actually makes me have to turn the TV up louder . Sometimes the noise gets quiter . Sometimes it gets louder . It would be too much trouble to return it so I 'm stuck with it . I 'll never order something this large from Amazon again .	-1
This is overall a well built wok , except the fact that food does stick to the surface and it 's hard to clean . We are Chinese and I serve mainly stir fry dishes . This wok can do most of the stir fry vegetables flawlessly . Problems are with eggs and shredded meat . I have learned to use this wok for vegetables only . DO NOT USE this work for eggs . You 'll need to soak it overnight to clean . After drying , you might see a layer of white powdery residue that 's not grease . So I end up rinsing the wok before I use it . This beautiful green wok will ink brown after a few times which is not a problem at all.Also , if this is the first time you purchase ceramic coating cookware , you need to know it does NOT deliver heat efficiently as anodized surface . It 's not a good choice if you plan to cook authentic Chinese stir fry dishes.Again , overall this wok is built solid to last . You will be very happy with this product if you do not expect non-stick .	-1
The design only has 3 legs . It tipped very easy . I ended up going with a different crock pot . I would n't attempt the art is beautiful but the design of the crock pot is useless and dangerous .	-1
Do n't believe the description , the bags are NOT drawstring . They have metal handles . I live in an apartment with no washer/dryer and have to take my laundry out . I have to move the laundry from the bags to my own bags . This is fine and I like the look and build of the rack , but I had to dock it major points for inaccurate description .	-1
This thing is huge . It takes up an obnoxious amount of space . I would suggest picking a different one if you do n't have a designated laundry room to put this in . I have a huge master bedroom and I still felt like this took up too much space .	-1
Horrible . Did n't last long , broke hence it got thrown away . Not very sturdy nor value for price . Sellers are great , product as very disappointing	-1
I am from Germany . And after moving to the USA a few weeks ago , I decided to replace my old Melitta brand kettle from home with a new one , because of the different electric current.Verdict : This Melitta 40994 is a total let down.It takes ages to heat up.Though it feels good and solid in the hand , real powerful with brushed metal , 1,7 liters of water ( the max ) take endless minutes to come to a boil.My old one was much better.A really lame appliance !	-1
I have an Oxo Apple slicer that really zips through Apples . Great product but the slices are not thin enough , so I always have to finish up with a knife to cut each slice in half . Since the slicer is sharp and cores the apple at the same time , it 's still worth using.This Progress International slicer makes perfectly sized slices , but the blade is not sharp enough to do get through the apples without a lot of force . I 'm talking pounding it down.Why bother ?	-1
It looks pretty , it 's very sturdy but I have not had any success in being able to cut an apple all the way through . I have managed to nick my fingers trying to get the apple untstuck so I can just cut it up using a regular knife . I have seen the ones with bigger slices work , but this one was just a challenge .	-1
I took a chance with this one after reading the mixed reviews , it worked great for a few days , they after chopping a tomato two blade came out of the smallest grid so now its useless to me because that is the size I mainly use . I did use the cheese grater and that worked great and the v-shaped slicer on some cucumbers , really does help cut down on prepping time . But its going back !	-1
BLADES FALL OUT ON THE SOFTEST STUFF TO SLICE ! I SLICED MY VEGGIES IN SMALL FLAT SECTIONS BY THE 3RD OR 4TH PIECE THE BLADES FELL OUT ON AL OF THE PARTS , A WASTE OF TIME & GARBAGE	-1
Do n't buy it . Some part of the attachment was broke when I got it and it fell apart . I had a Vidalia chop wizard for a long time and it broke so I thought I would buy this because it had more attachment . The plastic is very cheap and it want chop it is very weak .	-1
I bought this thinking I could drink out of it at work . NOPE . Its more of a toy for looks kinda think . maybe a good pen holder	-1
My mug arrived damaged , with a crack down both sides - practically ready to break into two . It appeared to be poorly packaged . As others stated , the mug does n't feel as solid as others , which may have contributed to the problem . Overall , not sure if it was a packing or design problem ( maybe both ) , but at any rate I do n't recommend buying this mug at this point . Amazon says they are addressing some issues with this product . Hopefully packaging is one issue being addressed . It 's a shame because these are awesome mugs ! If shipping issues appear to be taken care of I may attempt to order another .	-1
I received this in a timely manner . That 's the only good thing . I washed it , used it once for coffee and once it was empty I noticed a crack on the inside . Very light weight and flimsy . I do not recommend this to anyone ! !	-1
I like the design . The color and size were great as well . But about a week after I started using this cup , the handle snapped clean off ... while I was holding it and it was about half filled with hot coffee . The cup broke when it hit the floor , splashing coffee seemingly everywhere , and I received a shallow cut on the palm of my hand for the trouble . Not that it matters compared to the broken handle , but the recycling symbol was also crooked and not centered .	-1
I know that if you know how to use these you will not have any issues , but I kept messing up pumping them up and leaving the lid on tight during storage . I realize it is user error , but just too much trouble for me . Not worth it .	-1
I was hoping for something much thicker and durable . The sheets are very thin feeling . It says 600 thread count , but it feels like a 250-300 thread count . Not sure where the & # 34 ; Microfiber & # 34 ; comes from , because it does n't represent a traditional microfiber feel . I thought I was getting a great deal , but instead , I got what I paid for . I 've ordered Damask Stripes from another brand off Overstock at 600 Thread before , figured it was the same , it 's not at all close .	-1
There is nothing on the tab that goes under the mattress so keep it in place . Sure , it will stay it there is nothing in the caddy but put just a single book in there and onto the floor it goes . Can be fixed with some rubber like shelf liner but should n't have to do that with a new product . Material is floppy too so it 's hard to see into the pockets . Could try starching it but should n't have to do that either . Why ca n't it just be made to work . I do n't like it much .	-1
Great for beginners if you are looking for a good nice grinder check out chromium crusher might be costy but well worth it	-1
Opened the box , took out the blender and the first thing I noticed was that the gears were made of plastic . I knew that this would n't last long so I immediately sent it back .	-1
The only good thing about this is that it lathers . That 's it . If you want to lather it up though , you need to pump the brush through the ceramic holder and that just splatters gross water all over the place . Seriously not functional.It takes a while to clean a greasy dish.You can get to the nooks and crannies of a cup since the brush is too big.It 's practically useless . Just do n't buy it .	-1
Sent them back because the color was more of a orange than a red . I was looking for a candy apple red in color .	-1
THIS ITEM IS LOOKING GOOD . THE STYLE IS CUTE . THE WATER IS FAST BOIL . IT HAS A PROBLEM THAT IS RUSTING RIGHT AWAY AFTER VERY FIRST TIME USE IT ALSO THE WATER COOKED DONE WILL TURN LIKE OIL IN IT . IT 'S JUST LIKE COOKING WATER WITH COOKING OIL TOGETHER . I TESTED MANY TIMES OF DUMPED THE WATER AND COOKE AGAIN AND AGAIN BUT TOTALLY I STILL SAW THE SAME PROBLEM NO CHOICE EVEN I BOUGHT 2 ITEMS OF TOTAL THE SAME EXACTLY PROBLEM TO ME . I 'M REALLY CURIOUS EVEN I USED THE BOTTLE WATER STILL HAS THE PROBLEM WITH THIS ITEM . I DO N'T KNOW OF SURE WHY PEOPLE GIVE SO MANY GOOD COMMENT 5 STARS . I NEED ELECTRIC KETTLE FOR SAVE MY TIME SPEND IN THE KITCHEN AND IT HANDFUL . I HAVE NO CHOICE RETURNED THE PRODUCT TO AMAZON AND MAYBE FIND BETTER ONE . I AM FEELING OF RETURNED THIS ITEM BECAUSE THE SIZE OF IT IS JUST RIGHT FOR ME NEED BUT TOO BAD CA N'T USE NOT SURE OF WHY LIKE THAT TOO ME .	-1
Works well for the first month and then turns to garbage . SO MUCH sticking . Do n't waste your money . Get a T-Fal Professional if you want an inexpensive non-stick pan ( recommended by Cooks Illustrated ) or stick with high-quality stainless like All-Clad .	-1
I 've been looking for scratch resistant ceramic cookware . I purchased this small set to test the product and see if it holds up to the claims . It does n't ! There are three fundamental problems with this cookware : The first problem I found when cooking with these pans is the ceramic inside of the pan . The pans has a very thin ceramic coating that easily chips and scratches . Here 's an example : I was done cooking your our meal ; and you place the pans in the sink to wash afterwards . I had placed a few spoons in the sink along with a ceramic bowl in the pan to soak with soapy water , so that I could clean them later . Either one of the spoons or the ceramic bowl left a scratch in the coating.The second problem is in the design of the bottom of the pans . The bottoms are textured with sharp edges , very abrasive and discolor within weeks of use . God forbid you stack the cookware on top of each other , after cleaning and storing in the cabinet ! The design of the pan bottoms cause scratches to the interior of the `` ceramic coating , '' when you put them in the sink.The third and probably the biggest problem with this cookware is the fact that they state in the documentation that you can only cook at moderate temperatures . In other words , you can not sear foods at high temperatures , nor pan or deep fry.I do n't want cookware that you have treat with kid gloves ! At the end of the day , this is n't really ceramic cookware . it 's evident and proven on the company website under their warranty section , `` Warranty LIMITED LIFETIME WARRANTY ( WearEver Cookware '' The warranty does n't cover anything . `` This warranty does not cover staining , discoloration or scratching of the non-stick interior or the aluminum , porcelain enamel or stainless steel exterior . `` See for yourself : [ ... ]	-1
I had bought this because I really love the crystal light lemonade and pink lemonade powder packets you put in your water but this tastes NOTHING like them at all . It has a really strong artificial - sweetener flavor , almost so much so that I cant even drink it . Wo n't buy again .	-1
I honestly have no clue why this received so many positive reviews . People loved that it moves up and down while it oscillates and there might be an air circulation factor , but does it really need to point upwards the full 90 degrees ? I think something potentially positive has been turned into a gimmick.Apart from that , it does n't come close to cooling the medium sized bedroom I have on even warmish nights . Sitting about 10 feet from it , I feel very faint air as it passes me.Never have I been so mislead by positive reviews . Maybe it works fine sat on a desk 3 feet from ones head but I assure you , for any other purpose , this is a waste of money .	-1
Not quiet . But not only that , the quality of sound it made was very annoying whine.I would n't have bought it if the description did n't say & # 34 ; ultra quiet & # 34 ; on the description.I 've learned that most companies lie when the advertise fan quietness.Could n't even use it in the living room from the annoying noise it made.Returned it .	-1
This refrigerator/freezer thermometer does not work and I do not have time to look into it in order to figure out why .	-1
I have ordered and returned this item twice . I ordered it because I love the large numbers shown in photo . I returned each thermometer because the battery ca n't be activated . The instructions say to insert an opened paperclip into the small hole on the left to open the battery drawer to remove the piece of mylar that is protecting the battery during shipment . Unfortunately I found it impossible to open said battery drawer , so matter how hard I tried . At least Amazon has been their usual fantastic Customer Service selves , and I was n't willing to waste Amazon 's time to try for a third time .	-1
First I could n't get this timer out of its wrappings.Then I could n't get the batteries in because it requires a microscopic Phillips head screwdriver.Then the buttons were really hard to push.It never wanted to re-set.It 's too heavy for its magnet so if you put it on the refrigerator it slides down.The little plastic stand that makes it stand up on the counter snapped off.Then it falls over face-down on the counter . It looks like a drunken timer.It 's really loud unless you turn the volume down and then it 's inaudible.It 's aesthetically challenged.Yesterday I decided to give it another chance but the timer started running forward and I could n't stop it.So I decided to test its waterproof qualities.And you know ... it stayed up , bobbing and counting up for a really long time.But finally it sank and stopped counting forward.It 's dead now.Hasta la vista , Taylor Timer .	-1
I 've been using this Taylor timer for about a month now . Normally I have good experience with Taylor products but that was n't the case for me this time . In my opinion the design of this timer was focused more on specs than user experience . Case-in-point : -when I opened up this timer I could n't believe I needed to search around for a small screwdriver to unscrew the battery compartment - that 's a deal killer right there for something as simple as a timer ( I have other waterproof devices that are easier to change batteries on ) .-Actually getting the timer to work is not as intuitive as it should be . My 8-year old daughter could n't figure out how to get the timer running ( but on her own she makes videos , plays wii , surfs the internet , etc ) .-This timer is bigger and bulkier than it needs to be for its function in life . Plus the fridge magnet is not very effective at holding this timer because it is big and bulky ( eg ; slides down my fridge ) .-The plastic screen seems to have come loose on mine when someone pushed down on the screen.So , the intention is good on this timer to be a durable timer but the user experience offsets this . At $ 16 in consideration of price/value and alternate products readily available my rating is 2-stars .	-1
I have a number of other kitchen timers , but am always misplacing them around the house so was happy to try another one out . Pros and cons of this one : Pros:1 . Water and impact resistant . I have to say , I 've never had a timer die on me from getting wet but I guess if you want to use it outside this might come in handy . Likewise I 've dropped timers many times and never had one break as a result , so not sure how much benefit the rubber bumper is . But if this is an issue for you , I do expect the bumper is more likely to prevent damage.2 . Easy to use . I did n't have too much trouble figuring out how to use this , it was pretty simple and intuitive.3 . Includes clock and backlight . Many kitchen timers do n't include the clock feature or backlight which I did appreciate.4 . Fairly large display . Good if you have issue with reading smaller displays.Cons1 . Magnets are this are VERY weak . One has to wonder if they even tested them in normal kitchen environments because they simply are not strong enough for the weight of the timer . This is completely unacceptable for a ktichen timer , as so many of us want to store them on our fridge or microwave , etc.2 . Very hard to open battery compartment . This is the big downside of having water resistance , the battery compartment does not just slide open as most do , you have to use a tiny Phillips to open it . If you do n't have a eyeglass repair kit or other screwdriver for VERY tiny screws you are going to be stuck without a way to even install batteries.3 . Can only set one timer . Most of my timers allow for setting up to 2-4 timers at once . This only does one , which is rather disappointing.4 . Very large size . While I appreciate having a larger display , it takes up less than half of the front of the timer , this is hardly the most pocketable of timers that I 've used.5 . Fairly poor stand . Considering that the magnets work so poorly , I would have liked a much better stand that this has , it 's very thin and flimsy and I have my doubts that it will last very long.Overall , this is a timer I would be very hesitant to recommend .	-1
This Taylor time is not very useful . Things I dislike : ~ The LCD screen has a narrow viewing angle , so you ca n't lay the timer flat , nor can the time be vertical on the counter and clearly seen.~ Setting the times and resetting is a pain , pressing buttons like you were setting a watch . Not the kind of ease I want in a kitchen timer.~ Installing the batteries requires that you use a mini philips screwdriver , like for glasses or electronics.~ The magnets are weak and slippery . It slides down the front of my fridge.~ The sounds are annoying , more like a honk or alarm than a reminder bell I 'd like to hear around the house~ It says it 's only good for a 4 foot drop , but what happens if it falls off a shelf or from the top of the fridge ? ~ The rubberizing is a flimsy , removable bumper~ The light is uneven and lights for just a few moments .	-1
This timer requires a tiny Phillips head screwdriver in order to insert the batteries . My dilemma : do I go out and pay money to buy a tiny screwdriver set just to insert the batteries in a timer that probably costs less than the screwdriver set ? Answer : no . Why a manufacturer would make it so difficult to use a kitchen timer is beyond me . It 's a kitchen timer , for goodness sake ! It should not require buying a screwdriver set and then having to unscrew the tiny screws and insert batteries in order to make it work . So not user-friendly .	-1
This is a bad design and will not hold any weight . So all of the neat pockets are empty and it still wo n't stay put . Bad , Bad , Bad design . Product material was good .	-1
This did not stay under the mattress easy . I am going to return it . Not what I expected at all .	-1
I liked these placemats at first . They were exactly what I wanted : easy to clean and matched our dining table . However , after using them for a month , sections of the print has been rubbed off . I 'm guessing it 's from plates being moved around on the placemat . So now we have white splotches here and there on the mats . I still use them when we do n't have company , but I 'd never take them out in front of guests .	-1
Spend a couple extra dollars and buy a stronger plastic product . Did n't hold the form of the shot glass real well . Yes , you could still take about half a shot out of these , but they still were not up to snuff .	-1
After using this device with a number of different coffees , quantities , grinds and brew times , it just did n't quite make it for me . The one major plus is the low cost . If you want a fresh brewed cup of coffee , do n't have a Keurig or other single serve machine and do n't want to spend the bucks on the Chemex , then this would be your ticket . However , getting a good cup is subject to a lot of variables , so getting a consistently good cup of coffee is really challenging.Pros- price , super affordable- easy to clean- easy to useCons- the black fabric makes it really difficult to know if the coffee is brewed to your liking- consistent cup of coffee is really difficult to achieve , even if you use the same coffee all the timeHowever , if you are really wanting a single serve cup o ' Joe , I think the Starbuck 's VIA is a better cup . While it 's more expensive per cup , it 's more compact ( I always have a few of these in my handbag ) and you 're always assured of a good cup of coffee .	-1
First off , this does not make a good cup of coffee . Second , have fun washing it in the dishwasher , it capture a lot of food particles ! ! ! Oops ... Third , from the photo , I thought it was coming with the great primula glass mug . Nope . All around a bad deal .	-1
Sometimes you just need a single cup of coffee , but frankly , this is n't Grandma 's favorite way to produce one . While thePrimula Coffee Brew Buddy Single Cup Coffee Maker , Redis an OK tea strainer , it certainly is n't a substitute for either a drip coffee maker or a French press . Worse , it is miserable to clean.Grandma 's $ 0.02 - Grab a cuppa on the go instead . Not worth the mess !	-1
the drinking hole opening lid has two tiny cheap plastic knobs holding them in place and wore down and broke with regular use on mine . I own multiple bubba kegs and love them all dearly except this bad apple . others last years , this last a month .	-1
I love the concept of this tray and I really wanted to love it , but alas it was not meant to be . First off , my tray arrived broken . The handle on one side was broken off to one of the corners . The box was fine so it must have been shipped that way . Second , this tray is really small . I have fairly small dinner plates and they do not even come close to fitting this tray . I tested out the non-stick piece of this tray before I returned it and that was a very nice feature and seemed to work well . I do not write many one star reviews , but I wanted my review to stick out so that other buyers are aware .	-1
Was dissatisfied with filters . Wanted some other kind of filter I guess cause I got grounds in my coffee cup .	-1
Even thou I read the negative reviews , I thought I could get better results from the filters and save some money at the same time . I wish that I had heeded the advice of those who had experinced disappoitment with their filters . No matter how I tried to adjust the measurement , paper filter ( X2 ) , temperature etc ... , it always produced a weak cup of coffee ... ever when using a much stronger blend.Bottom line is ... .if you 're trying to save money , someone is going to have to design a better filter , otherwise your going to be stuck with a product that 's going to cost you at least $ .60 + for a decent cup-of-joe and that was my primary motivation in the first place . That was to reduce the cost per serving . I was eventually convinced to return to my drip coffee maker to brew an affordable pot of coffee which I 'm fairly convinced is less expensive ( in the long run ) than one single cup of the & # 34 ; K & # 34 ; variety . Caveat Emptor ... .	-1
This is no better than just not using one . The thing blows out and still gets the grounds over the basket .	-1
I want to be environmental friendly when I purchased a Keurig brewer , so I also order this paper filter with refillable cup . It is too bad water just runs through this filter too fast , giving me a poor and weak tasting cup of coffee . The only way I can save this is by doubling up on the filters . I ca n't recommend this product and hopes I can find a better paper filter for Keurig .	-1
I have a reusable K-cup for my Keurig , I thought that this could be used with a disposable filter inside of that reusable cup to make clean up not existent . I was wrong . This lid goes with a plastic disposable cup so that you can build your own K-cup . Would have been helpful if that was in the description	-1
brittle does not seal at hole coffee comes out through top and all over your machine . Wish it worked better , dut hard on machine	-1
Decided to try these since they were a dollar cheaper than the ones I normally buy . They leak like crazy and stick in the coffee maker . I 'll go back to the ones I bought before .	-1
I have owned many electric blankets and mattress covers . I have had good luck with Sunbeam keeping me toasty . This blanket warms up to about a 1 ( 1-10 ) or Low heat setting , usually I like 7+ or high . The material is not what I would call modern fleece , maybe fleece from the 1970 's when it first came out . Worthy of a return .	-1
This electric blanket is ok if you are using on the bed between the sheets and cover ... But otherwise I would n't recommend it . I 've never felt the wires so clearly in an electric blanket before ! Definitely not cuddle-worthy ... but otherwise works as expected .	-1
I am going to return it . Far too hot and control setting give the same heat no matter what setting I use . The only way to control the heat is to turn it off . I placed a thermal probe under the comforter . The heated mattress pad is on the mattress , of course . Above the heated mattress pad , I have a thick mattress pad and on top of that , a fitted sheet . Next is a top sheet and on top of that is a thick comforter . So the probe is between the two sheets . On low setting the temperature is 104 degrees ( much too hot ) . On the highest setting , the temperature is 109 degrees . Add your own body heat and it becomes unbearably hot - that is , against the mattress pad . But on your top side , you will become too cold if the room temperature is in the mid to upper sixties . So there you are burning up on one side and freezing on the other. -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- Original review : It heats quite well , so I 'll just talk about the less than positive things . The heating lines are in a serpentine shape . You can easily feel the individual heating wires . However , after I put my mattress pad over the heated mattress pad , I could not feel the heating lines anymore . Then I put the fitted sheet over the mattress pad . It heats up quickly , so you do n't need to turn it on for very long before you go to bed.I put the control on the lowest heat and it is still too warm for me to use it while sleeping . I wish it had an even lower setting . One night I felt too hot on my back and too cold on my top side . So I had to add an additional blanket on top of me to stay warm . I think I should have purchased an electric blanket instead . I wish that there was more heat for my feet than for my torso.I do n't much like the location of the electrical connector . It is in the middle at the foot of the bed , but I doubt that I will be putting my feet there . It seems like they could have put it a little further down , however . After I inserted the blanket receptacle connector to the wires to the controller , I tried to remove the plug . But it is not at all easy , so I forgot about doing that . Once the plug is inserted , it certainly is n't coming out on its own . I wish the wires to the controllers were more flexible . The controllers definitely do n't stay on my night stands very well . They end up on the floor quite frequently . So now I put the controller under my pillow.Overall this is the best value I could find on Amazon , but I am not satisfied because the heating controls do n't work - same temperature no matter what the setting . Much too hot for comfort . Winters are short here in the Houston area , so I usually do n't need it to stay warm at night . I just use it to warm up the bed before I go to sleep . Then I turn it off .	-1
Not really happy with this . I guess I should have expected the quality being as how the price was so low . I 've purchased a very fine quality one through Costco at a high price and did n't know how different they can be . This Sunbeam has no padding and you can feel the wires when you lay on it . It warms fine but there should be enough padding surrounding the wires that you do n't feel them .	-1
The mattress pad arrived quickly , fit perfectly , set up easily . I plugged it in . It started flashing immediately . The controls were unresponsive , the `` instructions '' were useless , telling me to press the on/off button which did nothing . I tried unplugging then replugging everything , checking connections to make sure everything was as it should be . Nope.This is the second Sunbeam bedding product in a row that was broken on arrival or stopped working less than a month after purchase . The first was the electric blanket I bought for my granddaughter for Christmas and which stopped working in under three weeks . This was for my husband and I . When it became obvious it was not going to work , I called Amazon . They immediately sent return labels via email . I printed the labels , packed it up and it goes back via UPS tomorrow . Amazon is wonderful about returns . That is why I have a long-term relationship with them . They make me feel safe buying from them . They do n't hassle you , make it easy to return or replace items and go out of their way to make me feel like a valued customer . The problem is not Amazon . It is Sunbeam . There is a quality control issue with Sunbeam electric bedding products . I would suggest not purchasing these products until Sunbeam addresses the problems . Sunbeam used to be the best . I 'm very disappointed .	-1
Kudos to the genius who decided the best place for the electrical connection was dead smack on the top center of the mattress , versus on the side . My girlfriend and I greatly enjoy being able to snuggle up to the power connection together in the middle of the night . We tried it at the foot of the bed , but that just acts like piranhas eating your toes . Bed heats nicely , unfortunately the GD plug makes you want to strangle the inventor.Positives : 10 hour timer , dual controls look decentNegatives : Seriously , move the electrical connection to a SIDE . Throwing out after end of year .	-1
I am going to get new batteries today at Battery Joe 's - I think the problem is the cheap batteries I bought at Walmart - will try it and see .	-1
I saw this used and had to have it , but it was a disappointment in two ways . # 1 , if the avocado is n't at the exact perfect ripeness , the blades can create avocado mush instead of slices . # 2 , I do n't have a dishwasher , so washing between the little blades is a real pain . I tossed this out , because it 's just way easier to use a knife for the cuts , and a spoon to scoop it out .	-1
Love oxo products and in a moment of lazy weakness the idea of being able to slice avocados in the skin and scoop out was really appealing.The knife part ok but how many times are you preparing something and do n't have another knife at hand ... The insert to remove the seed I have found especially disappointing . Perhaps with a hard avocado , and thus up ripe , but if the avocado is soft at all = ripe ! then the pressure you would have to apply to get the tines to actually attach the seed end up just pushing the seed into the flesh and mash it . It can be somewhat useful to rotate the seed but that 's about it . This feature I have found a bit of a dud.The slicing feature ... one I was probably the most interested in . Works ok but ... the outer shape leaves quite a bit of flesh attached to the skin , not all avocados are this rounded or this size . And getting the flesh off the slicing blades does not work terribly well . The plastic of the blades and the configuration of them binds the slices so makes their separation anything but automatic.For a 10 kitchen gadget , and oxo , I expected more . I think this gadget will end up moving to the back of the drawer eventually ending up as a giveaway or yard sale item .	-1
Really not much of an improvement over a knife and spoon . Just another kitchen doodad that will migrate to the bottom of the draw and eventually be thrown away .	-1
OXO is such a good company for all kinds of well made kitchen gadgets and I was over the top about this avocado slicer . Upon the first one and two uses everything went smoothly ... . the end & # 34 ; knife & # 34 ; cuts the avocado nicely , the pit remover works nicely and the slicer end works great to slice and remove the fruit from the skin . I have not been hard on this gadget and I have washed it immediately after every use . I find that if this is done then it cleans much easier than leaving the avocado to sit and then be difficult to remove from between the slicer . Upon using about the third time I saw that one of the slicers had dislodged from the top end . It 's not completely broken off but only attached on one end . I 'm not sure how much more use it can take without coming off completely . Just know if you purchase this is a weak spot in this gadget . Therefore , because of this a rating of two stars and recommend with reservations ... . did not read other reviews to see if others having the same problem .	-1
First of all , the circular slicing wand on this tool is for use on a Hass Avocado ( those typically from California ) which are the smaller avocados with the pimply skin , softer flesh and higher fat content . The Florida Avocado is about 1-1/2 to 2 times larger , has smooth skin , firmer flesh and lower fat content . The Florida Avocado is the avocado you typically find in deli-purchased sandwiches due to its firmer flesh and larger circumference . Nevertheless , you will be unable to use the slicing wand on a Florida Avocado simply because it is bigger than the tool.Second , although the plastic knife and the center pit remover did its job very well ( better than I expected , in fact ) , this is nothing that ca n't be done with just a knife . Usually , I use a serrated knife to cut the Hass Avocado in half around the pit . I then give the pit a good wack with the serrated edge of the knife so that it lodges itself in the pit lengthwise . Then I wiggle the knife and pit from side to side , pull it out and discard the pit with a push of my thumb . I then peel the skin away usually in one piece from each half of the avocado , skim off any black spots with the knife and easily slice it in wedges with the same knife.Even though I knew a knife always worked well , a long time ago I made a spontaneous purchase of aProgressive International Avocado Slicerand a really nice avocado masher . I love the masher but was always sorry I purchased the avocado slicer because I found it to be overkill for slicing already soft avocados , some avocado always seems to be left behind , and sometimes some of the darkened flesh became mixed into the slices . Well with this OXO slicer , a lot of avocado is left behind and because the slicing tool is thick plastic , it smears the slices into clumps and some avocado clumps get stuck in the rungs between the tool . So it is even more disappointing than my Progressive Avocado Slicer.Therefore , although the slicing knife and pit remover enabled me to slice and pit the avocado nicely by pushing my finger through the hole to release the pit , I did not feel it was any better than a knife . Since the slicing wand turned the delicate avocado flesh into a mess with only a few good slices and missed a lot of flesh , this unit gets two stars . If the slicing wand were metal like my Progressive , I would have given it three stars only since then it would become a satisfactory and safer alternative for young adults to use without exposing them to the potential of cutting themselves on a knife.If I do use this tool in the future , it will be for the knife and pit remover portions only .	-1
This is bad . Just bad.I love OXO stuff . I have a lot of it . This is a disappointment.The cutter end works & # 34 ; OK & # 34 ; . Really no complaints there . I even liked it because I used it to slice hard boiled eggs.The pit puller ? Not so great . The hole in the back is genius and loveable . The blades do an OK job . But I find that they tend to strip that outer flesh off the pit and it sticks in the avocado . That does n't happen with my knife.Lastly , the & # 34 ; mush-maker & # 34 ; part . This is a joke . It is flimsy and unless your avocado is overly ripe it just makes a mess and is too hard to pull through.Sorry OXO . This one is a dud.Used two days and tossed out .	-1
well made and nice color but awkward to handleonly found I could use the knife portion of the device and really a regular knife does just as wellthe pitter portion of the device does n't really well and the slicer has limited use of range , the avocado has to be small to medium and many of the avocados I get are medium to largejust not really useful	-1
I tried this with a couple of different items : first , I blended rice flour , which is the holy grail , if you 're gluten-free ; then , I tried half a carrot , and got carrot pulp ; next up , leftover salad made with butter lettuce , tomatoes , cucumbers , and a tiny bit of carrot ; and finally , a cup of water and some sliced blanched almonds.My impressions were , in every case , that the particles produced after two or three minutes of blending , could not produce useable rice flour , carrot juice , green smoothies or almond milk.The particulate matter produced was so large that it would n't go down my kitchen drain without going through the disposal first . If you 're expecting a Vitamix , this is not that . If you want an expensive blender that can chew up carrots , make green smoothies , and process almond milk , you 'd be better off with another blender.Also , this is loud enough that it will make your ears ring after ten minutes.Finally , it 's really tall -- I had trouble fitting it under normal height kitchen cabinets .	-1
I do n't know if we got a defective one but I could n't open the compartment for the life of me . When I finally opened it , I closed it right away to see if I broke seal and that it will open easier but it did n't . If I could n't open it , there is not way my Kinder will be able to at school without help . Returned !	-1
mine did not work at all . awful and completely useless for a restaurant chef.Needs to plug into a MANUAL crockpot . do we live in the 80s ?	-1
Does not work as advertised . They say the temperature variance is +/- 0.2 degrees F when at set temperature , but it was actually 6 degrees ! ! Completely useless for cheese making . Also , during the heating process the temperature would fluctuate 4 degrees in either direction . Customer service is non-existent . They claim to respond to emails - they never did . I returned this.UPDATE : To be fair the company finally returned my emails , but I had returned it by then .	-1
I do n't know what & # 34 ; ... no-rust longevity ... & # 34 ; means exactly but as far as I am concerned , it means the item wo n't rust for about 6 months . I ordered this thinking it was different from the one I just threw away ( due to rust ) and low and behold when I opened the box , it was the exact same item . Not only that but it was about $ 15.00 that the one I bought in the store . Not too happy but it will do for now or at least the next 6 months .	-1
Did n't find this mit to be particularly comfortable to use . Prefer the fabric type . It worked fine of course , with no heat transfer , but I 'd prefer something more fashionable in the kitchen - and I 'm hardly an artist . Also , there is a particular noxious odor from the rubberized sufrace that is emitted from this glove when you use it to transport a hot object . I do not like this at all.Edit : I 'm changing the rating to one star . This mitt is tight fitting - I 've never had one as tight as this . Honestly , this mit is worse than even those free mitts you might 've got from a political campaigner giving them out with their name on it . This thing just sucks . I do not know how anyone could screw up an oven mitt but the deed is done .	-1
I had a beloved Cook Street butter boat I purchased on QVC years ago . Hubby broke the lid and I 've searched for over a year for a quality replacement . This Trudeau shares the same problem as the Silvermark butter boat . The quality is poor and the lid wobbles and does n't sit properly on the boat . Add to it that it 's made in China . Returned to Amazon for a refund .	-1
This bed is made excellent ( like sewing , stitching , etc . ) , but , it 's extremely hard . I read all the reviews on these beds by Lucid and decided on the 14 inch . Well ... it is not plush ! It 's hard ! ! ! I 've had it a week and barely have gotten any sleep on it . The last 2 days I 've gotten up with a backache . There is no way to get this bed back to a shipping state , so , I 'm stuck with it ... and very unhappy now . One person reviewed this bed saying it was like sleeping on a marshmallow . HA ! Maybe a stale one .	-1
I bought these because of good reviews . What a mistake ! They will not absorb water , and leave the dishes wet ! Do not buy ! !	-1
Made decent coffee , but machine parts come off machine easily . The lid has a hard time staying on pot , the top of machine door came off , and in all , it just was n't worth even it 's lower cost . This went to a thrift store . Also did n't pour well .	-1
Was encouraged by the amount of positive reviews this received , hoping I found an alternative to a $ 80 instant read . Was definitely too good to be true.It takes nearly 20 seconds to settle on a reading , even slower than the kitchen-timer probe thermometer I already have ! Defeats the entire purpose of an `` ultra-fast '' thermometer . Accuracy was also off in a boiling water test , although to be fair the packaging promises no better than +/- 3.6 degrees Fahrenheit.Back it goes .	-1
It is a small nice thermometer . The item in the picture on Amazon looks bigger , but it 's a small gadget , and tiny buttons . I did not want to spend $ 50-70 , but that was a mistake , get something better and you just buy it once . Not sure if I will use this for too long.As far as the seller , product was shipped promptly and arrived as expected .	-1
returned it , cheap fabric , is n't that cool . Do n't get me wrong , I 'm a HUGE Whovian , but do n't waste your money	-1
This was advertised for $ 199 , free shipping from July -30Nov 2013 . I purchased it and was charged $ 291.06 . When I contacted seller to refund the overcharge , the website was immediately changed and then the company responded by saying they never had it for $ 199 . All my Amazon links to the product in my order page also went to the $ 199 site . Until they changed it . Also , the unit was defective . I sent it back to manufacturer and they replaced it for me with kindness and professionalism beyond my expectations . They wondered why I had paid more for a refurbished one than a new one . Good luck .	-1
This machine is not for serious juicing . It gets heated up when juicing greens , and the pulp isstill pretty wet . It may be pretty easy to clean , but the plastic does stain , and is hard to keepclear . The blade gets gummed up with ginger , and it gets quite noisy at times . After using thismachine twice a day for 6 months I 'd like a refund . I already have to shop for a new juicer.Oh , and if you contact the company asking about BPA plastic , they never respond.Also using this type of juicer you are not getting high quality juice . You want a Masticatingjuicer . I purchased an Omega 8006 and I 'm quite happy with it .	-1
Like other `` Z by Malouf '' ( really ? Is this a genuine company ? ? ) products this is bottom of the barrel . Very cheap memory foam , very soft , not dense , wo n't last - kind of the Alzheimer 's of memory foam . If you want support while leaning your head back , i.e . something to fill the space behind your neck , this will NOT work . The foam is so soft it compresses very quickly without any resilience , so it provides almost zero support - Hey - that 's it ! Z ( is for Zero ) by Malouf ! By comparison , the TravelMate product is much more supportive .	-1
Not the sort of travel pillow I was seeking , which was more the conventional type . Saw conventional travel pillows with a snap closure on sale at ALDI for $ 6.99 and am VERY HAPPY with that pillow ! The Z Pillow is very `` smushy '' , a bit heavier than a conventional travel pillow , and does n't offer much support . It is too easily compressed , like gel infused memory foam that 's too easily compressed . And it 's a bit heavy . I found it slides out of position if I put it where I want it and actually fall asleep ... Then I awake with a stiff neck , which is what I bought this gizmo to prevent.It smells weird - kind of acrid chemical/flowery . Over a year later , a hint of the smell is still there.Why do I still have it if I do n't like it ? It 's been repurposed as a remote control corral at one end of our sofa . ( It may eventually go into a cat bed , since they like pillows and have lighter heads . )	-1
The design is very cute . There are several bare spots ( where there are no glaze ) on the inside and outside of the mug . Water , milk , coffee , or any liquid can get inside and eventually it will get moldy . This should not get out of the factory . I used it to store pencils .	-1
I got this pair of frying pans , or skillets . I 've been trying to find lids for them . No luck . I 've contacted T-Fal Customer Service and this is what I got back from them ; ( `` Our saute pans were designed as open saute pans . As such , they do not come equipped with lids nor do we have the lids available for purchase seperately.However , universal lids which may fit depending on the size of the pan are available from several retailers.They lids may be available at Kmart , Kohl 's , Bon-Ton Wal-Mart , Shopko , Target and Elderbeerman . `` ) I 've found and tried the T-fal `` Universal Lid '' and it does n't come close to fitting these . The handles are higher than the rim of the pan and that wont let the lid sit flat on the pan . I have 3 drawers full with over a dozen different sized lids and not a single one will fit either of these frying pans . Or as T-Fal insists on calling them `` Saute pans '' The only thing I can do to use them is us a piece of aluminum foil to cover it and that is barely more than nothing . So even though I 've had these for about 6 months I still have n't been able to use them.And I know it ai n't proper to write a review on something until it has been used . But I feel that the point that these do not have lids available for them needs to be posted . They are odd sizes and unlikely to have any other pans lid fit them . Since not having a lid available for it is pretty significant I feel that these only rate a 2 star evaluation . If they want a better rating , they need to make a lid for them , then I 'll change it .	-1
