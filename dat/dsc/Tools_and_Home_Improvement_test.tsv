We are in the midst of a never ending home remodel and , up to this point , we have used Hansgrohe fixtures throughout the house . Although they are very nice , Hansgrohe can be a little hard on the remodel budget . Hence we decided to take a gamble on this Premier faucet . The best points : - Nice finish that looks lie it will last ( and matches our new cabinet handles and light fixtures ) - A common 4 hole design that can easily transition to something else down the road if tastes change or performance suffers- Nice tall profile to allow for pots and pans in the sink- Solid feel and smooth lever actionWhat you do not get at this price point are the all metal components found in the workings of higher priced faucets . But once installed , the piece has a quality look and feel .	1
If this is the style that you are going for , you will not be disappointed in this faucet . It is relatively easy to install and the raised water channels make cleaning around the base pretty easy compared to other faucets . The finish on this is great and the handles work well and give the feel of good control . I always appreciated that in good faucets and this one is no exception . The box came with everything I needed to install and as long as you are comfortable with this type of install , it should go well ...	1
I just finished installing this Faucet in my kitchen and I love it . This faucet needs a three hole sink with another hole for the side spray . It took me about 2 hours to install it which included removing all the junk from under the sink , removing an old water filter ( good bye evil saddle valve ) and the old faucet . Using new threaded braided supply lines made installation go really smoothly . I love how it looks and think I will also enjoy the two handles as opposed to my old singe handled faucet . My kitchen looks a lot nicer now.I recommend this faucet for looks and ease of installation . Nothing to be afraid of.Installation Notes : - You will need to get two water supply lines , or reuse the old ones if possible . They are not included . I removed my copper lines and replaced them with two 3/8 '' to 1/2 '' 20 inch braided supply lines from the big orange home supply store . Six bucks each . Just tighten with a wrench.- I had to drill an inch and quarter hole in the sink for the sprayer . I already had a small hole on the left for the filtered water , so I used that and got rid of the water filter . I used a Milwaukee Bi-Metal Hole Saw that attaches to your power drill as a drill bit . Eleven Bucks same store.- The sprayer hose snaps onto the bottom of the faucet in the middle hole . The hose was coiled pretty tightly . I found that running hot water through it and then unwinding it kept it straight so it goes in and out of it 's holder nicely .	1
During the course of updating our kitchen , we wished to introduce a little classical style and warmth to what is otherwise a pretty spartan part of the room . When it came to choosing a new faucet , we considered a lot of factors before selecting the Premier Charlestown Two-Handle Bridge Style Faucet for our home . The success criteria was pretty simple : classic style , superior cnstruction , highly durable finish , simple and logical controls , and a relatively simple installation process . ( The last factor was critical - we 've regretted not considering installation when purchasing plumbing fixtures and we were determined to reduce the stress factor this time around - and I 'm happy to report this faucet installation took less than an hour ) .All in all , we 're absolutely delighted with our new Premier Charlestown Faucet . It looks awesome ( better than the majority of the more expensive models we looked at ) , and the operation is as smooth as silk . Oh , and we also appreciated the low price.This was a five-star product , from quality to value .	1
Often pictures can be deceiving , in this case I was not sure whether the faucet would actually look like similar to the product pictured here . Well , to my surprise , it was pretty much the mirror image of what you see here on amazon . A very nice Bronze look accompanies this Victorian-era design . The unit is n't very heavy but substantial enough to feel confident that it 's a quality product . My one problem is that one of the levers seems off center , hence the four star review . A minor problem but one that some undoubtedly wo n't be able to overlook given the price-point of this product .	1
Three convenient ways to access entry into our business - via key , entering assigned code into keypad or by remote control . We have been able to unlock our car doors with remote controls for a long time now , so it is about time we can do it with our doors at home or businesses . We installed the SimpliciKey Remote Control Electronic Deadbolt Lock to the front entrance door of our automotive service garage . Keep in mind this lock does NOT come with a knob or handle to open the door.It was simple to install , just make sure the deadbolt barrel goes into the strike plate hole perfectly . Since it was already replacing a previous deadbolt that was already in place , it only took minutes to install . This is not our first time using a keyless entry lock , we have been using another well known brand at our home for years and have been very pleased.I really like how the numeric keypad is hidden with the slide down panel/door , it makes it look like just any other ordinary deadbolt . Now we can control which employees have access to go in and out when we are not open for business or the big `` Kahuna '' is not there.UPDATE 04/02/13 : In regards to battery life , we have had the SimpliciKey Lock installed now for almost over 3 months and we just changed the batteries . It started chirping and flashing . We did not use cheap batteries either . So battery life is not all that great but we still really enjoy using this lock and are extremely pleased with it .	1
I 'd always wanted to try an electronic lock , because , unfortunately , I 've locked myself out of my house a time or two . So when I recently got a brand new high-security back door , I thought it was the perfect time to give this lock a try . The installation was easy . The instructions for install and operation were detailed and easy to understand . The lock fit through the standard deadbolt hole that had been cut into the door , so we did n't even have to cut a new hole . We really had no problems at all with installing this lock.Operation is simple and straight forward . I will say though that I do have a bit of a problem getting the lock to unlock . Locking works fine every time , but for some reason , when unlocking , half the time I get an error , and have to try again . A second try usually works , but that 's a bit of and inconvenience . Not sure if that is a problem with the lock itself or the install.The remote key fobs worked great ... for a few days . Other reviewers here are right in complaining that the key fob batteries do n't last . Could be because these units have been sitting around for too long before being purchased , and the batteries just wore down , or they are just using cheap batteries . An install of fresh batteries seems to solve that problem.Overall , I love the lock and despite some minor inconveniences it seems to work well so far .	1
I 've been looking to replace our old front door lock with a newer , higher-tech model , and the SimpliciKey SRCED-SN-2 Remote Control Electronic Deadbolt Door Lock looked to be a perfect fit.I read the other user reviews and liked the fact that it seemed you could install it in less than an hour . Considering myself a mid-level DIY-er , I accepted the challenge , only to discover that , upon removing the old deadbolt , the holes in the door for the interior lock component and the latch were smaller than the 2 1/8 '' and 1 '' diameters required ( something you really would n't be able to determine until you removed the old components ) .Not owning a 2 1/2 '' hole saw required to expand the cutout , I had to put the old deadbolt back in ( no easy task ) , so I had pretty much spent an entire hour with nothing to show for it.But that 's my door 's problem , not any beef I have with SimpliciKey . After calling in an expert with the right tools , the lock was soon installed and I 'm very happy with it.Never thought how convenient having a remote control key fob to open the door would be , until I was carrying a bunch of groceries and realized I would n't have to first put them down , then fumble in my pocket for the key . Or how much easier it would be to give our housekeeper her own private code that she could punch in to open and lock the door , rather than have to remember to leave her the key.As for comments about it being a battery eater . We took the advice of those saying to use premium AA alkalines ( four of them are required ) and , considering we often enter the house through the garage rather than the front door , we have n't noticed a problem with battery consumption .	1
UPDATE 4-1-2013Last week , I discovered to my horror that this unit be unlocked simply by pressing the unlock button on the keypad . I fired off a bulletin to the manufacturer and while waiting for a response , took the unit apart and discovered that I had not assembled it correctly in the first place . I now realize that the flat `` pin '' must be inserted in a HORIZONTAL position not vertical ( unless your door is hung the opposite way ) This solved the problem and now I can use the one key to lock the door on the way out ! Also , in my original review , I had doubts about the quality of the silicon touchpaper , thinking it would suffer premature wear ... well , I am wrong , it still looks like new ! I replaced the batteries at about three months use only because I managed to get my hands on a set of Lithium Iron batteries a a great price.Today , Devell , a customer service agent with Simplicity called me to alert me to my problem , I explained that I had already discovered my error . He asked if I had any other questions , and as I am already aware , recommended a GOOD set of batteries . He pointed out that cold weather will not affect the life of the batteries because they are on the inside of the door by design thus not exposed to frigid elements of the north American winter.I maintain my 4 stars for this product and am quite satisfied overall ! This is simple to install and set up if you CLOSELY follow the instructions and your door is properly aligned . i.e . it must open and close without pushing it or lifting it . While waiting for this to arrive , I noticed that our door was slightly out of alignment and I fixed it before this device arrived.Overall , I am impressed with the design and build quality except for the silicon keypad which it a bit on the cheap side and unfortunately , will show wear on the keys selected to lock and unlock the door ( though the order of keys will not be evident of course ) The instructions recommend using quality batteries in this device and I agree , I have some expensive batteries in it that I hope will last a while ... but if you buy cheapo batteries from a bargain store do n't complain when you need to replace them in less than two weeks . This device pulls a lot of power to perform its work and with the lights and sounds , it needs a decent set of batteries.The two remote controls work very well , the keypad is very responsive and the physical key works smoothly too ! I will need to buy spare remotes but asides form that I am very pleased.This is a decent remote lock with three options to lock and unlock your door ! For the price I think it is worth the convenience !	1
This really is a do it yourself item ! I 'm not mechanically inclined by any means but I was able to install , program , and use the SimpliciKey set all by myself . I felt the instructions were self explanatory and easy to understand . I 'm not really sure why other reviewers have rated this so low . I 'm really enjoying this set and have had no issues what so ever after following the instructions . Overall it is attractive , durable , safe , and user friendly .	1
This remote control electronic deadbolt door lock in satin nickel is a very handsome looking lock for any exterior door . It is a heavy-duty piece of hardware . I am pleased with it .	1
This is not my first electronic door deadbolt door lock . I also have a Shlage electronic door lock that this lock has replaced on the front door , whilst the Shlage has been moved to the garage side door.First of all , this is an attractive design that has a keypad hidden behind a sliding panel . The idea is that you use the key fobs much like you would on a modern car to lock and unlock the doors . As a backup you can still use a key.This lock only has a mechanical handle on the inside and just the lock cylinder outside . So you will need another handle to actually pull the door shut when you leave.It is an attractive design that is well thought out . It has a hidden illuminated keypad if you want to use a combination on the number pad to activate the lock . And the inside has a similar hidden panel where four AA batteries fit to power the unit . This makes it very easy to install new batteries without having to undo screws to get the back off like our other lock does . So a well thought out design.NOTE : Batteries are not included with the lock . So you will have to get some of your own.The lock was easy to install . No extra holes were required on either door I tested on.Instructions are clear and legible.On powering up the unit for the first time , the lock automatically checks whether the door is a left or right handed one and the keyfobs work straight away . All that is left is to program your combinations numbers.Initial impressions : The lock looks very nice but in operation I did have a slight problem . The front door and closes about inch off of the frame . The lock is a powered deadbolt and four AA batteries mean it does n't have a very strong motor driving the bolt . So the friction makes it jam and sound an alarm.I managed to fix this by adjusting the bottom door handle latch plate so the bottom latch would hold the door flush to the frame and now the lock now works perfectly.I really like this lock . It is a little more convenient than the Shlage unit that operates differently . The Simplicikey is a powered bolt whereas the Schlage is not . It simply activates a clutch that engages or disengages the door knob handle on the outside so when locked , the door handle spins freely . You activate the deadbolt manually on the Shlage unit after typing in the combination which engages the handle . The other nice feature is that the number pad being hidden is very nice and clean if you do n't use it often but inconvenient if you do.One other thing worth mentioning is that this lock claims to be bump key resistant . So that hopefully offers some extra security there .	1
The SimpliciKey was installed and operating smoothly within 30 minutes of arrival . As a woman who excelled at shop classes in school , I 've always been handy with tools and know my way around a hardware store . For me , this lock was easy to install without any modifications to my door whatsoever . My task so made so easy by the fact I had my front door replaced not terribly long ago ; since my door was professionally installed rather recently everything lined up perfectly.Installation Suggestions : * USE HIGH QUALITY AA BATTERIES - FOUR OF THEM . SimpiciKey will consume cheap batteries . * Prior to purchase evaluate your door for proper alignment which will make a tremendous difference in ease of install - if your existing system has issues and if you are not quite as handy , consider professional installation . * Consider using this lock in a door that is used less frequently unless you are comfortable replacing the 4 AA batteries rather frequently . In my case this lock will be moving to a back door in the not so distant future when I can afford the next generation of Nexia z-wave deadbolt ( the current generation does not allow remote locking , only remote unlocking . ) *THOROUGHLY read the included manual , first and foremost , BEFORE beginning the installation process . I suspect this helped to make my installation such a smooth process . * Do not install the wood screw in the top of this unit - if you just use the 2 metal screws in the primary back plate you will prevent yourself having an unsightly problem if you decide to change locks again at a later date . * The small white wire is very difficult to connect . I found it was easier to align the white wire 's tiny odd connector then sort of `` rotate '' the connector with my thumb until it finally clicked into place . ( Note to manufacturer : Please use a different connector , the current tiny gold connector can be a real pain to connect for someone with hand issues or impaired vision ! ) * It may help to have an extra pair of hands or in my case I have a nearby shelf on which to set all the extra screws , screw drivers , and spare parts within easy reach . A tool and parts pouch ( usually canvas ) would help , too , though I prefer them being visible on the shelf instead of digging around in a pouch.According to the packaging : * Additional keyfobs can be ordered separately , up to 8 can work with this unit at any given time . * Up to 16 distinct key codes can be programmed at any given time.Features : * Backlit alpha numeric keypad . * High Intensity Blue LED confirms action ( VERY BRIGHT ! ) * Bump-resistant 6-pin keyway* Heavy Duty all-metal construction ( explains price tag ... ) * 4AA Battery compartment ( restricted to inside access only - accessible by sliding heavy duty metal cover off unit ) * Battery Low Indicator - Orange LED on interior side of lock* full 1 '' deadbolt extension* ANSI Grade 2* BHMA CertifiedThe well-documented manual included with this lock included the following directions to add or delete keyfobs or key codes including the master ADMIN code . In the following directions , the ADMIN Code is the unique code on the back of the manual . I generally always email these numbers to a special email address / file in case I can not locate the manual ( s ) when needed . This 7 digit code can be changed to a 4 to 6 digit code , directions below under `` Keypad '' .Keyfobs : * To Add a Keyfob : Enter ADMIN CODE * , A-D-D-F-O-B-* ( 233362* ) then press and hold BOTH keyfob buttons . Test keyfob . * To Delete a Keyfob : Enter ADMIN CODE * , D-E-L-F-O-B-* ( 335362* ) then press and hold EITHER keyfob button . Test keyfob . * To Delete ALL keyfobs : Enter ADMIN CODE * , D-E-L-F-O-B-S-* ( 3353627* ) , repeat D-E-L-F-O-B-S-* ( 3353627* ) . Test keyfobs.Keypad : * Add Key Code : Enter ADMIN CODE * , A-D-D-C-O-D-E-* ( 2332633* ) , enter New Key Code * , Repeat New Key Code * . Test keycode then lock/unlock button . * Delete Key Code : Enter ADMIN CODE * , D-E-L-C-O-D-E-* ( 3352633* ) , enter Key Code to Delete * , Repeat Key Code to Delete * . Test deleted keycode then lock/unlock button . * Delete ALL Key Codes : Enter ADMIN CODE * , D-L-C-O-D-E-S-* ( 3526337* ) , repeat D-L-C-O-D-E-S-* ( 3526337* ) . Test deleted keycodes , each with lock/unlock button . * Simple Lock Feature : Enables unit to be locked from keypad without code : press lock button , enter ADMIN CODE * , L-O-C-K-* then 1* , 1* to turn ON or 2* , 2* to turn OFF . * Quiet Lock Feature : Keypad sounds on/off : Enter ADMIN CODE * , S-O-U-N-D-S-* ( 76863* ) , Sounds ON press 1* , 1* or Sounds OFF press 2* , 2* . * MASTER RESET : Press and hold ANY button while installing 4th battery . * TO CHANGE ADMIN CODE : Enter CURRENT ADMIN CODE * , A-D-M-I-N-* ( 23646* ) , enter 4-6 digit NEW ADMIN CODE * , Repeat NEW ADMIN CODE * , await confirmation tone then will flash twice to confirm . Otherwise start over . KEEP THIS NEW CODE SAFE ! I am satisfied with this lock . I appreciate the fact the 4 AA batteries can be replaced without any tools , simply slide the back cover up and off to replace the batteries , similar to how the front cover slides up to reveal the numeric keypad . The price seems a tad bit high but is very much in line for such a well-made high quality product . I will update my review if some unforeseen problem develops . SimpliciKey 's customer service can be reached at 800-785-6595 .	1
I really like having a keyless deadbolt . It 's come in handy when we 've had guests in our house ; they do n't need a key & we can program a number that is easy for THEM to remember & then change it after they leave . You can also just hand them a fob if they are good at NOT losing things.It 's a nice looking unit & still looks new after 6 months . Install was not terribly hard but we had installed a keyless entry prior to this one so we knew what we were in for . You do need some skills to make sure your strike plate is adjusted properly and if your cutouts are less than 2-1/8 '' , you will need to remove your door to expand the cutout . This will also require you have a hole saw . We did not have this problem so the install was fairly easy.This unit does not go through batteries any faster than the other Schlage unit we own . It takes 4 AA batteries & you will need to replace them annually - more often if the door gets used a lot.The fobs are a good size - not too big or too small . They have 2 big red buttons ; one for locking & one for unlocking . Also can be put on your keychain . We rarely use the fobs since we find it easy to just enter our code & it 's one less thing to carry .	1
The SimpliciKey SRCED-SN-2 Remote Control Electronic Deadbolt Door Lock is one of those things you never knew you needed until you had it . The convince of not having to fumble for my keys while both arms are full of groceries or something else is hard to over state . I ca n't speak to the ease or difficulty of installation since that was done by a local handyman . I can say the job seemed to go along without a hitch and he said nothing to me that would indicate he found the job to be difficult or otherwise unpleasant.The unit comes with two key fobs that claim a 50-foot range . In my tests around the yard that seems to be about right , although If you are inside your car that range is reduced by about half . The unit also has a covered , backlit , keyboard that allows 4-6 digit code to be used to open the lock . This is great for visitors and others who need temporary access . Later ( if you want ) you can change the code.The unit takes 4-AA batteries . It has a heavy well-built feel to it and so-far has worked without a hitch . For the old fashioned at home ( or in the case of a malfunction ) the package comes with two keys . The SimpliciKey SRCED-SN-2 looks great , works like it 's meant to and offers plenty of options for securing your doors . I would recommend it highly .	1
Installation took about 20 minutes when replacing an existing Titan lock ( not automatic ) . Removed the old lock , installed the Simplicikey and installed its batteries.The instructions are very weak - entire parts are missing like a good diagram of which screws to use and how to best install the deadbolt . There are also several additional pieces of paper included which could have all been inside the main manual . For a lock like this , color pictures would have been a great improvement.Once the lock was installed , I installed the new strikeplate and realized the deadbolt did n't fit it . I then spent the next ten minutes making adjustments to it and moving it forward a little to fit the deadbolt . Kind of odd as my previous two locks perfectly fit in the existing strikeplate . Also , the included plate is quite small , leaving a large gap around my previous hardware . A coverplate for the strikeplate is also included , but this means you may need to make the strikeplate groove in your door a little deeper.Programming was easy , but this is where the manual misses one important thing - code 000000 is pre-programmed , and you must manually delete it . No idea how many Simplicikey owners out there have a front door that 'll let people in using code 000000.The included keyfobs are pre-programmed to the lock and have a decent range . There is also an antenna on the outside unit , so i 'll pick up the remotes from inside your car.The hardware feels sturdy , but it is a disappointment that good hardware is spoiled by lousy instructions . The vendor really needs to improve this . Still , a motorized deadbolt wireless remote lock for this price is a good deal.Of course , this review only focuses on a short time using the lock , so I 'll continue to update as I keep using it .	1
I 've been wanting a deadbolt set for a long time . I was happy to get this and the car key controls come in handy , especially when you are holding groceries . It 's nice to not have to fumble with my keys to unlock my door . This is fairly easy to install , but , I do agree with other reviewers that your door needs to be nearly perfect for it to install correctly . It 's also a nice looking lock with the satin nickel finish . I 'd recommend for someone wanting a nice deadbolt .	1
A remote control lock for your house door is an interesting idea , but I do not know how reliable it is . After reading some reviews that said it did not work or glitched out , I decided to put it on my back door , instead of my front , because that is a big security risk . I have had it on there for a couple of weeks , and it has been working fine so far . The installation was not difficult either . I hope to move it to my front door eventually , so that I can get in and out easier with groceries and things . I can see why having an automatic door lock would be very convenient .	1
First things first , I am exceedingly pleased with this lock . I 'll go into its features in a moment , but I wanted to get installation discussed first , as this was something that I found intimidating at first . It is n't really that hard to do , but does require a little time and some faith that you can do it ! If I can do it , you can do it.I am sure that this will come as no surprise to anyone , but you are going to need some tools to install this lock -- you will at least need a screwdriver and a little know how to remove your old lock if you have one . We installed this one in a door that did not previously have a deadbolt , so it was a little more complicated for us . I had to buy a chisel ( to chisel out a receiver space for the locking bolt ) , and I had to buy a hole saw ( it is an attachment for your drill ) to drill out a hole for the lock itself in our door . Because our door has a metal lining , we had to get one that would cut metal . There is a template included in the lock that shows you where and how to make the hole in your door , and where and how to make the receiver hole . Once the hole in the door was drilled out , the lock went in easily ; the screw holes in the two halves of the lock were not perfectly aligned , but with a little jiggling , we were able to get them lined up well enough to screw the lock in securely . We had a few problems as well with perfect alignment of the dress plate ( the shiny metal plate that covers the edges of the receiving hole ) , but we used a Dremel tool to file this out perfectly so that the bolt would slide smoothly . I am not a handyman by any stretch of the imagination , and I was able to do this , so if this sounds at all concerning , take a deep breath and know that you can do it . It is entirely possible that the minor difficulties I had were due to my own imperfect installation skills . None of these things would likely have been a problem if I had been inserting this lock into a door that already had the holes drilled out , so if you are just changing the lock , this will likely be easier . Even with the extra steps I had to do , this was all accomplished in about an hour.The lock is big and clunky , very satisfyingly solid . When the bolt slides home in your door , it feels very secrure . I like that . The locking mechanism is easy to turn , and easy to tell when it is completely extended . The lock comes with two keys , which fit perfectly for us and turn the lock smoothly and easily . Of course , the big features of this lock set are the electronic capabilities . I am happy to report that these work smoothly also , and are very easy to use . The set comes with two key fobs that look kind of like car locking mechanisms on your car remote -- just a lock and unlock button . Easy . You can also program your keypad with a 6 digit code to lock and unlock your door ; the code is programmable with a multistep process that requires a `` master '' code included in your instruction book , so do n't lose this documentation . The process for programming is about 4 steps , and is not difficult but may require a little pre-reading to get everything right , because you have a limited time to complete the full operation . I succeeded in programming everything on my second try . Total process took about 4 minutes from start to finish with instruction reading/false start/final success . Optionally , you can also program the lock to lock itself with a single touch of a lock button . I think that this is an excellent feature , and while it is not defaulted , it is easy to turn on . The keypad is sturdy feeling , lights up when you use it ( great if you are in the dark ) , and is easy to see and feel.I am absolutely delighted with this lock . I now wo n't worry if I lose my keys ( I can just use the keypad ! ) and I feel a little more secure with this deadbolt on a door that previously did n't have one .	1
I 'm very impressed with everything about this lock . It 's attractive . It only took an hour to install . The keypad works quickly and is nicely illuminated . The key fob remote works twenty feet away . I do n't like extra things on my keychain so I use the keypad ... my wife likes the remote . We 're both happy . Highly recommended .	1
My husband installed the lock as a replacement lock for the backyard door . He said that it was a little hard to install as it took over 2 hours to get it done . Once finished , it works great.He complained about the lack of instructions , he wanted a lot more instructions something like a manual , even if it was online , would have been nice to have.To his surprise the strike plate fitted nicely replacing the old one.Overall this is a good lock that has simplified our lives by not having to take keys when walking the dog or simply taking a walk around the neighborhood .	1
Had this bit a little over a week and drilled a total of approximately a dozen holes for the new Kreg HD screws . No heavy use here , I 'm a DIY'er doing little projects around the house . The project currently underway is a deck extension to our limited original builder 's deck that needed a little touch up . Today , on my second hole on the end of a diagonal bracing 2 x 4 for the deck extension the pre-drill pilot section suddenly broke off . My guess is that Kreg Tool has contracted with a supplier that is using lower quality steel . I have a request in with the Amazon Seller to return this as defective , we 'll see how that goes . SEE PHOTO.UPDATE : Seller Hartville Tool passed the ball to Kreg Tool . By that I mean they told me to contact Kreg directly for a replacement . Sent an email and forwarded their instructions to Kreg Tool . No word yet.UPDATE : Kreg Tool is sending a replacement and is checking into the issue.Let me say that I think Kreg Tool offers great product with exceptional design to function fulfillment . ALL issues I 've encountered are limited to the metal used in production undermining an otherwise great product.UPDATE : Replacement holding up well .	1
I wish this was available with a 3/8 & # 34 ; shank instead of a 1/4 & # 34 ; hex drive . The one I bought was to replace one that bent ( at the hex drive end ) when I dropped my drill .	1
I bought the Kreg HD set to make a loft bed for my grandson - about 90 pocket holes or so . I had just finished all the pocket holes when the bit 's tip broke ! I 'm not new to woodworking or Kreg jigs , and have used the smaller one for years with no trouble so I was surprised , but it was apparently a fluke . I contacted the seller , they immediately replaced it at no charge ( and did n't ask for the broken one back ) , so kudos to them for very fast , friendly and responsive customer service.I 've used it some more with no issues , and the bed I built is incredibly strong with the HD jig system.Overall very happy - especially with the seller .	1
Using this for a New 300 ' Privacy Fence we are building . It is working as expected so far . Well made & durable . I also have other Kreg tools.Can get a little clogged up though requiring tapping to remove shavings.Still using first bit after hundreds of holes . I am very careful though making sure I do n't force the bit at all .	1
This is a nice bit for the HD Kreg system . I 'm a big fan of the Kreg pocket hole system , and have used it for both cabinetmaking and rough work with 2x4s.Something to know is that this is just like any drill bit , it will dull over time , and also the tip can break . So expect to buy new ones from time to time . It 's hard to say exactly , but I 've been buying the HD screws in packs of 100 , and it 's probably fair to say that a bit lasts for approx 200 screws in white pine or pressure treated pine.The Kreg system only works with this bit , so I have started to always have one extra bit before planning a day or with with the Kreg jigs .	1
these are strong the magnet is great the machining is good . they sing the screw just enough for a good countersink.Have n't stripped one yet in my impact . That 's good ! Thanks , Eric	1
This Hitachi No.2 Square Magnetic Driver Bit is a very good product ( if you find proper screw at your local hardware store ) I try and I 'm very pleased with my purchase .	1
The only magnetic square drive I have seen and makes a bid difference under the right situation . For little more money it sure beats the standard , non magnetic , bits .	1
Wonderful to use . The magnets work great and the bits bite just as they should . I wish they had a full line of magnetic tipped bits , I 'd buy the whole set .	1
These are great . I ordered the phillips head ones first by mistake but those are great too . Now I wish they made a star drive one .	1
Great quality metal ( made in JPN , not PRC ) plus magnetic tip as well as great design make up a great product	1
These mini lanterns were perfect for our patio . We added them across the seating area of the patio and strung frosted lights around the perimeter . Perfect for night entertaining .	1
These are exactly the lights I was looking for for my small back yard . They all worked when I hung them up but you ca n't connect more than 5 sets ( the box says 7 sets ) or they wo n't work . I 've had them a few weeks and a couple lights blew out but overall I like them and will probably order a few more sets to go completely around my fencing . The material is some kind of nylon so it holds up in the rain .	1
They look nearly white in the daylight but have that nice tan/papyrus color at night ( very much like the picture ) .	1
hello , this packaging was a great deal as the lamps look and fit in the right place for us . they look like larger round xmas lights . we needed mood lighting during the season and so far , they fit the bill . they come in a compact container , but will stretch out . the bulbs are well protected and should last for many seasons . we kept the box for storage to protect the artificial & # 34 ; paper : & # 34 ; balls . the & # 34 ; paper & # 34 ; should not get crushed if you just throw them into the big box of rolled up xmas lights , but the provided box will be better protection . great product , great delivery ...	1
These are nice lights but they are not very bright so if you intend to use them for anything other then ambiance lighting , you 'll need a lot of them .	1
I would have given these 5 stars if they hung straight down . Sadly , a disadvantage of the lightweight design is that they will face any direction the wire is facing . You can not get them all to hang straight down ( as would be desired for the best look ) without adding a weight to them . As I did not want to do that , mine are wanky ( though still cute ) .	1
I do a bit of wood work here and there and recently a friend of mine commissioned me to build him a custom TV stand and some DVD/BD racks . These little guys work pretty well with wood glue but quite a bit of it builds up in the bristles after a little bit of application . The great thing about these brushes is that once the glue has dried , it is n't too difficult getting the dried adhesive off .	1
Much better then using acid brushes , Easy to clean , works great . Who could ant more I now have 4 brushs	1
At first I was doubtful about how well these would work but I have to say that after trying them they are great . Cleanup is a snap , just let the glue dry and peal it off .	1
These have worked well . Glue just peels off . Sometimes it is thick so I take it easy on the peeling . Do n't know if the finger would pull off but peeling carefully has kept the brush in good shape . Use to use the small disposable brushes but feel better about reusing this type of brush . I use to feel a bit guilty about throwing away a brush after a small glue job so this works for me .	1
Just bought these a month ago , and have been using them to glue rabbeted corners on plywood . The glue-spread is excellent and the silicone bristles are soft yet durably secured to the brush . After spreading I just set them down for an hour , then run tap water over them and pull out all the stuck wood glue and they 're good to go again . The heads are removable , but I 've yet to see replacement heads for sale - I 've not needed them , but it would be nice . Only downside is occasionally I pick one up thinking it 's dry , and start to peel glue when some fresh , undried glue that was somehow sealed inside the bristles pops out and makes cleaning a bit more of a chore . Also , they could be cheaper , but you definitely get what you pay for . Recommended	1
Spreading glue has never been easier and clean up is slick as a whistle ! Let the glue dry and then peel it off.. When these wear out I will be ordering more for sure	1
You pretty much ca n't pass these up.If you do n't loose them they should last a long time . I wish I thought of this . Actually I wish I had invented the internet ... ... ... ... ..	1
I purchased one of these from Rockler over a year ago . This simple tool has changed by gluing habits . It lets me put down just the right amount of blue with minimal squeeze out . Clean up is a breeze as glue does not adhere to the silicone . I had used the small brushes for years . These glue brushes are far superior . Every shop should have one .	1
Not really sure what all to say ... Two brushes , they spread the glue out , and the glue peals off the brush nicely ! !	1
no need for quick cleanup after use as dried glue removes easily from bristles , just do n't pull too roughly on dried glue as bristles will break from body . Finesse not muscle , and brush is good as new .	1
So much better than the random brushes , napkins , and pieces of cardboard I was using . Do n't know how I worked without these . I love having two so that while one dries I can use the other for different projects .	1
The brush works great to get even coverage and the dried glue just peels right off the material so cleanup is as easy as throwing the brush in a jar until it dries . The flat end is great for getting inside dovetails or other smaller spaces and helps get a nice even coverage . I bought this and the Push-Bloc . Both of these purchases have converted me to looking at other handy tools that BenchDog has . If you are working with glue these are a cheap and great tool to have around .	1
These are great for applying glue , and are very easy to clean up after the glue dries on them.I initially tried using acid brushes to apply glue , but those are tedious and not very good , and just get thrown away.The Bench Dog brushes work better at spreading the glue , and once the glue dries on them , it peels right off.Works great with Titebond wood glues .	1
Well made and same as other popular woodworking product except for color . Easy to remove dried glue and makes it easy to spread glue on wide or narrow surfaces .	1
I have been using these for over 4 months now in my woodworking projects and they 've made life a lot easier . Glue is spread evenly on the wood with soft bristles so that little ridges are formed which allows even spread when you press two surfaces together . But the best part is the cleanup . You just let the glue dry on the brushes and peel it off afterwards and the brushes are good to go again . Wish I had found these things sooner .	1
An excellent idea , well done . When using glue everyone 's instructions say to apply a thin , even coat - but nobody tells you how . I 've been using scrap material ( wasteful ) or napkins ( take up a lot of the glue ) to move the glue around with spotty results.The silicone material wo n't stick to the epoxy and PVA glues I 've used . Simply wait until the glue dries , and peel it off the brush or spade end .	1
I always wanted these glue brushes . They really are awesome . I purposely glued up a project and let the glue dry in them . The trick is to wiggle them back and forth after the glue dries to pop the dried glue loose . Works like a champ ! No more ruined brushes .	1
I have used these and the similar Rockler silicone glue brushes for the better part of a year , and they 're terrific for the popular polymer glues like aliphatic resins ( e.g. , yellow carpenter glue like Titebond ) and polyurethanes ( e.g. , Gorilla glue ) . These glues will not stick to the bristles ! So far as I can determine , the main difference between the Rockler and Bench Dog brushes is the color.That said , these brushes are really best for cruder applications where one is n't trying for a perfect glue line with minimal squeezeout as it is difficult to control the `` spread '' with the coarse silicon bristles . Also , the small surface area of the brush discourages its use for gluing larger areas . For more precise gluing or gluing of large areas , I still prefer disposable white china brushes . However , for a quick glue-up these brushes are hard to beat .	1
Your usual Bosch high quality product.A very good price too . Should last a long long time if not abused	1
i got this for some projecting , its a very nice blade make a super clean cut . I would highly recommend .	1
My illness requires many changes in my life , but I refuse to give up woodworking . Now trapped in an apartment with no shop or garage I have had to give up my table saw . This blade , added to my new Skill saw and Contractor clamp , makes clean cuts in sheet goods , and the whole setup is portable , easy to store . A decent blade is essential to clean cuts , especially in plywood . This one meets the challenge . The price was fair and I love the results . I will soon be investing in a 7 1/4 sliding miter saw . I will add another of these blades to it . Doing a good job requires taking ones time . Do n't rush the cut , and you 'll regain time through reduced sanding and improved joints .	1
My father 's saw had a carbide blade from the early 90 's and it has seen lots of use . Needless to say blade design has improved since then . I got one of these in place of a Freud due to lower cost yet this is still a Bosch , which typically that company makes high-price high-end products . This cuts smoother than the old 40t blade , in fact when you get one of these make a good straight cut . The wood feels like it was sanded smooth . Very clean cutting . After a few weeks of use on 4 projects the white and red paint is coming off but the blue 'anti-friction ' finish is not , which surprised me as I thought it was just fancy wording for paint . It still might come off in due time though .	1
Very satisfied with this blade . I only use this blade on my small miter saw . The last one lasted about four years . I hit a sheet rock screw on an old board .	1
A ideal and useful component of the cordless circular saw I recently bought to carry away into the field where you can not always find a current bush .	1
Well made , awesome saw blade , great deal , taking care the job perfectly . Thanks Bosch . Keep up good work , home builder ca n't build home without you ... ...	1
Love these for the price but not quite as tough as other brands I 've used . I 'm forced to sacrifice a blade every so often so these are great on the spot back-ups . Good as the & # 34 ; git-er done & # 34 ; blade but not exceptional in most ways .	1
This is a good blade , cut many a sticks in many a remodel job with the one blade on my Kobalt cordless so far .	1
Use this on my Bosch cordless saw , very satisfied with this blade . I only use these blades on new wood or new plywood so I do n't know how it would handle nails or cement .	1
I really love this flashlight . I 'm not sure its current anymore and commonly available , but I bought one when it was on sale for $ 39 . What a great deal , this flashlight is perfect ! AA batteries but LARGE and easily grippable . Love the shape of the handle , it is wornderful to hold onto . I like that the button is at the end of it instead of on barrel , makes it easy to hold it up near your head when using it to eliminate shadows that you get when held at waist level out in front of you . The beveling around the lens also makes it great to bash skulls with in a zombie-apocalypse type scenario too ! I believe this could probably be weapon mounted too given it 's size and shape . I need 5 more of these things !	1
This is my second Fenix light and I am again impressed with the build , quality , looks , and output . Really love that it takes 4 AA which are cheap compared to the specialty batteries . Without a lumenometer , I 'd definitely back up Fenix 's claim that it is over 500 lumens comparing it to another unit with similar qualities . It really fits nicely in my hands which are not large . I like that it is smaller than my other 500 lumens light , and is all aluminum and not plastic . The power and mode buttons , which are separate , are easily activated and appear very distinct . Although it is a 500 lumens light , it fits nicely in my pants pocket for carrying , but does come with a holster as well . Light beam is not adjustable and I 'd have to say it 's more of a spot light than anything , which is one of the reasons I purchased it . Besides the holster , it comes with an extra `` O '' ring , and rubber power and mode buttons but NOT batteries . If there were any cons , I 'd have to say I 'd prefer the power button on the side rather on the end , but that 's just personal preference . I strongly recommend this light to anyone that wants a powerful , sturdy , and easily held quality built flash light .	1
Very powerful flashlight . Good beam . Shoots far . Useful in the dark mountains at night . Useful as a safety tool for blinding an assailant to buy you time .	1
I normally only use this flashlight on medium brightness because even there it 'll light up a path around 50 ft in front of me . I love that it uses normal double A batteries .	1
This light can illuminate across the pond in my back yard . The distance is around 50 yds . It is small enough to stick in my pocket and I use it when I take the dog out at noght .	1
I received the LD41 as a birthday gift from my wife . I love it for all these reasons.1 ) super bright . 520 lumens is outstanding for a 4 AA light and excellent for spotting despite the fact that it 's LED - an XML - creates more flood light than spot because it 's so big of an LED . So if you 're concerned about that , be wary.2 ) durability and water proof . speaks for itself . aluminum body is light and durable , and i do n't need to worry about dropping it in water or using in rain3 ) multiple modes . varying brightness for almost any situation . only thing that could make it better would be a moonlight mode in my opinion.4 ) form factor . AA batteries are the type of my choice for size , weight and runtime . with 4 , runtime is great ! my only caveats would be it 's not entirely ideal for emergency situations due to the battery holder . it 'd be hard to put in fresh batteries in the dark . particularly if you have to do it in a hurry , but unless you 're grading the light purely on that , i certainly would n't deduct a star . and it 's not ideal for EDC ( every day carry ) due to size and weight , but it 's not really meant to be an EDC light anyway , so i would n't discount the light because of that either . i use it every day for taking my dogs out , and the 520 lumens is great for keeping an eye on the them from a distance .	1
If you are contemplating about getting this flashlight do n't waste your time , just get it ! You will be happy ! This puppy at high setting can light up hell itself , it is that bright . It has adjustable brightness setting that remembers your setting so every time you turn it on it 's on the setting you last had it . It takes AA batteries , I use rechargeable eneloops and it works great . It has a squared body that fits comfortably in your hand without feeling bulky . The on/off and brightness selector switch is side by side , within easy thumb reach . Awesome light ! I own 2 other Fenix lights and I swear by their products .	1
Definitely not a physically large light - overall size and weight match up to the website description , and the light appears to be very well constructed.Personally , I really like the fact it uses readily-available AA batteries . So far , time before recharge is excellent , and the battery carrier is well-built and simple to use.Although there is a slight wobble , my light will stand on end , and easily lights up a room.As far as the beam shape and throw distance , they 're very much as described , and , I see very little tint , whether inside or out of doors.Overall , certainly 5 stars for the price , quality , and performance .	1
Small and bright with a rugged design and multi-operating modes . If you need a lightweight , handy flashlight I would definitely recommend this product .	1
Well made , super bright , runs off 4 aa 's . This light exceeded my expectations with its performance , runtime and brightness . Build quality is also very impressive , Quality stuff . This light also has a design and weight that makes it a formidable defensive tool if need be `` ouch '' I was a little put off at first because my sample has a prounounced green tint in the light . It 's very evident on the first 2 levels but fades to a non issue in the top 2 settings . I understand that led tints can vary from sample to sample and actually there are benifits to a green tint when walking in the woods with better color rendering , but inside on the low settings it is not very appealing . I mainly purchased this light to use outside and for its amazing 520 lumens and I think the tint will turn out to be a benefit . Great light !	1
This product mounts easily and is performing according to the specs . It 's not a great big flood flight , so pay attention to the output based on your needs . I have it mounted on my fence near the gate to provide some light when I take the dogs out . Based on my positive experience with this product , I will be looking at other eLEDing products to solve other lighting needs as well .	1
Well I ordered 2 of them one I think was dammaged or something because it would not charge and box was ruffled by the delivery guys im assuming but I called and they refunded me and paid shipping back . Overall I have the one setup and it is really bright I would say equivalent to a 60-70 watt light but pointed straight outward from the fixture . It seems brighter because its not a round bulb like we are all used too . At night if I walk down my dark alley it comes on and light a good 15 bye 15 area and its like a daylight color 5000k its awesome . I will be buying more for sure just wish they made this same unit with higher output leds and maby less of them then it would probably be equivalent of a 100 watts . Anyways free lighting green technology is here everyone . The cost up front is pricey but hey so is a light fixture from lowes and light bulbs to go with it . Or even more go down and see how much 2 led flood light bulbs will cost you , easily 30 dollars a piece and still you have to pay for electricity maby less but none the less . I will agree in some situations you might need more light but overall 90 percent of the places this thing will do the job . Thanks EESGI AND AMAZON for a great product and great customet service you guys rock and thats why you guys will succeed .	1
This is a Great light , flood light when activated and a soft light when in the night light mode . The motion detector is not too sensitive and works great . It has two adjustments for the range of detection and one for the time on until returning to sleep or soft light mode . I 'm very pleased with this light and I will be glad when Amazon get more in.GREAT LIGHT SO FAR ! !	1
I read a lot of reviews on this before buying . I wanted my side yards and back yard to have lights , but nothing like a pole light . These sides get more sun than my front porch , so solar lights made sense . They were easy to install in concrete walls . I put them up high out of reach without a ladder , but where they could still have sun . They work perfectly . They have a great moonlight effect at night and best of all , they are very sensitive so when I walk around the house at night they light up a large area . So far I am truly happy with the results.The down side is the cost ; but given the results it is worth it as long as they last a long time . They are plastic and for this price , I hope they last . Over all , this is a good purchase as it does what I wanted for my home . I am happy that I found these and have discussed them with a few neighbors who are looking for an option as well .	1
Light unit died 2 weeks after usage above perfectly well lit so-cal garage . Nothing more I can say about this . Will be contacting the manufacture about this product and see if the internal battery failed which is most likely the issue.UPDATE : Bump from 1 to 4 stars after official replacement by eLEDing . My unit 's solar panel was defective . Their resolultion department was fast and responsive but initially blamed the problem on our install orientation and should have replaced our on our first request and not wait till our second request before really testing the unit and confirming the bad panel as the source.UPDATED REVIEW : Pros -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -1 ) Excellent light output . Very bright if you have it facing the sun for at least 4-6 hours a day exposed to full sunlight.2 ) Not very heavy and easily installed on a rain gutter . At first I was worried it would be too heavy but it 's rather light and just look bulkier than it really is.3 ) Adjustable light length and light/motion sensitivity.Cons -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -1 ) Personally I think the current pricing is way high but because there is n't much competition , consumers have to take it.2 ) Quality QA . Had a defective panel that had to be replaced . Please do more QA at the manufacturing plant.Summary -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -A very good and unique high power led light for your garage if you can afford the asking price .	1
I have this on the south side of my garage , it gets sun most of the day , it has never run out of power and it comes on all night long when ever something moves . If you need it somewhere that is shady in the day it can be charged from a external solar panel . It has sensitivity and range controls that get covered from the elements with a snap on cover on side . They even made a template inside the box so you put the screws in correct and level . This is installed on the lip of the garage so when it rains it washed off yet has been waterproof so far . It lights up estimate 15-20 feet out and enough light to see steps on the back porch 30 feet away . Cold weather is here , it this makes it through the winter as well as the last few months I will buy more . As I said best I have owned so far , I have been trying solar lights for at least 14 years.Update 9/13 still going strong as day one , very happy .	1
This is by far the largest & most effective light source we have for night time usage . Large light spectrum area and when motion is detected the light becomes even brighter . Smart , clever & good quality solar powered Led product !	1
Simple yet functional - Very easy to install ! Led lights are bright and I like how it has a good length in time to stay on and an option for range . Its solar with a rechargeable battery equipped with a motion sensor . All pros and no cons . I recommend it for anybody who has dark areas around their homes that does not want to deal with wiring . I may pick up another one later.P.S . Make sure you have it facing some sunlight to recharge .	1
This light is mounted over my garage door and it works perfect . Nice and bright and goes on and off as it is suppose to ... ... ... No problems , .	1
was really great to have it and it is working very well , no need to do any special and easy to install .	1
I bought 2 of this item for my side yard . So far , they hold up well . Nice bright light . They look and feel very good compare to the other solar lights . This one looks like they are part of the building materials . I like it a lot . Hope it will last ( only a month old right now ) . I will report back when winter comes to let you know how it does in rainy Seattle !	1
I bought this Omni LED 60W incandescent replacement for a table lamp . It works well giving off very equal light in all directions though the shade . The Feit provides a & # 34 ; whiter & # 34 ; light than an incandescent , but is not & # 34 ; greenish & # 34 ; as other Led & # 8217 ; s I have tried in the 2700-3000K range . It is pleasant to the eye , not harsh . I will buy more to replace the CFL and incandescent bulbs I have now . Delivery was as promised and on time	1
These lights have very good coverage and are solidly made . The 3000K light has a great white look . Feit is a leader in this field . I highly recommend it .	1
The light is bright and dims well . No issue with flickering . 2 small issues that knock it from 5 stars to 4:1 ) Personally I find the light to be a bit cold . I know it 's 3000K not 2700K , but it fells a lot colder.2 ) The light is omni-directional , but not as much as a regular light bulb . In our fixture the bulbs point down , and we get a huge amount of light on our dining room table , but we also wanted the bulbs to light the ceiling . They do , but now as much I I would have hoped , and not as much as a traditional incandescent bulb.Overall though very happy with the bulb .	1
I ordered and am using three of these bulbs , the LED 13.5 Watt LED Omni - 60W Incandescent Dimmable Replacement Bulb from Feit Electric Performance is very bright and appealing in the fixtures I use them in ( a ceiling fan with Glass Globes that point downward at an angle ) . This and the Phillips A19 are my favorite new LED bulbs for sale through Amazon . I would recommend them at this time and if they last anywhere close to the 22 years of normal use , they will start paying you back quickly for the investment and for years to come . Very nice looking light bulb , bright and cool . 13.5 watts power usage as to a 75 watt incandescent equivalent . I really like it .	1
This is a GREAT replacement to light bulbs that have shades . I was worried about trying to find an LED that mimiced the light direction ( everywhere , not just one direction ) of a normal light bulb . These do just that . Powerful , nice bright light ( not blue ) , and energy efficient . Highly recommend to anyone switching out their normal bulbs to LEDs but want the same type of light output .	1
For the wattage and lumens , this is by far the cheapest led bulb available . With a screwdriver , you can pry the plastic off , and reveal the 35 led diodes . Inside the plastic cover , there is a white reflector ring that blocks half the light to bounce it off the sides . To me , that is inefficient and a waste of power . So I just broke the white reflector off , the lighting to the sides are the same brightness but directly under the light it is now twice as bright . Bought a socket extender and replaced the huge halogen spotlight in the backyard patio , the smaller led bulb is way brighter . Plan on buying more because they are a great bargain . Imagine buying a single 7w led lightbulb for over $ 20 bucks , that is nuts ! People all over Amazon are getting ripped off buying those lower powered higher priced bulbs . As of May 2013 , these are $ 12.99 at your local Menards hardware store . $ 1 per watt ? Get out of town !	1
Purchased a couple from a warehouse outlet and wanted more but they were out . Excellent light output and may be a little bit brighter than its reported to be as a 60W equivalent . Could n't use it with my motion sensor though it would only light dimly .	1
I am new to LED Omni directional lights..with that said , I am very surprised they are as bright as they are . Granted I am using them in a 3 light floor lamp that you can direct to different areas/angles . They are so bright , you do n't want them shining in your eyes . So careful placement/dispersion of light is what I found I needed . I left them on for a short while and did not feel heat from them . Although they have their own heat dispersion method . I gave them four stars because I do n't know about durability , and the price is high at this time ... Can it be true I can use 3 of these and still not being using what a 60 watt incandescent uses ? ! If they last , they will be worth the money in energy savings.I do like that they are white not yellow .	1
The spread is nice , really nice ! I am using this for a table-lamp and the beam is much better when compared to those other bulbs with only less on top.The color is REALLY nice , warmish , not to pink or too yellow , just a sweet incan-tint ! Brightness is great too , at least as bright as a & # 34 ; 60W & # 34 ; bulb.Great for reading , which is what it 's used for ... I will be buying more !	1
I replaced about 10 r20 bulbs in my kitchen with these . The dim pretty well ( although not as low as incandescents , but im using my old lutron dimmer , not one designed for led 's ) . I have them in for about 6 months or so and they are running strong ... .	1
I am really not sure why some people are having issues with these , I have 12 of them in various fixtures both enclosed and open air . The lights have a very warm and consistent coloring which is hard to find with LED 's . I am using various types of standard and electronic dimmers without any flicker or flashing from any of them . In fact I have had far less issues with these than the Ecosmart bulbs I got from Lowes which with the standard dimmers tend to flicker badly at very specific dimming levels . I would highly recommend these to anyone and get a lot of compliments from people as they do not realize they are LED .	1
I put these Feit LED bulbs in my reading lamps . I have replaced all the bulbs in my house with Feit LED bulbs . These are 60 what equivalent . At age 67 I need a bit brighter light for reading . I put LED fluorescent tube replacement bulbs in the fluorescent lights in the kitchen . My wife loved the difference in the light output . It is much brighter . In the bedroom fixtures I put two 40 watt LED Equivalent bulbs in the ceiling fixtures and one 35 watt equivalent in the lamps . My electric bill has decreased greatly and the bulbs last about 25 years . At age 67 I probably wo n't live long enough to have to replace another light bulb .	1
Works great , has good brightness and light distribution with a much whiter light than the cfl it replaced , it took a little getting used to , only time will tell about its lifespan , overall a good product for a good price no complaints from me . I put it in a over head hanging tiffany style light in my living room where the light is on about 4 hours a night , it 's working out well so far and the shade is still well lit .	1
Purchased 5 of these at my local Costco , they were $ 15 each , but had a $ 10 instant rebate from the local power company , so final price was $ 5 . Replaced several 60w traditional bulbs , excellent brightness and one worked in a 2-way lamp for bright , and then dim mode . Did not purchase through Amazon only due to the local power company rebate available at Costco .	1
Bought 3 of these to replace 60W incandescent bulbs , and my first impression was `` Wow , these things are almost 2x as bright ! '' I have these bulbs installed in desk lamps , and have been using them daily for several months . So far the experience has been a positive one . No flickering , no buzzing , no size or clearance issues . The light is distributed to all directions very well , and the color temperature is close to the advertised 3000K . The tint is slightly more green compared to a typical incandescent , but it 's not noticeable unless comparing them side by side .	1
I bought one of thisFeit Electric 13.5W LED Omni Bulbfrom a local warehouse Club five months ago , and have been using it in a dimmer-controlled light fixture . It worked so well that recently I went back to purchase another one . Here 's what I liked about this LED bulb:1 . It is a true '60W Replacement ' LED bulb in that it produces 850 lumens of total light output , exactly the same as that from a 60W incandescent bulb . Many other so-called '60W equivalent ' LED bulbs ( for example , theEarthLED ZetaLux 2 Pro 7-Watt LED Light Bulb ) generate only 400-500 lumens of light output.2 . The LED bulb is nearly an omni-directional light source - not quite as good as an incandescent bulb , but close . This makes it suitable for general illumination to light up a whole room . In contrast , the beam from most other LED bulbs is semi directional , concentrated in forward direction . So they are better suited for down-facing recessed lighting.3 . It works well with any TRIAC-controlled light dimming switches ( this is the most common type used for incandescent bulbs ) . Most other LED bulbs are not compatible with dimming . If you accidentally connect one to a dimmer-controlled light fixture , the bulb will start blinking and can potentially be damaged.I compared the dimming operation of this Feit LED bulb against a 60W incandescent bulb and aPureSpectrum 20W Dimmable CFL , and found the Feit to be superior : - The incandescent turns into a faint red globe at minimum power setting- The CFL is unable to dim all the way down at minimum setting- The Feit LED gives the widest dimming range , while maintaining consistent color temperature . ( See the picture I uploaded to 'Customer Images ' for details ) I also measured the power consumption of this LED bulb using theP4460 Kill-A-Watt Electricity Usage Monitor . The meter shows 14W , which is consistent with the '13.5W ' rating . Its power factor is very high at PF=0.98 , which is a sign of good electrical design . In contrast , many inexpensive LED bulbs I have tested , such as theLighting EVER 6 Watt LED Bulb , have much lower PF . ( Power factor has no direct relation to LED brightness , but a low PF implies more loss in the transmission of electric power ) There is just one potential problem I need to point out : although this LED bulb is called an 'A19 ' , it is actually a bit longer than a typical 60W incandescent A19 bulb . So if your light fixture does not offer enough headroom , this LED bulb might not fit . See the photo I uploaded to 'Customer Images ' section for size comparison.Overall , I found this Feit LED bulb to be a well-designed product suitable for general-purpose illumination . As of this writing , it is priced less than 2x that of a typical 6-7W LED bulb , while generating more than 2x the light output ( 850 vs. 400 lumens ) . So I consider it a great value .	1
I bought two of these at a local warehouse club store . At 850 lumens , this bulb puts out every bit as much light as a 60 watt standard light bulb . Not all energy saving bulbs truly equal their light output claims of being equal to a 60 watt bulb , but this one actually does . The direction of the light that this bulb projects in my opinion is best suited for a table lamp with a shade . With the bulb facing up , as in a lamp , more light goes down and to the sides than straight up out the top . This bulb gets hot ( I measured 157 degrees on the bulbs glass while in an open lamp ) . It would not last long in a glass enclosed light fixture , as it would overheat . There is a picture on the package of an enclosed ceiling light , but I think that is an oversight . The light color ( 3000K ) and is what I would judge to be white light , not blue light or yellow light . This bulb works reasonably well on a dimmer . I will be buying more of these to go in all of my table lamps .	1
Buy this bulb if you have a torchiere floor lamp and worth testing in your table lamps . After comparing five A19 LED bulbs , one A21 LED bulb , and this & # 34 ; omni-directional & # 34 ; bulb ; by far this is the best LED bulb for a floor lamp . It evenly illuminating the entire lamp bowl ; bottom and sides . Unlike the other six bulbs which places a large amount of light on the ceiling and no light on the bottom edge of the glass . It is the heaviest LED bulb of the seven . It also looked good in a table lamp but I choose an A19 bulb with lower lumens and only 8W for the bedroom lamps .	1
These are spot on ! I currently have 10 of these in my house . The first batch is 3 months old with no issues . They din very well with none of the noise like incandescent bulbs make when dimmed . 3000 color is great too . Not blue enough for meat to start looking wierd , but not yellow enough to feel gloomy . Cheerful color.I dropped one last night while installing into a vanity above the bathroom sink . It dropped five feet onto stone counter , bounced and dropped another 3 feet onto ceramic tile . I had to superglue the dome back on the top , but it still works flawlessly !	1
Very clean white light . Works great in table lamp . Complete all around light , plenty of light downward for reading . But it is a 60 watt output , not enough for my old eyes . Looking for 100 watt output , but they are so expensive . I do like this brand , seems well made .	1
I bought them because consumer report rated them a best buy . They are the brightest in the 60 watt equivalent group . They are 925 lumens , although they say only 800 lumens on the box ( 125 extra lumens is nice ) . VERY bright light in a nice even 3000k color bulb . Nice bright warm white light . They feel almost like 75 watt clear incandescent bulbs we use to use .	1
I have been wanting to get a led dimmable light for my ceiling fan and most of the ones that were dimmable looked bad aand you would want people to see them . This one here looks fine in ceiling fan and lites instantly to full illumination and dims very controllable on the way down , will get pretty dim if you want it that dim .	1
This LED light bulb performs as indicated.It is omnidirectional -- which is not true of the typical LED light bulb ( including the one that I replaced with this item ) .I have it in a table lamp with shade and it fits well ( it is not too tall ) and it throws light out through the shade perfectly well.It runs at a lower temperature than an incandescent bulb.Good value -- even approaching $ 15 -- and highly recommended.I have no idea if it will last 22.8 years as it states on the package . ( How can a product be sold with such a claim ? )	1
Got this because we go in and out of a sliding door alot and the door we had always fell off the track onto the ground . For 10 bucks it was a cheap replacement . It actually works well for us , lining up every magnet about 80 % of the time . Its kinda weird walking through it but until we get a better screen door replacement itll do .	1
I used this as a bug screen for a slider , and it worked great dogs can run through it , and the magnets are strong .	1
I had one of these up last year for the first time . It took a bit of time for the dogs and cast to learn that they went through the middle instead of the one side like the other screens we had up previous years . Well , it lasted the outdoor year when we could leave the door open , and had to replace it for the current year ... It just was put to task by 3 big dogs and 2 cats using it for months and months ... It is durable , and the 20 magnets keep a better closure than the few on other 'instant ' screens . Some do n't even mention how many they have , but you can see from the picture that it is just a few . This one is better .	1
A much higher quality than the Magic Mesh . The fabric & # 34 ; tape & # 34 ; on all the edges is thicker as it the mesh . For installation we did not want to poke holes into our door trim . Instead we attached the mesh to a simple frame made from brick mould to set inside the door frame.Pros : * higher quality materials* 1 more set of magnets* quieter closingCons : * none , it 's a fair price for what you get	1
It took me minutes to put this screen door up and 10mins for my animals to figure out how to use it ! ! ! It looks great and the magnets work great would buy again ! ! !	1
I needed a screen door for the side door of my cargo trailer that I converted for camping . I bought this and cut it down to fit my opening . I trimmed the edges with black duct tape and it came out pretty well . I used Velcro on the entire perimeter because it aluminum , not wood . I 'm having little issue with the Velcro staying on due to the extreme temperature swings when it 's not in use . Other that it works great ! ! The door snaps closed and it 's the perfect solution for my setup . If possible I would try to attach it with the tacks that it comes with in addition to the Velcro .	1
Pro-Fenix quality-standard AA batts-Lots of light setting-Pure white light-Easy adjustment-Solid mount , stays put on my head-includes the RED LED ! important for meCons-Ca n't turn on the RED LED without cycling through White first ! ! the whole point of red is to preserve the night vision . But you get blasted with white before you can cycle through to the red . Major oversight.-a bit weird to change the batts - have to take the whole thing apart-little buttons can take a while to locate especially when wearing glovesConsideration : -FLOOD pattern , very wide , no spot at all . I 'd prefer more of a spot as I think a lot of the light gets wasted to the side . Personal preference though.I sue this all the time to work on vehicles , read in bed , etc . Great light ! ! !	1
I 've had a lot of headlamps in my day from midrange to expensive . The I/O is great . The fit is fine . The brightness options are excellent , and the AA battery choice is perfect . I am running Sanyo enloop batts in this light and it it rocks for hours.I have one concern and one complaint . The concern is the life of the ratchet mechanism that adjusts the light angle . It , like most others is friction , but it is not rock solid , and might wear sooner than later.The complaint is the battery compartment is stupidly hard to open only made worse given that the AA batteries need replacing and recharging more often than not.One other note , the strap that rides over your head . It is hard to keep tight and usually loosens up on its own . What it needs is a real buckle from folks who make such things , not a also-ran that looks like a buckle but acts more like a slipknot.For those that complain about the limited duration of full power need to understand two things . First , AA batteries are not the best fro this application so they better look toward CR123 batteries ( and their cost ! ) . And second , the runtime at 200L is actually not bad for AA batts in the first place.For the price , I think this is the one to get . In fact for any price . I have a & # 62 ; $ 100 Surefire headlamp that is nowhere as fine as this one except in its infinite adjustability which is not much of a benefit given the well thought-out lumen levels of this light .	1
This is a very comfortable and bright headlamp.The straps do slip a little bit if you are doing very physical activity and it chews through batteries if you use it on high all the time . Use rechargeables and no worries.The infrared is great for penguin watching in the evening.Overall it is a great unit . It beats the cheap ones i have bought in the past.D	1
Best used to illuminate things in front of you while maintaining a hands free grip on whatever tools you may be employing . Red light is good for map reading without destroying night vision . It 's a light go look for things in the dark .	1
I own a ton of torches , and a couple of cheap headlamps - this thing is solid . Great for camping !	1
As noted in the product details , this is a very wide distribution light and NOT a long-distance spot light - but the throw is adequate for medium distance navigation and plenty bright to light up eyes in the dark ( we use ours mainly for night time dog walking , so getting an early warning of approaching dogs/coyotes is key ) . The output and features for the money is light years beyond what you 'll find at your local outdoors retailer , not sure why I kept screwing around with other headlights which were costing 2x as much with half the output . Making the top band removable is a nice touch for if you do n't need the extra support . Once again pleased with my Fenix purchase .	1
Pros : -Very bright for its size and weight-Two buttons ( comparable headlamps with only one button are too difficult to use ) -Solid , precise angle adjustment mechanism-Wide , shallow profile that just feels good on your headCons : -Battery cover does n't click into place and feels weak-The head band slips and does n't retain its size unless it is on your headI have n't tested it enough yet to decide if the battery life is acceptable .	1
( & SOS pattern , if you hold the proper button down for long-enough ) This thing is n't garish-blue light : it 's neutral-white , & it gives you 4 WONDERFULLY usable brightnesses , it runs on 2 AAs , not on 3 AAAs ( I 'm fed-up with slight differences in cells resulting in reverse-biasing one cell , destroying its lifespan/usability , and thereby trashing my investment in batteries : fewer cells is better ! ) the dimmest white is enough to find things with , without blasting your eyes ... I find that when walking through the forest , exhausted , I need to start at the next-level-up , then as I get more tired , increase the brightness to keep me awake while I hike toward my tent/home ... it 's very well made , good glass covering the white LED , the case feels solid , you have to get the body off the tilt-mount to get the batteries out , it 's simply solid , logical , good quality light , lasts well on Powerex batteries ( you want Powerex AAs & a WizardOne charger for 'em ! ) Fenix HP01 210 Lumens Headlamp - 2 x AA Battery - Orangeis what I tried to buy , but it was n't shippable to Canada , so I got this instead ... Specifications-wise , they seem similar ( except the HP01 has its battery-pack in back , instead of in front ) .I may never buy another brand of headlamp or flashlight ! No strobing , unlike Planet Bike , Maglight , etc , No crappy build , unlike Energizer 's junk ... it just works right , is right , & I carry it on me all the time , now , instead of carrying some other kind of flashlight ... it 's just too good.Wonderful , & if there 's any brand in lights I can recommend ... this is it . ( you may be shopping for LEDs some time , to make something for yourself ... If so , try the ANSI WHITE ones , like LuxeonStar 's ANSI-WHITE LEDs , and these headlamps seem to be about 4100k or 4000k in color-temperature : quite nice color ! 3000k is orange-ish white , and 5000k is blue-ish white.4000k-4200k is called `` neutral '' white : it 's easy on our eyes : ) Namaste !	1
This thing continues to astonish me when I turn it on , especially in comparison to my old headlamp . The great thing is that it has several settings so you can dim the light for general camp use ( to save battery ) then turn it full blast if you need to do some night hiking . It also has a red light mode which is great when you get up in the middle of the night and do not want to wake up your tent mates with a bright light.I liked it so much I immediately bought a second one for my girlfriend . Maybe now she 'll stop asking to borrow mine ... .	1
Super bright for a headlamp . I used mine quite a bit now , I have had it for a few months . Been in the rain with it , mudding on the four wheeler , burning brush and sawing with this headlamp and no problems what so ever . Good run times with AA batteries , I use sanyo eneloop and they last forever in it . Very versitile amount of light you can get out of it . Good warranty too , Fenix stands by their product .	1
I bought this mostly for repairs , but I love how many critters I have found in the backyard that I did n't saw before , particularly spiders . Once I found one with a lot of tiny spiders on its back ! Thanks to the reflective eyes of many night bugs . Also , it has a powerful beam of course !	1
This is by far my favorite headlamp so far . I keep buying these and giving them as gifts or putting them in places I may need them ( added one to my car kit ) .The brightness is fantastic , there are multiple levels of bright from moon to very very bright . Wearing the headlamp with headband is comfortable ( I do n't used the over the top strap ) , not too heavy . The controls for the turning the light on/off and through different brightness are easy and intuitive . The tilt functionality allows you to position the light in whatever angle you want ( truly needed feature ) .I have not gone hiking with this at night , which is where I 'd use the red-light feature , so have n't really tried this out.Overall this is a pretty simple headlamp that provides a great value in functionality and lighting brightness for the price .	1
I have just finished installing about 14 of these switches all over my house ( and another dozen Insteon dimmers ) . Installation was pretty easy even though I was new to home wiring ( and despite the fact that I 'm an electrical engineer ) . After installing over two dozen new Insteon wall switches , I 've become pretty comfortable with installing these ; now it only takes me about 5-10 minutes to install or replace one of these . More time is spent pushing the wire and wire nuts back into the wall and checking that the switch is flush and level with the wall ... enough about me ... This switch is a quality product . Nothing feels `` cheap '' about this . The clicking is satisfying and does n't feel hollow but like a good mechanical switch . It only requires a light touch to activate.The switch is very attractive . I think it looks much classier than the GE/Jasco Z-wave switches , which have buttons and other things offset and not arranged symmetrically . The Insteon `` set '' button is centered below the rocker switch and remains inactive and unlit except during linking . The LED `` gauge '' indicator is present on this on/off switch but only lights up the bottom ( off ) or top ( on ) LED . I was n't crazy about this since there is no point to the indicators in between but I 've gotten used to it . This brings me to some of my minor negatives with this switch . With a mix of a dozen on/off switches and a dozen dimmers , I ca n't tell which is a dimmer and which is an on/off switch inside my house yet ... another minor negative is that those `` indicators '' are just plastic light guides to the actual white LED 's located inside the switch . The issue with this is that there is a lot of light leakage so that you never see just one of those dots lit . You can adjust the indicator brightness via the Insteon Hub or any other method that lets you control the indicator brightness so that you reduce this leakage.The size of this switch is comparable to the Lutron dimmers that I 've installed . In terms of other Insteon switches , from smallest to largest : Insteon 2-wire dimmer , Insteon dimmer switch , Insteon on/off switch ( this ) . The WeMo wall switch is the largest wall switch I have and the hardest to install for me because of its size.One last note ... I think another reviewer noticed this as well but these are n't completely white . They are slightly off-white . I would NEVER have been able to tell except for the fact that I installed these with a Lutron Claro wall plate which is glossy white . You ca n't really see the color difference unless the room is very brightly lit up.I am extremely happy with the performance and quality so far . I have n't had any out of the box failures in the over two dozen Insteon wall switches that I 've installed so far.To wrap up , I have WeMo , Insteon , Z-wave , Nest and Hue in my home but so far I 'm most impressed with the Insteon system for consistent quality and performance . I am using the Insteon Hub and Revolv to manage my network but I 'm about to transition to Indigo for the Mac .	1
I use this clever device to control my low voltage landscape lights . The lights are powered through an outdoor transformer . I set the transformer to & # 34 ; On & # 34 ; all the time and control its power through the switch . I manage this and all my Insteon devices with a Universal Devices controller which I am also very pleased with . In fact , I am very impressed with the entire Insteon product line . My house gets smarter with each new device . My only concern is that one day the house might outsmart me !	1
INSTEON is a great standard and their products are usually of high quality . Very much to my satisfaction.I experienced some color problems with previous revisions , where I would receive different switches with different shades of white . Which is not a huge problem if you install the switch by itself and the face plate is not too far off . But if you have multiple switches next to each other , it looks pretty funky.I recently ordered another of the SwitchLinc switch and unfortunately received a bad unit . This was the first time I got a defective product from INSTEON though.I would recommend INSTEON at any time to my friends and family . Compared to other subscription/plan options from automation companies , this system does n't cost you anything per month and you can start small and upgrade gradually .	1
I have now installed about 8 of these without incident . I am using the Revolv in addition to the insteon Hub to control them . The switch wires up like any other switch . I had no issues & # 34 ; pairing & # 34 ; it . The sequential lights look nice as well . Very satisfied so far .	1
It 's a wonderful and a perfect bit set it has almost everything you need from various bits and sizes . It 's a must buy if you are looking for a total package	1
Every one of those strange , proprietary , rare driver bits is in this kit . Everything seems sturdy enough and well organized , I do n't think I 'll need to buy anything else like this for many years .	1
Nowadays manufacturers just love to mess with consumers , I was taking out the centre console of a nissan pathfinder made in Europe , I had to use phillips , torx and star ; why on earth would they use three different screw types in mounting one part ? ? ? Thank God I had purchased this or I would have had a heart attack.Having said that , this kit is a must for the home handy man . It is not industrial grade , but for the price it is good , feels good and likely get the job done.Highly recommended !	1
This has every bit I need and some . Great little tool box to have . Stores easily . Finally got rid of my 10 year old allen wrench sets .	1
I bought this for my workbench for working on guitars and other small electronics which it great for . Not the highest quality , but if it ai n't in there , you probably do n't need it !	1
I got this set to mainly work on my hobby grade R/C cars . After mistakenly receiving an older Tekton set and checking out the old driver handle , the new driver handles are definitely better than the old ones since they have magnets to hold the bits in place . Beware , though , that I 've had the small magnet fall out of the handle once . I 'll probably end up using a dab of epoxy to keep the magnet in place .	1
This is really an exceptional kit , they have really nailed the right mix for getting nearly anything electronic opened and closed back up again . I only have occasional need for them so I do n't know how they would last under daily use but they look and feel very good and from the ones I have used that is no signs of the tool edges.The storage case is well made also and keeps them well organized and easy to find the right bit.For my use this is as good as gets , I would easily recommend it to others .	1
This case has every bit that I 've ever seen and never seen prior to owning this set . I saw this kit while looking for another tool and bought it based on the fact that screwdriver bits tend to grow legs and walk away so that when you need them , you ca n't find them . In other words , the more bits , the better . This set definitely has more bits . A couple of weeks after buying the case , I made use of one of the secure torx bits ( these bits have a hole in the center which matches to a post protruding from the screw ) . I would have normally used brute force tactics if not for the exact match bit in this set . There are other bits for security screws that I 've never seen before , but am now ready for . The included ratchet handle works well and gave a comfortable feel to the hand while providing a stable setting for the bit while in use.With all of the previous flattery , be assured of what this set is providing and what it is not . The bits are not made of the highest rated tungsten carbide steel . They are not coated with diamond dust for grip strength . They are not made for commercial hourly/daily use . If this is what you need , move on to another set or buy bits individually meeting these specific needs . If , however , you are looking for a light hobbyist , homeowner , emergency-get-out-of-security-bit-jail set , this is a great set for you .	1
I tinker and repair ... that 's just who I am . Unfortunately , too many manufacturer 's decide to use specialty screws to prevent folks like us from gaining access to products so that we have to return them for repair , or throw away and repurchase . A tool kit like this contains just the bits you need to open and repair these products , which can save you tons of money . I 've repaired coffeemakers . vacuums , fans , and countless other items with these bits . I had a smaller set for many years , which I loaned out and was never returned . This particular set is far more complete and is an well-made , and a tremendous value for the price .	1
This is an extremely handy bit set and have saved me from dozens of situations when I needed the right bit for the work.It has square , torx , clutch , pozi bits in various sizes.I use this with my electric screwdriver as well and it works great ! Highly recommended to all ... homeowners or even DIY enthusiasts alike .	1
This is the perfect kit for those of you who like to tweak and take things apart . It comes with virtually all the bits and security bits ( some kits will have a T8 and a T10 ; this kit included the T9 too ) . The bits are made fairly well and the hard case held the pieces well . It also comes with a micro-kit for those fine tune delicate operations , The ratchet is nothing spectacular , but I think it 's built well enough and serves it 's purpose well	1
It speaks for itself..a bit for everything.. no more scratching my head to find the right bit , in a nice organized little plastic case..awesome .	1
As of yet , I have not come across a bit I needed that was not in this kit . The quality is good , and the bits are arranged logically and lock in securely into their slots . The lack of the fifth star is due to the robustness and/or hardness of the metal . While attempting to loosen up a rather stubborn slotted head bolt , I over torqued the bit and deformed it . Since I determined that I took the tool beyond its capabilities ( for the price paid ) , it was not completely the limitation of the tools but my wallet 's limit . Overall I have been very satisfied with this product .	1
This is the tool set you need to get into anything including all those weird tamper resistant fasteners . Quality is so-so , but very acceptable for the money , especially for fastener bits that will be rarely used , but critical when you need them .	1
I love it , i have yet to find a head that does n't fit something . I just wish i had a power screwdriver to go with this kit .	1
Like I said , the name of this set says it all . They 're not kidding about & # 34 ; Everybit & # 34 ; . Everything you could possibly need is in this set , including the funky Apple screw bits .	1
I need some tool kit like this one , and TEKTON make this quality very well in such price . I have many item from TEKTON , but I do not like China made TEKTON , Taiwan made TEKEON will be better if you want one .	1
So far , so good . Several of the bits were dislodged in shipping , when replacing them the bits do feel a bit brittle and weak . MOST projects will not require much torque so this should not be much of an issue in most applications ( knocking on wood ) . Otherwise if your application requires much force , I would look elsewhere for a toolkit . This set is a tremendous value to have the right tools on hand . The newer laptops , cell phones and electronics including blu-ray players are now commonly needing these specialty bits to open the device . My Dell XPS laptop requires a T5 , the iphones require a T4 and a blu-ray player we own requires the security bit ( there 's a tiny pin sitting upright inside the screwdriver opening which requires a tiny hole inside the bit ... ) I would definitely recommend and buy this set again as long as the bits were not being used with much force . Customer service can be reached at 1-888-648-8665 for support at tekton tools .	1
So I have worked with this set pretty extensively , although there are some bits ( the tri-wing , clutch ) that I have never used and do n't anticipate having to use , although one never knows . The hex , philips , torx , pozi and even the spanner have been pressed into service , some heavily . I will say at the outset that the driver handle is ok , but feels a little cheap , it hasnt let me down , but also doesnt inspire confidence that it wo n't . That is the only negative , and it is minor as I imagine anyone buying this set has another hex socketed multi-bit driver handle that you could use.The bits themselves are great , very precisely machined ( forged ? ) and of very high quality steel , some I bleieve are actually 3v , which is a super tough tool steel . The variety is fantastic and the case is useful for keeping them all organized and together . I am not sure how I got by without this .	1
Most variety out of any set I 've seen . average quality . Had bits I needed to fix my Nintendo we . very happy with it .	1
I do circuit bending and basic electronic repairs.I often find strange and obscure screws that I can not remove ( easily ) .This kit has almost every bit I could imagine and plenty I have not heard of anymore.Now no electronic toy is safe from my evil modifications . Mwahahaha ! ! !	1
Case feels a little cheap but overall a great selection of bits for considerably less then a certain well known department store brand , no qualms here .	1
I highly recommend this to anyone who owns something that has a screw in it ! I have to repair tons of electronics . This kit has everything you need . Some bits twice .	1
i was going to give this as a gift , and got one for myself as well . having every bit i could ever use is handy . there is some kind of guaranty on this that if it breaks they will replace it . but i have n't tested that yet , as i did twist a small bit . it 's nice though to be able to take apart an entire hard drive ( i get their magnets out ) , without resorting to more drastic measures . the only thing i wish it did have are nut drivers . i got them separately , but i would rather have them in in case .	1
I do n't feel like reiterating what has already been said . I will say that it it is missing the triangle and tri-groove . This set would also be improved if it included the two bits that Nintendo uses on their vintage consoles and cartridges.Aside from these minor complaints this set is awesome . I used to be a regular screwdriver kind of guy but kind of got hooked on the ratcheting type within the past year . Plus this takes up way less space in my toolbox compared to a complete set of full-sized screwdrivers . I guess if you are working on cars all day every day changing bits is a real chore but I am not that kind of tinkerer . I am thinking of buying another one of these because one is just not enough to have around the house.I also recommend picking up Tekton 's nutdriver bit set that is compatible with the 1/4 & # 34 ; hex drive .	1
This kit has pretty much every screwdriver security bit available in SAE and metric . The steel is hard so you wo n't strip the bit . The grips are versatile and can fit all bits for different size jobs . It comes in a real case so you do n't lose bits . For less than $ 40 , you ca n't beat it ! ! !	1
This is a very well stocked bit set . I have a couple of other sets that I have purchased recently are missing a few of the sizes I have needed . This one has everything I have needed so far and contained the ones that were missing from my other sets . I like the additional separate small kits for working on small electronics with their own driver and small case as well . Great set , way to go Tekton.I would recommend this for anyone that needs to work on multiple items that use specialty bits or standard hex and other bits . This kit in my opinion , has everything I have come across so far .	1
I caught this set around $ 26 and grabbed it - I 'm so happy I did.In case you 're wondering , the small red case is the same as theTEKTON 2830 Everybit Tool Kit for Electronics , Phones and Precision Devices , 27-PieceThis set has the most extensive and complete collection of security bits I 've seen : clutch ( hourglass shape ) , squares , pozi ( 8 pt . stars ) , forks ( 2 pt . recessed flat-blade ) , torques ( 6 pt . stars ) ( with and without center slug ) , and hex ( with and without center slug ) . Plus there are many sizes of standard Phillips and flat-blades to choose from.Based on some of the other comments regarding the quality of customer support from Tekton , buying these was a simple decision .	1
Constructed well , organized well and just about everything bit wise a guy could ask for and more . Very satisfied . Priced just right . To be honest I think this set is worth 40-60 bucks and that 's probably what you 'll pay if you get it from a hardware store or specialty shop . I ca n't say I 've ever seen a set like this at Home Depot or like store . Amazon comes through again ! ! Just what I wanted . BTW , I make a living with tools and have my whole life . This set does n't just sit on a shelf in my garage , it works as hard as I do .	1
These are n't as fancy as they appear online but they will get the job done . They come in a decent case , and have a ton of bits for almost every job you can think of . I 'll be glad to have all these extra bits in my workshop . So many times have I needed a very tiny bit to take apart a laptop hard drive or something similar , and have n't had the correct bits . Some of the bits are so small it hurts my eyes to look at them.The quality is n't too bad , the screw driver is made of hard plastic , as is the other screw driver.The case is a very hard plastic and it can sometimes be a pain to get the bits out of the case . Sometimes I cut myself on the bits because they are very small and sharp .	1
I am not the world 's handiest guy , as a matter of fact I usually need to get friends to help me to fix or install things at my home . However , since I love gadgets and have a lot of them I find myself in need of specialized bits just to change batteries on some of my devices . I settled on this product because it seemed to have everything that I could every need . I do n't even know what many of these bits are for but at least I have them.I have several friends that always have the right tool for whatever situation presents itself . Recently one was over at my house and we needed an unusual hex-type bit for something that we were trying to fix . I whip out my Everybit repair kit and you should have seen how big his eyes got ! Finally , I was finally able to one-up someone with my tools .	1
TEKTON 2841 Everybit and Electronic Repair Screwdriver Bit Set , 135-PieceThis is an impressive kit , with just about every conceivable bit type ( 14 in all , not the 12 stated in the Amazon ad ) - in a huge variety of bit sizes . Even if you have an extremely well-equipped shop as I do , odds are that it lacks many of these bit types . Bits lock into their respective places in the molded plastic case , with that bit 's type and size clearly marked ; so if one is missing from the case , you 'll know which one it is . The bits themselves are S-2 steel ( for you metallurgists ) with a sandblasted finish , and seem to be as good as those in my Bosch bit set . I 'll probably never use them all - but none has broken so far . Off-center holes in the centers of security bits would be an indicator of poor quality ; but the holes in my Tekton security bits are well-centered.The larger of the two included drivers is a ratchet type , but can be set to non-ratchet . Its end cap unscrews , revealing space in the hollow handle for over a dozen spare bits or bits you 'll need on a specific job.This kit supersedes theTEKTON 2840 Everybit Ratchet Screwdriver and Bit Set , 105-Piece . Set 2840 's ratchet employed a ball-bearing to help secure bits and some Amazon customer reviewers say that ball-bearing fell out of their ratchet . This 2841 kit 's large driver uses a purely magnetic bit holder , which is an improvement ( the bits however , are not magnetic ) .The kit includes a separate case of 20 mini-bits , similar in size to an eyeglass screwdriver set , but with more unusual bits such as the tiny T3 & T4 star bits and the minuscule # 1 Pentalobe driver . In the case is a mini-driver with a rotating handle butt for spinning fasteners on & off . This driver 's steel bit-holder retains bits via a an internal spring . Tekton calls this a `` precision bit and driver set designed for mobile and electronic devices '' - be sure to click on `` view larger '' for detailed photos of this kit 's components.Except for the very largest bits in this set , an impact driver 's instant repetitive force could easily shatter the bit . So ... , think of this kit as hand tools.The kit is made in Tiawan.Most customers should be happy with the variety of bits , overall quality of the kit , and the relatively low price . However , the one thing I ca n't evaluate is how the bits hold up over time - e.g. , whether they prematurely strip or break . They seem fine , but only time will tell in that regard ... This kit 's components have a Lifetime Replacement Guarantee , see `` Comments '' below . Based on Amazon reviews of other Tekton products , this company seems to stand by their products .	1
These work well . Hopefully they will be the plugs of choice for many more products soon . just put one behind a book case where the outlet was just 6 inches from the side . This fit perfect and I can use the outlet without moving the bookcase now . Hurray	1
I needed a cord that mounted flush to the wall and this fit my needs , worked great but a little pricey .	1
This is a pretty simple cord . It is manufactured well . I 've only had it for a month or so , but it does its job well . No complaints .	1
I bought this because I put in a DIY wine glass rack in the open space above my over-the-range microwave . The microwave outlet is & # 34 ; conveniently & # 34 ; located in the center of that space on the wall . I wanted to fix that so I could have room for more stemware . This worked great . Has no problem handling full electrical load of a microwave . Latex paint steems to stick well to the outer coating as well to make it rather invisible . I recommend this product .	1
These are ideal for plugging in stuff right behind something that sits close to the wall . The plug is flush with the wall , and rotates so the cord hangs down regardless of the orientation of the prongs .	1
I was using a ground mounted spot light with an extension cord to light my flag at night . It worked well except for having to remove the cord when it was time to cut the grass . I bought this pole light based on reviews on Amazon . Right out of the box , it stays lit all night . While not as bright as the AC spot light , it still gives adequate light for all night display . I was able to remove the exposed extension cord . The only complaint I have is that the leds are the cool color and mute the colors in the flag . It would be better if they were made with the warmer color leds . Maybe the next generation .	1
I have to admit , it takes some getting used to since it looks a lot like you have just landed a space ship on your flag pole . But just how important is it that you do the right thing with a well-lit flag at night ? I have purchased 6 different pole and ground lights only to be disappointed with the amount and direction of the light . They simply could not perform no matter how much money I spent . I was beginning to think I was going to have to do the respectful thing and take my flag down every night.This light is not only very bright , it has plenty of storage surface so it stays lit . As much as it looks like a spaceship , it really is awesome at night , almost like a halo that shines down on Old Glory . I am pleased and so are my neighbors .	1
I have only owned this product for 10 days and it performs perfectly . I installed the light assembly in a matter ofminutes after a 1 day charge . The light shines proudly on the flag and the last time I checked was still going strong after 7 hours.Very happy with this purchase .	1
Very Nice Light Works Great	1
Arrived as expected . I fabricated this light to work on a flag pole I made with 6 ' white PVC with a rod inside for rigidity . It is mounted on my front porch post at 45 degrees off the top of the post with a standard heavy duty pole mount bracket . I used a 45 degree fitting at the top with a 6 & # 34 ; section on top of that with an end cap on top that with the flag pole light attached to it . The first night in service was 25-30 mph winds and that flimsy flag was strait out and the light and pole worked great . It works perfect and lights up just great all night long . The solar light is about 10 ' off the ground and cast circular light pattern on the ground of about 12 ' across . Very Cool to have lighting this way . Almost do n't need my front porch light on . The best is to have a ground light that points up but in my circumstance there 's no place to put a ground light . This works perfect for me . Time will tell how long the cells will work . Longevity with LED 's is never a problem but corrosion with contacts somewhere inside the housing a problem with all LED fixtures . For now I am very pleased.Manufacturer note : You guys have a fine product and I 'd like this solar panel array to be modified to have a single focusing , directional light on the same side as the solar cells to shine up on a flag for ground applications . The amount of surface solar cells seems to be able to handle something like the Led Lenser optics and what ever LED . The biggest problem with something that is to good is any liberal minded thief can walk up and claim an entitlement to it .	1
This thing is awesome . I 've had mine up for about 4 months and it shines on ! I had to enlarge the mounting hole with a drill because the hole was too small for the bolt on top . But it provides the exact light that is needed to illuminate the flag.Very happy with my purchase and would highly recommend it to others	1
I could n't be happier with this purchase . I have been wanting to add light to my flag , when up at night . The cost of running an underground service to the base if the pole was too high to justify . I ran across this while on the Amazon site and it fits the bill perfectly . It can be installed in less than 5 minutes and works very well , giving off a very nice glow on the flag .	1
I have tried several ways to light up my flag at night and have n't been satisfied with any until now . This light is perfect ! I live in an area where sunny days are few and far between.Even after many rainy and overcast days in a row , this light shines all night . I highly recommend it .	1
The American flag should not be flown at night with out a light to show its glory . This light does our flag justice and I FLY IT 24/7 proudly .	1
Would have given it five stars except it does n't light the whole flag . Bulbs burn brightly but does n't cover the entire flag . Maybe if the lights were tilted out a few degrees more it would do the trick . Other than that it was very easy to install .	1
Here 's a nice light to illuminate flags that has other applications also . The light illuminates well any object directly below it , so it lights a flag well without being overbearing . With 20 LEDs the Sunny tech throws out more light than any other solar light I have tried . Just make sure it gets plenty of light during the day to charge it . The on/off switch is a push button ; I could n't tell at first whether the unit was on or off because I stupidly pushed the button too many times when I took it out of the box . Finally when it got dark I got the light turned on.Our dogs get me up just about every night ; I 've seen the flag light on at three and four in the morning which shows it has some longevity of lighting.If you do n't have a flag , you can mount this light on a pole to light up a large area of yard . Again must make sure it 's in a place that gets plenty of light . For a few days I set mine atop a clear , glass candle holder for a beautiful effect and widespread light on the deck . The light reflecting off and through the glass is very beautiful.Bottom line - So far I am very pleased with the SunnyTech Solar Light for Flagpoles.Comment Comment | Permalink	1
The kit includes both the LL20 360deg line laser and LD3 remote detector with clamp . Also included are batteries and an a easy to use case . It does NOT include a tripod , leveling rod for the receiver , laser target plate , or laser viewing glasses.This product is very easy to use and the range is great . Even outdoor in bright sunlight the detector easily alerts on the laser line which is not visible in daylight . I was able to detect in all 4 corners of a football field with the laser transmitting from the center of the 50 yard line . Resolution at this range is reported to be within about 1mm of levelSuper easy to use , just turn it on , no calibration , no start up , no spinning mirrors to worry about wearing out . The LD3 detector has LCD displays on both sides , so you can read either inside or outside of the laser perimeter.The detector has a few buttons you will want to be familiar with , one for locating the beam in a course resolution or fine tune the level , speaker volume , and an extended range button.The combination of both devices use readily available and inexpensive AA batteries , a total of 6 , 4 on the transmitter and 2 on the detector . No need to worry about environmental conditions , the devices are moisture rated with the IP55 classification.While no tripod is included , the device will accept either 1/4 '' -20 or 5/8 '' -11 threads and the detector clamp should work with a wide range of professional leveling rods or anything else less than 2 1/4 '' that is vertical on the right side of the detector ( facing away from the beam ) . The clamp is not positionable so that it could be used on the left , top , or bottom of the detector .	1
Amazing range for a little unit at 530 feet . It comes with nice , sturdy case , as well a laser detector , bracket and 6 AA batteries . Not only is it cheaper than a rotary , but it will probably last longer because there are no moving parts . If this gets out of level when you 're far away , it will warn you which is nice.Mostly it 's simple . One switch , on or off , and you 're set . I love it.I do n't do a lot of leveling applications , but the LL20 makes me wish I did .	1
Originally we had intended to update the review on this product earlier but in the midst of several projects , fell behind . However , once the day finally arrived when this terrific little device was needed , WOW ! It 's super easy to use and provides a very visible laser view that is easy to see.It comes enclosed in a pre-molded case and includes a remote/detector which is not obvious from the above description but makes a tremendous difference in operation and functionality ! It seems quite durable and perfect for toting to job sites . Additional accessories are available but not included . Aside from that one factor , this is basically one button operation that allows someone to work alone ( a HUGE plus ) and does n't require a lot of tweaking to get a good reading/view.I wo n't repeat the information provided in other reviews but only agree with the one suggestion of including eyewear and a plumb line in future versions . The price ( as of the time of this writing ) is substantially less than the prior reviewers mention making this a very worthwhile addition . This was first experience using CST/berger although Bosch has been a regular ... VERY impressed by the quality and intuition of the product . Would certainly consider looking into CST for future purchase assuming the quality is as good as this .	1
The product description on Amazon for the LL20 is written by someone who does n't actually want to sell any of these , because even though it makes a very brief mention , it does n't exactly call out that this product includes the LL20 laser level AND the LD3 laser detector.The description merely says : '' when operated with the innovative LD3 Laser Detector '' The good news - the LD3 is included , as are the required clamps , a hard case and all the batteries . Most units at this price only include the laser itself.CST/Berger sounds like a cheap brand , but it is part of Bosch Tools - so you do get a great quality product . That said , at this price you only get a single plane - when products like the Bosch GLL3-80 and the DeWalt DW089K do multiple planes.Operation is simple ( but will require a tripod and a rod for mounting the detector . All in all , while the quality is definitely there , the price seems rather high for what you get . If you are a pro , you 'll go with something better , and as an amateur this is too much product .	1
Pardon me for a minute while I climb out from under my rock . I 've been laboring under the impression that Bosch was the great and mighty laser tool maker and all others followed after . Now I find out CST/berger and Bosch joined forces in 2008 and Bosch is just entering the laser marketplace . Do n't quote me but I think the LL20 is comparable to the Bosch GRL400 series . I do n't know why companies like this or Dewalt/Porter cable , Stanly/black and Decker etc . make two lines of tools . I suspect one tool is supposed to be higher end than the other.Having said all that , the LL20 is a great little tool . No more standing around with a pole and transit . This is a one-man operation . Automatic leveling . One switch operation . The product description did n't make this completely clear , in my opinion , but the LD3 laser detector and clamp is included in a very nice fitted hard-side case . Also the six required batteries . You can work inside without the detector up to 65 ft. Operating temperature is 14 degrees F to 104 degrees F. Mount threads are 1/4-20 and 5/8-11 . Leveling accuracy is 3/16-in @ 100ft . Do yourself a favor and get the glasses ( about $ 10 ) . 2 year warranty . By the way the `` product dimensions , 14.75 X 13.75 '' are for the case , I think , not the LL20 .	1
This bulb seems fully compatible with the halogen bulb it replaces . Now I 'm hoping that it lasts as long as claimed . Bottom line : for these expensive bulbs , keep the paperwork !	1
I was looking to replace three 50-watt Par20 halogen bulbs for the track lighting fixture on my kitchen ceiling . These are important lights , as they illuminate the stove , and , without them , it is difficult to cook properly on the stove and see what is happening with the food in the pots and pans . I was already familiar with Philips ' LED bulbs , having used several of their 8-watt and 11.5-watt bulbs in my bathroom and kitchen counter fixtures . Those are the bulbs with the yellow-colored tops , and they 've worked very well for me thus far , for over one year . So , I was already convinced of the quality of the Philips ' LED offerings , based on my personal experience.I just replaced my three halogen 50-watt bulbs with three of these 8-watt Philips bulbs , and the results are awesome ! The light that is emitted by this bulb is a warm , spotlight-type beam that illuminates an area approximately three feet wide ( 25 degrees of coverage , as stated on the packaging ) , which , when I adjust the angle of the fixture holding the bulb , or swivel it in its track , can be aimed exactly where I need it . The bulb itself is a `` normal '' -looking white bulb with four large LED 's , and a metal heatsink on the outer rim of the bulb , at the bottom , and with small vents above , also . In weight and appearance , the bulbs are very similar to the halogens that they replaced , except that they definitely look a little more modern and `` cooler . `` I 'm very happy with these bulbs so far . Note that the expected lifespan of these bulbs , as claimed by Philips , is an astounding 41.1 YEARS ! ! ! This is at 3 hours of usage per day , `` Based on engineering testing and probablity analysis , '' as it states on the side of the box . If the bulb lasts one quarter of that timespan , I 'll be happy . These bulbs offer great light and , in my set-up , energy savings of 126 watts ( three 50-watt bulbs = 150 watts - three 8-watt bulbs ( 24 watts total ) = 126 watts saved ) . Specs , as stated on the packaging , are as follows : Brightness : 450 lumens ; Estimated Yearly Energy Cost : $ .96 cents , based on 3 hours of usage per day , at 11 cents per kWh ; Estimated lifespan : 41.1 Years ( ! ! ! ) - Based on 3 hours of usage per day ; Color temperature : 2700 K ( very `` warm '' ) Angle of light beam coverage : 25 degreesEnergy used : 8 wattsWarranty period : 5 years	1
We bought two of these to replace our recessed shower lights . So far so good . They are brighter than the halogen bulbs they replaced , but burn 85 % less energy . They are n't cheap , but will be worth it if the last a few years . We just hope they can withstand the heat of a lensed recess fixture .	1
We 've used these to replace the halogens . The light is perfect ( and we 're VERY picky about that -- LOL ) . In two of the 20 fixtures we have them in I 've noticed a slight buzzing sound . Those fixtures are dimmable but there are other dimmable fixtures where this is n't noticeable . It may be that particular fixture . It 's two sets of fixtures on one split control . Or it may just be the wiring in that room .	1
Color is excellent , very hard for me to tell from a quartz halogen , which has long been the 'gold standard ' for lighting color for me for pure warm interior light . Also at least as bright as a 50W halogen while having a more even beam spread . The 36 degree beam is wider than than a halogen 'spot ' bulb but still probably not as wide as a normal 'flood ' bulb , and so fits my needs pretty well . Also , some halogens have a very oddly shaped spread pattern with hot spots , and this odd light pattern can actually shimmer when the bulb is shaken ( like when a door or cabinet door is slammed . ) This LED on the other hand has a perfectly regular even spread and no shimmering ! Yay.I have been pretty disappointed in the past with 3000K LED bulbs from Ecosmart and TCP . Does n't sound that different from 2700K but definitely too cool in color , and while dimmed with my dimmers they flicker pretty badly . This Philips on the other hand has no flicker and dims very nicely and evenly . Those other bulbs will last for years but now I have to figure out somewhere to move them where I do n't need great color or a dimmer.Lastly , an incandescent or halogen dims to yellow then orange when it gets down low enough , these bulbs stay the same color.I have been hopeful in trying various LED bulbs in the last three years , but until now most have had drawbacks . Mostly the color has been too cool and clinical . At this point my only possible complaint is that it would be nice if they could get the price down another 25 % , but still , these bulbs pay for themselves in a couple years anyway in energy savings . 8 watts versus 50 - what more can you say ? I will be getting some more as I have about 20 par bulbs in ceiling cans . I will also try some of the other Philips bulbs in the 13 and 15 watt varieties in this series , as some places it would be nice to have a bit brighter bulb . For A style regular table lamb bulbs I 'm pretty sold on the Cree bulb ( the A bulb perfected ) .One reviewer reports bad experience with a Variac dimmer - this is a VERY unusual type of heavy transformer-dimmer so unless you are one of the few who actually have such I would not let this put you off . Most dimmer switches these days are of the electronic variety and I have two different types and the bulbs work with both .	1
When I bought this I was expecting to get the basic tool bag that comes with most of the combo kits . This is one step up . It a small pocket allong one side that is meant for tool accessories or documents . It was reenforced on the bottom and lined all over on the inside .	1
I bought two of these because I really liked my larger one . These have proved to be perfect for my 1/4 sheet sander and the pockets are just right for holding additional pieces of sandpaper of various grits . Well made , sturdy bag .	1
Nice , sturdy , attractive bag for small tools / supplies , even if they are not the DeWalt brand . Worth the money , in my opinion .	1
Perfect for holding your drill and all of your bits . Nice to have a compact package that holds whatever you need.Feels sturdy and I expect it to last for a long time .	1
As most tools these days come without cases , I have resorted to tool bags , and enjoyed the upgrade.My earlier success with a larger Dewalt DCK019 19 '' tool bag prompted me to try this smaller , 12 '' DeWalt.This is a great bag for smaller tools such as a scroll saw , palm sander , cord or cordless drills , perhaps smaller 3X21 belt sanders , etc.Anything with a longer handle , such as my 4X24 belt sander , cordless 6 '' circular saw , and DeWalt 5 '' angle grinder are too long or too bulky to fit comfortably , they might squeeze in this bag if placed on the diagonal . For those larger tools , I use the Dewalt 19 '' DCK019 bag.Bag is 12 '' long as advertised , and a very nice 10 '' wide . Leaves lots of room for your accessories , spare batts.Bag open sits about 9 '' high , bag zipped closed is about 5 '' high . So , plan what you intend to carry accordingly.Bag mouth opens FULLY , and remains open with the help of internal wire reinforcing so you wo n't be fighting the bag to get to your tools.Smooth zipper , heavy duty nylon , reinforced webbing runs from the handle continuously under the bag to the opposite handle , and also around the entire perimeter of the bag 's mouth.Stitching seems quite solid , rivets are few but substantial.Bottom is internally reinforced , and flexes some , but in line with the handles , and does not become a bowling ball bag.The `` Feet '' are actually full length skids , not buttons , and also help stiffen the bottom of the bag.In all a great bag for a great price . I plan on getting a few more and `` upgrading '' my older tool cases .	1
good bag . they hold up great . seems to take whatever i throw at it . i have several for my dewalt tools	1
Bought this for my husband Dewalt has high quality tools and this bag is great , husband uses this for his small basic tools this holds a lot and is very durable the zipper works fine and should last along time , Best of all the price was right	1
Nice functional , heavy duty bag I bought a 'gift-wrap ' for a bunch of tools I gave a bride/groom for a shower present .	1
Bought this size bag for my son-in-law , he has many bags but never this sized one so he loves it	1
just toss in your tools tough nylon means no screwdriver or other tool will poke through the sides Stylish and rugged thanks Dewalt	1
This is a well built bag and a great deal for the money . Unfortunately DeWalt has stopped including cases or bags with all their tools . A bad move in my opinion . Who wants to buy a $ 100+ tool and not have anything to put it in to protect it . It looks like I ` ll have to buy another as I just bought a palm router from DeWalt and it too came with no case/bag . Lovely .	1
I purchased this to hold my Dewalt drywall screw gun and Dewalt drywall cut out tool . Neither of these tools came with a case/bag - since both tools are used for installing Sheetrock , etc. , it seemed like a good idea to keep them together . For my use , the bag is barely big enough . The bag is made well .	1
I have multiple Stanley organizer boxes and they are all awesome . I use them for fasteners and they handle the weight and abuse no problem . They 're sturdy and they do n't twist and bend so closing and latching them is never a problem like it can be with cheap versions . I receive compliments on these boxes all the time and I 'm actually planning to purchase more of them . Excellent product .	1
This unit is twice as thick as my other similar storage organizers . What is really nice is that the yellow boxes lift in and out to take only what you need with you . Everything seems real sturdy and rugged . With the extra depth this gets heavy in a hurry . Love it though .	1
I ordered about 30 of these to organize some small things in my shop . It 's rock solid sturdy , stackable , rugged , and portable . HIGHLY recommend , although I do feel like it 's unecessarily expensive given some of the alternatives . However , Amazon has the best price ( I checked everywhere else )	1
Great item to store nails , screws , bolts , nuts , or whatever . Removal compartments makes it easy to carry just one container rather than the whole box . Clear lid allows you to see what is in the box - especially if you have several of these boxes .	1
Without getting too technical , this is a very cool little light . Very small and bright . Quality fit and finish . What makes these different from all others is it contains an accelerometer in it 's micro-computer . Basically the same tech that makes your smart-phone know which way you 're holding it . It has a mode that will go from low to medium to high and back as you point the light from the floor straight down , to 45 degrees , to straight ahead . If you do n't need that mode , you can lock in low/med/high by turning it on facing down , 45 degrees or straight ahead . No buttons , just twist the head . This is my new EDC light . Most people think a 2 lumen maglight solitaire is a what a `` little '' light is . You can blow their minds with this one , ( and temporarily blind them too ) .UPDATE : I forgot I had the light in the pocket of my cargo shorts , and my wife washed them ! It went through a whole cycle in a washing machine ! When she tentatively handed it to me , I twisted it , and on it came . I opened it up and found ZERO moisture or damage ! I would never have tested it this way , but it 's good to know how waterproof it really is .	1
Nice light . Fairly bright . CAUTION do not use with lithium battery . Burnt mine out trying to squeeze more lumins	1
This light is super ! the SENS auto dimmer makes this light a CUT ABOVE THE REST , it spills out an ocean of light and is about the size of your pinky finger , its pushing 120 lumens with a standard alkaline battery but switch to a 14500 Lithium Ion and its pushing out over 200 lumens . A MUST FOR ANY CAMPER OR OUTDOORSMAN ! !	1
What is there not to love ? I already had Nitcores before , so this was a great addition . Simple UI , simple operation . Will work with & # 34 ; used & # 34 ; AA 's too !	1
I 'd give it 3.5 if i could . It 's not as bright as the CR version but it 's still good for a keychain light . It 's easier to activate than the CR ( on which the head is very stiff to turn ) . I prefer the longer/slimmer profile and the more common battery ( so I can save more of my CR123s for my Surefire lights ) . The price is more than reasonable.The auto-dimming is hit or miss depending on what you 're doing . All in all I prefer to control the brightness manually and I could do without it . The times when it 's helpful are outweighed by the times I find it annoying . It 's a novelty more than anything IMO .	1
Ok so first off I 'm a flashaholic , I own quite a few lights of varying quality ( from $ 20 china brand all the way up to big $ $ $ high end customs ) I have been waiting to get this Nitecore SENS to play with it awhile now and let me say I 'm happy I have it , and I will rotate it in my EDC stable , but its got several `` features '' I do n't thing belong on a flashlight.The good-It feels very well made , good quality , great beam profile , feels good in your hand , easy enough to use one handed , the active dimming mode is cool plus the main reason I went with it- the user interface ! The not-so-goodThe `` ramp up '' does n't belong on high mode , on low or medium it 's not bad but when I want high I want it instant , it takes a second or two to reach full brightness , I took off 2 stars just for this but I added one back cause of the stuff I like so much.It 's not 190lumens ! It 's barley brighter than my 120lumen single AA L3 illumination L10 I carry everywhere on my keychain , that 's a BIG DISAPPOINTMENT ! I would make an educated guess its about 160 lumens ( its about equal to my streamlight TRL-1S ) on high with a fresh CR123 . The TIR ( total intigrated reflector , an optic , not a real reflector ) is nice , I have a few lights with them instead of typical reflectors and I actually prefer the beams of the TIR optic type , the corona ( hot spot ) is perfect , no useless spill area.The bottom line-I bought this light for one reason , most small twist interface lights make you cycle threw all the modes each time ( low-off-medium-off-high-off etc ... ) and most start on low , with the SENS you can start in the mode you choose each time . That 's a huge advantag over most twisty lights , ( check out the Thrunite Ti for another awesome different twisty UI- twist on for low , twist FARTHER for high , no back-n-fourth crap-NEW Arrival ThruNite Ti 2 Flashlight , Cree XP-G2 LED , 81 lumen , OP reflector , Waterproof to IPX-8 , Blue color ) The active dimming is very useful too , low is plenty of light for walking and all you have to do for more light is aim the light at something farther away.Ill rate it in order of my EDC favorites-1.my custom built 3xAAA , XP-G2 , 5 mode light I built myself2.L3 illumination L10 ( I have the Nichia 219 version , wife has the XP-G2 version ) no matter what other light I 'm carrying in my pocket my 219 version L10 stays on my keys at all times3 . This Nitecore SENS CR4 . Streamlight polytac with high CRI emitter swap .	1
Nitecore SENS CR light at 190 lumens is a great light for any use . I have tested its usefulness good out to around 45-60 yards . Once you have it closed up with a fresh CR123 battery , it 's good to go . Does what it is supposed to -- I find the Adaptive Dimming Technology somewhat gimmicky and just prefer to use either the medium or high setting on constant . I do n't completely discount the ADT though ... it does have it 's uses . This is a good small and solid light . The only downside is their TIR ( total internal reflection ) lens is not what I was fully expecting but it still does a good job getting the light out there ( suppose Surefire has spoiled me on that front with their TIR technology but you Sure pay for theirs ! ) . All in all , I would recommend this light to others as a solid and reliable backup light ( esp . if one carries a primary light with CR123 batteries )	1
I ignored the SENS series for a while until I realized that besides the active dimming mode , you can also manually turn on the light in whatever mode you like . That little feature is the most clever innovation since the invention of the multi-mode twisty light . The angle-sensing active dimming feature is cool to play around with , and is useful when walking outdoors at night , but my favorite feature is that I no longer have to twist the light on and off multiple times to get to a specific mode . I rarely have the need for high mode , and usually the low mode is bright enough for everyday use . But regardless of what mode you prefer , you can get to it directly from the OFF position , and this user interface becomes quite intuitive after a few days.Some other things I like : * The output modes are evenly spaced , with each mode being about 3x the output of the lower one . Whatever the situation might be , I can find an output level that 's appropriate for the conditions . * The lens and the emitter produce a useful wide hotspot , with a floody corona that gradually tapers off . But unlike a traditional reflector , the TIR lens does n't cause the hotspot to be have a greenish color compared to the peripheral illumination . * The beam tint is a nice cool white , without any nasty purple , blue , green or yellow hues . It 's a cooler white than a Fenix E05 for example , but white nonetheless , and works well for picking out small or low contrast details . * The usual rugged waterproof construction found in quality lights* Regulated constant brightness* Battery usage and efficiency is very good compared to similar compact CR123 lights.Potential issues and problems : * My sample initially required the head to be loosened too far in order to turn off the light , almost to the point of exposing the o-ring . That was promptly fixed by flattening out the leaf spring at the tail end of the body . * The thread movement was not smooth , but applying some lube quickly solved that problem . * When you turn on the light in low or medium mode , it gradually fades in to the specified output , taking about 2 seconds . This may be useful in some cases , but I find it more of an annoyance . Not a big deal since I 'm not using the light numerous times throughout the day , but it may be a problem for other users . Good thing on high mode it comes on much quicker.I had high expectations for the SENS CR , and other than these minor issues , the light does everything I expected .	1
Easy installation . Replaced a very expensive faucet that did not last . Yes , it is plastic , but you will never know it when mounted . Made in Israel by some pretty smart cookies . At least it was n't from China like most expensive models today .	1
We got this to replace our 2 lever laundry faucet . The lever feels a little odd when opening to the full position . I guess we 're just used to a little more angle when you pull the lever . The hose is not metal but for this price , its a pretty good buy ; considering that you 'll probably spend around $ 90- $ 110 for a similar one at your local lowes/home depot .	1
I purchased this for our camper as a faucet replacement for a standard faucet with NO sprayer ! If you spend any time at all in your camper and prepare meals , you 'll appreciate the value of having a sprayer not to mention being able to extend to fill taller pots or jugs . Works great and installed beautifully with no leaks and has a modern sleek look for updating . Shipped fast	1
This is an excellent Fossett for the price . Looks great and functions beautifully.Simple and easy to follow instructions makes this perfect for any DIY project	1
This is a solid faucet made of tough plastic and works very well when installed properly . I see some very negative reviews here , but I think a lot of the reported problems are the result of incorrect installation ( which is a bit tricky , more on that later ) .The faucet has a high neck without being insanely bulky , and can be installed with or without baseplate ( three hole or single hole sink ) . It has a pull-out sprayer with jet and shower mode adjustable via a switch on top . The sprayer hose is very long- good for a large sink . Control is via a side lever- up and down is temperature and sideways adjusts volume . A lot of newer faucets use this style of control and it 's actually pretty nice once you get used to it.The whole thing is constructed of hard white plastic which is an incredibly tough material . It is held together with metal bolts that screw into the base and washers , and a counterweight for the hose . Rubber washers are provided for the faucet assembly and base.Installation is a bit on the difficult side for this one , especially compared to some more traditional faucets I 've put in . The kit includes all necessary attachments and hoses , but the instructions are a bit hard to comprehend . It 's mostly pictorial and the parts are marked with codes on the graphics , but not on the parts themselves . Additionally , some of the graphic steps are a bit obtuse and simply hard to see due to being too small . A lot of the assembly was trial and error on my part , and took about an hour . Forget a washer and you 'll likely figure it out when you get a geyser upon turning it on . You 'll need a phillips screwdriver to attach the weight , a wrench for the bolts , and some plumber 's putty for the base.Once done , it works very well and looks nice . Since it 's all plastic , it wo n't rust or corrode which in my experience is the main cause of leaks in these things . Especially for the cost , which is 1/3-1/4 the cost of many similar 'known brand ' models , this is a really good faucet .	1
A spring-powered manual staple gun is n't going to have the power of an air-powered one . That 's just reality . But for light duty work , they 're really handy . You do n't have to lug in the compressor or hose . Just load up the manual stapler and go to work.The one in this kit works fine . I just installed some insulation and vapor barrier with it . Using short staples , like the 1/4-inch ones that come with the set , is key to getting good results . All the staples sank in nicely . I did n't have to use a hammer to tap in a single one.The stapling pliers are great for closing paper bags . I remember the days when most every retailer had stapling pliers like this at the checkout counter . The heaviest paper bags could be stapled closed with them -- and the receipt attached at the same time.They 're good for any paper stapling job . They generate a lot of power because of the leverage.As I said in the title , it 's a good set , versatile and useful .	1
This combination set pliers stapler and staple gun is a good choice for someone who needs both these tools for light duty work . Both staplers come with a box of several thousand staples . Each tool uses a different size staple so keep that in mind if you want to maximize interchangeability of your tools . The pliers stapler works well with thick stacks of papers . The gun is designed for working with thin wood and cardboard or fabric -- those doing upholstery work would find the gun very useful . Both the tools are extremely well made and finished but keep in mind they are only designed for light duty work . If you work with thicker material , you need a heavier duty staple gun.The set is relatively expensive for someone who only needs one of the tools . I expect they can be purchased separately and that is the most economical approach for the person who does n't need the combination . Considering the build quality of the items , the price is reasonable . These tools should last a very long time if used for their purposes . I tested both tools in various materials and found them to be easy to use and perform as advertised . While they do not include any instructions per se , a very basic diagram for each tool shows how to load staples . The pliers stapler uses a long coil spring that has to fold into itself in places as you push the plunger into the tools when loading . It requires a little effort but , once installed , the feeding of the staples was perfect.Overall , I like the individual tools a lot . I would give them 5-stars individually . As a combination kit , they may be overkill for the price . But if both tools are what you need , they would be a very good choice .	1
You know , I really love the quality and build of both these staplers , but I do n't think selling them in a package really makes much sense . One comes with really light staples and must be used for upholstery , or perhaps guiding wires . The other , the smaller one , is for stapling huge amounts of paper . Both are fantastic , but they are used for entirely different purposes , and , more importantly , they use completely different staples . In fact , when I installed the large staples in the small one I forgot I had received different staples for the big one -- I just presumed the big staples must also fit the big one . So after five minutes of fruitless attempts at loading the staples I realized my mistake . Ohhhhhh , the large stapler must use smaller staples , and they were back in my drawer ... Anyway , the small stapler is rather amazing . At work I use the regular office stapler -you know , the one you have to slam down to staple as hard as you can if you are stapling 20 pages . This one , however , is amazing . It staples MAGAZINES ! ! ! ! It took hardly any effort , and it stapled way better than any stapler I 'd used before.On the other hand , the large stapler is not quite as impressive , though it is also high quality . It works well , and it does the job , but the small staples being stapled are just not as impressive , and , honestly , I will probably use this a lot less than the other one.Finally , loading the small stapler takes a little bit of elbow grease ; you have to really compress a tight spring to do it . It was n't something impossible , it was just one of those things where you are doing it and you wonder , hmmm , do I really compress it that much ? Well , you do , and it works fine once you realize that.Overall , each of these is really top-notch , lightweight , sold metal , and easy to use . I would definitely buy the small stapler ( that staples magazines together ! ) but might wait on purchasing the larger one because I wo n't have as many uses for it . If you need a lightweight staple gun , though , this is not a bad option . Recommended .	1
I had a Craftsman staple gun and I got this , because of the low price , to replace it . It works fine , but it feels lighter and cheaper so I ca n't comment on how long it will last . It has been a few months and a few hundred staples . I use it for stapling wood in furniture repairs .	1
I tried the stapling pliers out on increasingly thick stacks of paper , and was slightly surprised by the smoothness with which it worked . In fact , the first few times I had to check to see if a staple had been used , because it sure felt like I just clicked empty . The staples went in easily , and each time had a good tight form , none of that crooked or loose form that a poor stapling job shows.I tried the staple gun on some medium-soft wood , and once again I was impressed by the smooth effortless ease with which it worked . I 'd try it on harder wood , I think it will work fine as long as I use the right staples for the job.The only minor complaint I have with the package is that it 's not immediately obvious which staples go with which tool -- the widths are different , so it does become obvious once you look at the staples . I also did n't like the way the pliers loaded , but that 's just personal.Despite that minor grumble , I can recommend these tools : they work well , and seem to be very well made . I 'm probably being too harsh with just 4 stars , they 're at least 4.5 .	1
I could n't quite figure out the necessity of having to have both of these staplers until I started to look up different ones of comparable quality with the staples included . I realized that this was a fairly good deal and finally after using them I can see the possibilities of having both styles around at all times.I do heavy duty Christmas decorating and even some minor upholstery so having the gun handy is wonderful for me . It is very well made , looks like it will take years of punishment . It is going to come in handy for many sorts of household projects . The handle is relatively easy to squeeze for me and that is saying something because I have a bit of a weak grip.The staple pliers is sort of a misnomer for the uninitiated like I was . What it is is something like a desk stapler but one that you hold in your hand . This also has a very smooth ratchet motion and again is well made for someone with a bit of a weak grip . I managed to staple with ease approximately 50 pages at a time.They are both quite easy to load.Includes R23 Fine Wire Stapling GunIncludes 1 Box 1/4-Inch Fine Wire StaplesIncludes 1 K1 Classic PliersIncludes 1 Box of 5/16-Inch StaplesAll You need in 1 Combo Kit	1
I am always working on one craft project or another , so this set of staplers comes in handy for me . The larger one is a staple gun . Can be used for lightweight things , nothing extremely heavy duty . The other is a squeeze type stapler for regular use on materials like paper . Works fine . They are sturdy and well made . The directions for loading and using are practically non-existent . They have three tiny illustrations which , to me , are very unclear . No words telling you how to load them at all . I 'm usually pretty efficient at getting things to work , but these took me a while to understand how to load them -- they could definitely include a couple of sentences explaining instructions . After fiddling with them for a while , I figured them out . Maybe you 'll understand quicker than I did ! There are two boxes of staples included in the set . They are standard type staples , not the heavy ones you 'd normally use with a staple gun . I wish the stapler had a longer reach to get in the center of projects , but otherwise it works fine for normal stapling jobs . Overall , I 'm happy with this product . Handy to have around .	1
The staplers , made in Sweden , include a staple gun for thin material and upholstery and a hand stapler for thick stacks , etc . These are high quality staplers and will do almost anything you can imagine using a stapler for around the home or office . The set include a box of 5000 5/16 '' staples , made in France , and a box of 5000 1/4 '' staples , manufactured in China . These heavy duty products will not disappoint and the Rapid 90062 Combo Kit is practical and useful .	1
These are both well made , and work well . The stapler is heavier duty than the run of the mill units found in offices . The staple gun is lighter duty than Arrow T50 type , but will work fine for tacking signs , roofing felt , etc . The soft grip on it is a nice feature . I have n't experienced any jams or malfunctions . Made in Sweden .	1
I love the look of both staplers ... a little retro except for the bit of plastic molding around the finger grip of the staple gun . These are both made in Sweden and feel like high quality tools that may have been invented almost two centuries ago but are precision machines that work with ease.The stapling pliers are great for continuous work or whenever you need to staple up to about 70 pages , with surprisingly little effort concerning the height of the stack . Powerful.The staple gun is for light duty . I 've got several others that can take larger staples but none are as easy to use.I 've used them both quite a bit ( I 've had one of the staple guns for years ) and neither has ever jammed . That 's what 's important to me . I hate cars that need repaired ( only `` repair '' on my Prius after 100,000 miles has been a lightbulb ) and I hate staplers that jam . These do n't .	1
This review is from : Rapid 20510450 R23 Fine Wire Stapling Gun ( Tools & Home Improvement ) A giant step forward . This is not grandma 's nickel-98 staple gun from the five & dime.I was elated when I discovered this stapler was Made in Sweden . I 've used Swedish products since 1980 . They are known worldwide for their quality craftsmanship and durability.I have 3 professional Husqvarna chainsaws , 181SE , 285XP , 372XP and a 327HE3X hedge trimmer and I 've never had a problem in 30 years . The Tormek T-7 sharpening system in my workshop is used daily.A mere 12 pounds of grip force is all that 's required to operate this quality-built staple gun . That 's effortless and makes it perfect for light-duty jobs in the office , schools , restaurants or any environment which requires frequent stapling . It 's great for tacking up posters , yard sale and `` I 'm getting out of Dodge '' signs on the corner utility pole.In comparison , my Arrow T-50 staplers in the workshop require 38 pounds of force to fire which might tire some folks out before they got to the 3rd utility pole.I 've used the Rapid R23 for two months without a jam or problem . It 's fast and smooth and the best such stapler I 've ever owned . Now , I do n't have to run get the big gun for small jobs.See my uploaded image to see how to load staples.The 5/16 '' staples drop in from the bottom and are locked into place by the push rod . No effort required ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... .This review is from : Rapid Classic 1 Plier Stapler - Boxed ( 90119 ) ( Office Product ) A giant step forward . This is not grandma 's nickel-98 stapler from the five & dime.A mere 11 pounds of grip force is all that 's required to operate this quality-built stapler . That 's effortless and makes it perfect for home office , schools , restaurants or any environment that requires frequent stapling.I 've used it for two months without a jam or problem . It 's fast and smooth and the best such stapler I 've ever owned.See my uploaded image to see how to load staples.After inserting a full load of staples , it takes a fair amount of force to lock rear hook on the spring pusher rod into place to secure the staples . Most springs become weak with time so this is a good thing.The 1/4 '' ( 6mm ) staples are perfect for most jobs.If you need bigger staples , you might need to get a bigger gun .	1
I give this set maximum credit for being so well-made . I have a stapling plier right next to my desk that was made in the USA and works brilliantly . The pair in this set seems to work just as well.One thing that made it easy to load was to load half instead of an entire strip of staples . Then ba-boom , beautiful stapling right from the start.The staple gun I needed my husband 's help to test , because my rheumatoid arthritis makes such a tool beyond my physical ability to handle . It worked terrifically , and I suspect it will be using it quite a bit around the house . I think his tool chest will be a good place for it . Maybe in some kind of box , so it wo n't accidentally get triggered ! This is a good set . Would also be good to sell each tool with a box of the right staples for that tool , so people could buy just the one they know they need . It 's very possible they 'll later buy the other one , too . These are really good . Not heavy duty , but quite well made .	1
This is a combo set with stapling pliers ( essentially the more traditional stapler style where the top squeezes down onto the bottom to bend the staples under but can handle more papers in a thicker stack than most traditional staplers ) and a staple gun ( which has no bottom and is used to shoot the staples into something where it will not come out the other side , say onto bulletin boards , a telephone pole , upholstery , etc . ) .If you need both , this is a great combo set . Each comes with a large box of staples to get you going . However , it is important to note that they do not use the same type of staples - the staples in the staple gun are more heavy duty for such applications and the staples for the staple pliers are more traditional staples . The advantage to the staple pliers is that it will go through a much thicker stack of papers than your traditional stapler . ( However , I can see that if you were doing bunches of thick paper stacks it could really start to make your hand ache , whereas if it were a 'press down onto a table style ' more like a traditional stapler there would be less chance of this ) These do not come with instructions , but they are pretty intuitive and there is a diagram on each to show how to load your staples , which is a pretty easy procedure.All-in-all they seem very well made , not likely to break easily , are easy to use , and work as you 'd expect . A good set if you need both a staple gun and staple pliers .	1
The staplers are very high quality . One 's great for paper , even rather thick stacks , while the other is very well designed industrial use . I lined a closet with aromatic cedar using it ( had to buy longer staples than the ones in the package but that 's no knock on this bundle ) . I 've only had them a couple months , but used them hard and believe the will last a very long time . Solid stuff at a reasonable price . Recommended .	1
This is a must have for any household . It is sturdy . I have used it from everything to put up Christmas lights to stapling large stacks of paper . I love the fact that Esselte has bundled two staplers together at one low cost , plus they provide one box of stapes for each unit . The combo will come in handy for any homeowner . The staple gun can handle sheetrock to hardwood . If you do n't have a good stapler or staple gun in your house , I highly recommend that you buy this Combo Kit .	1
At first I did n't see the need for both staplers , until I started using them around the house . This is a great double pack that offers some great products for one price . The staple gun was super useful for furniture , and the stapling pliers were great around the office . Both serve excellent purposes , and seem to be made extremely well . Plus , they both come with the appropriate staples , so no wandering around Lowes or trying to find the right size .	1
This two-pack has a heavy duty paper stapler and an upholstery gun . Both are lightweight yet feel well-made . I had been using my old Stanley upholstery gun , and I also have an electric gun , but I wanted something more lightweight that was also more reliable than the Stanley ( which jams ALL THE TIME ) .I took the gun out to my barn and hung up several horse blankets which I use to insulate my work room when the weather gets cold . Each staple went in easily and completely and there was no jamming -- I used about 30 staples in total . These went through a thick blanket and into the 2x12s without any problem.I have n't had any need for the hand stapler yet , but I did test it out on several old magazines and it had no problem going through even a National Geographic . It also goes through fabric , but only if you want to staple it together , as opposed to attach it to something else.Well made and smooth working products .	1
I 'm an office supply junkie and use staples in some of my crafts.Both of these are easy to load and reliable , and the set comes with full boxes of staples to load them.The staple gun is a smaller size than my husband 's , and not as heavy duty . It does work well in my small hands . For upholstery , I 'll still use his heavy duty staple gun , but for wreath making and crafts , this is my preferred gun now . It 's so much easier to use ! The pliers are wonderful . They take high capacity staples to staple lots of paper together , and work great for little notepads and other things . It does n't take a hand hurting amount of pressure to work them . They will get used frequently , and I will recommend the pliers to friends .	1
This combo kit is great since it gives you two different size staples to use and two tools to use them with , the gun and the pliers . It pliers are good for large reams of paper that will break or jam an ordinary stapler and the gun is good for soft woodand cloth if you are doing some upholstery work . I like them for craft work with wire and soft wood . They are n't impossible to squeeze as some of the heavy duty staple guns are for smaller or weaker hands . I 'm glad I got this kit .	1
This package gives you two very different staplers and literally ten thousand staples . One is a pair of `` stapling pliers . '' From what I 've read , about half the population uses desk staplers that way anyway . I have no idea if that statistic is true , but stapling a large stack of papers while holding them can be less awkward than using a desk model . I started off with a stack of thirty pages , and the stapler worked well with minimum force and complete tautness . With some staplers , you can get a `` loose '' result or staples with the ends not completely down.The package seems to be saying that the pliers can handle up to 50 pages . There 's a 50 next to the picture of the staple , and typically Swedes are not big on instructions . I tried with 50 sheets of paper , and it took more force than before . Or perhaps I kept pressing because it felt like I had n't finished . The stapler worked , with barely enough staple sticking through to hold the stack of pages . If you routinely staple stacks of 50 pages , I 'd recommend something more robust . But if you typically staple between two and 35-40 pages , this will work well and still handle 50 in a pinch.The other stapler is typical in design for staple guns , but atypical in my experience in the size staples it takes . The sizes listed on the box indicate the staple depth , but the width is a determining factor in whether it will fit . I do n't know how easy it is to find that size ( the other size is standard in the US and Canada ) but 5000 staples will last me quite a long time for needed applications.The staple gun I use most often is anArrow T-50M Staple Gun Tacker . It 's bigger , more powerful , uses larger staples , and works well . The only down side is that if you do n't hold the stapler firmly , it 's possible for the staple to not go in all the way . For some tasks , you simply need a smaller stapler . This one fits the bill very well . This stapler works very well , has no kick back , and staples will go in completely with no effort . I 'm in the middle of reupholstering a chair and this uses the right size staples and has no trouble penetrating wood or particle board . My alternative would have been to use a desk stapler `` opened up '' which would have been awkward , required two hands , and not worked as well . Having this staple gun is a great addition for when you need a gun for smaller staples , and will also work well for tasks such as stapling papers to the wall or bulletin boards . Although it might seem like overkill to have a staple gun for that purpose , consider the situation when you are trying to staple a poster to the wall , would like to keep your hand on it , but need to hold the stapler with one hand while pressing the top with the other . The next time you have to do it , you will be thankful if you have this staple gun instead of a desktop stapler.Having a tool that will staple things to other objects and one that will staple a moderately large stack of papers together will cover a lot of bases . Having 5000 staples for each may last a long time , especially for home use . The price is reasonable when you consider the cost of getting these separately . Considering the versatility , I 'd recommend it . Sooner or later you will have a need for both .	1
I repair copy machines for a living . It has really been nice to not breath in all the chemicals from canned air . I carry both in my bag but have not used the canned air since I started carrying the O2 system . I have even suggested that we replace our canned air with this unit . My machines are cleaner and I can use it at any angle . Try doing that with canned air.It is now April and I ca n't say enough good things about this system . I can use it upside down , sideways or even right side up . This makes it handy when trying to get into tights spots that canned air ca n't always reach . I find that I only charge it about once a month and it goes all month . I can not tell that there is much loss in pressure over time .	1
I love this tool I wish they would 've invented it 10 years ago I hate canned air and the dangerous gas and the cans that freeze when this one wears out by another one .	1
Save money ; portable , does n't get cold , does n't freeze up , always have canned air on hand ( real air ) , rechargeable , not dangerous to humans or the environment , kids ca n't get high from it , the price is equal to eight or so cans of liquid compressed gas ( gas not air ) sold in stores giving a good and fast return on investment . Read all the warnings on store bought cans , then read the warnings on the Hurricane , they 're are n't any .	1
This is what you want if you are serious about fixing all your gadgets - Put this in your gadget fixing tool arsenal .	1
Gave this set 4 out of 5 due to the case - the driver is made well out of aluminum the bits also weemwell made but the case is made poorly and will break with daily use - would recomend if this item was on sale .	1
Starting off with the cons , the case is a little cheap . Now on to the pros , this tool has everything you need for small electronic repair . It is extremely high quality . All my life I have been stunted by not having the right tool for the job , and now I can do anything , Lol . The bits are n't standard 1/4 in bits allowing you to fit into small spaces . The flexible shaft is another plus allowing you to get just about anywhere , and the center of the shaft stays still for you to hold just turning the ends , very convenient . I would recommend this product to any technician or do-it-youselfer !	1
Quality tools from quality materials and nice fit and finish . They sent me a set with a cracked tray , they corrected this but it took some time .	1
With electronics , i always have the problem of not having a philips small enough so i have to use a flathead and end up stripping one of the screws . Not anymore , this kit has every tool i would need and some i dont think i would ever use . Its great to have for anyone who likes to fix their own stuff . I cant recommend it enough .	1
Overall the driver kit is wonderful . I read many other reviews where people had issues with missing bits , or bits with rust on them ( from the Pro kit ) . As a result when I got my kit I reviewed each one with a magnifying loop and not a single issue , every bit was perfect and clean . So for me , I 'm saying the set of 4mm bits are all great . The driver itself is nice . It has a good weight , and a very solid feel and the o-rings provide a point of grip , but it is a bit lacking , a full round rubber section would be preferred . I think the o-rings were chosen for aesthetics over function.The included extension fits in the hole on the end of the driver to create a T-bar for added torque , which can be helpful since you ca n't always get a lot of leverage with these types of drivers.The palm spinner also works nice , I have had no issues with it getting caught or sticking . I have also found that these bit work perfectly with theGeneral Tools 500 Cordless Precision Screwdriverand getting that with this set really is a great match.The bits themselves are not magnetic but the driver has a strong magnet to hold the bit in . As a result the bit , when in the driver , carries this charge and the bit will have a slight magnetic charge which is generally a very helpful thing and will allow it to still pick up small screws . The added magnetic bit is also very nice to have . I have n't really had much use for the flexible extension bar . Its decent quality , but a bit hard to turn with an angle over 45 degrees from what I can see.This may seem really nit-picky but in all honesty my biggest issue is with the white plastic base . With the quality and precision that went into this kit , and its not a cheap $ 10 kit . The Driver kit pieces all sit in a very thin , cheap as hell , white plastic mold . Just seems that an extra dollar or 2 to make the setting a bit more solid would have been what made this perfect . It has n't broke on my yet and it may hold up , but it really adds a bit of a cheap feel to the whole thing.Overall i do really like the kit and would recommend it , especially as a companion to theGeneral Tools 500 Cordless Precision Screwdriver , as all of the 4mm bits are interchangeable . **If you found this review helpful please click the button below	1
This set has come in very handy . When ever I come across a screw head that is either small or some weird head that I have know idea what it is this set has come through for me .	1
I bought this because of the triangle bit for some mac products . It has a lot of bits the only reason i did n't give it a 5 is because of the price . It 's not american made so i do n't know why the cost is so high . When it comes to tools you get what you pay for at this price i would think it would be made in the USA .	1
This headlamp is only 150 lumens according to the box . I compared it with my Fenix PD20 ( I think that 's the model number ) which is 180 lumens and it looks very slightly dimmer . It also is a cooler white than the PD20 . The light does n't seem that bad but I feel bamboozled that it only has half the lumen rating in the description .	-1
I like a good product that makes it easy to clear my drains but this is not that product . I still like my cheap snake or plastic jagged zip its . I never really figured this one out .	-1
This 'snake ' was n't long enough for my sink 's drain , and did n't seem to work for the shower drain either . $ 3 of Drano did do the job .	-1
too small and I would not recommend this to anyone , short , not long enough and I 'm sending it back tomorrow .	-1
This mini-snake was completely useless and landed in the trash very quickly . I called the plumber who opened my drain in about 10 minutes with a real snake . Do n't bother with this one .	-1
It was good while it lasted but it started flickering and then going off intermittently . Is this why Amazon no longer carries this bulb ?	-1
My original review is at the end of this one and although these started off great , within three months they started failing and now they are all done . Also a thing I noticed is that this particular brand has a residual glow when you turn off the lights . Did n't notice this `` feature '' in the ones in an open room until we turned them off late in the evening and they continued to have a blue glow to them for about a minute or so . Weird . Like I said in the original review , the color and brightness were great.I am not sure how they calculate estimates of the life of the bulb , but these , to a bulb , performed worse that any similar incandescent bulb and way , way worse than other CFL bulbs we have of same wattage and placement.Original review : I have had these a week now and they are excellent . The color is superb , the brightness is unbelievable and it is so nice to walk into the room and not have to wait for the CFLs to warm up so you can find your was around ! Have not tried to dim them but they are a great replacement for the CFL recessed lights !	-1
Original review : These work exactly as promised . When I rearranged my bedroom furniture , my beside table ( and lamp ) no longer fit by the bed . Proximity was n't an issue since my Kindle Fire HD 7 '' means I do n't need focused light for reading , but it was a pain having to get up to shut off the light when I was ready for sleep . Now , I can use the remote from anywhere in my two level home and control any one of three lamps , which is a wonderful convenience . That said , each controller takes up an entire outlet , and it only comes with one remote - a remote that is near impossible to pry open in order to swap batteries . I finally had to use a sharp knife to wedge the battery compartment open at serious risk of personal injury.Product suggestions that would make a functional product truly stellar : - Add a second , pass-through outlet- If possible , make the remote thinner via use of watch-type coin batteries- Design a better battery compartment cover so people can swap batteries without risking dismemberment- Offer the ability to purchase additional remotesUpdate : I originally rated this 4 stars , but downgraded to two because one of the outlet units failed after only two months . Unfortunately , I assumed it was merely a weak remote battery reducing the distance the signal could travel ( and did n't want to wrestle with opening that awful battery door ) and stalled a few months - at which point I plugged it back in and discovered the outlet was in fact defective . I have an e-mail in to Etekcity , and will upgrade the number of stars again depending upon the support I receive ; even with my delays , I 've only owned this for six months , and the product should last longer than that .	-1
The flashlight broke off when I adjusted the light angle , just broke off ! So now I have a useless light , tripod is obviously cheaply made plastic or it would n't have broke .	-1
Light stays on for only 10 sec . Too short . It is supposed to be 30 sec . Sending it back tomorrow	-1
After just 3 months , the red , blinking light appeared which supposedly means the 4 batteries need to be replaced ; however , after replacing them , the red light still blinks although the lights are brighter . When changing the batteries , I noticed one of the battery terminals is rusty . That should n't happen .	-1
Only received 1 and not a pair . Not Amazon fault ; Amico needs to have better QC , S/B a pair ( 2 ) in the package ! Quality of the 1 received was poor . You get what you pay for ; they were cheap !	-1
The retaining nut broke the first time I tightened it . I installed the bit and snugged the nut down by hand except the nut just kept spinning and would not tighten down.Also the power switch sometimes has to be toggled several times to get it to turn on.I am not at all impressed .	-1
I ordered this Genesis GRT2103-40 VS Rotary Tool with 40 Accessories , Grey but it came with a bad switch so I will need to send it back .	-1
I bought this item thinking it was a pressure SWITCH in which , you would press it once , and the light would stay on , but NO ! It 's a pressure PAD in which you have to keep it pressed down for your light to stay on . This is false advertisement and a rip off . I was mislead into purchasing this thinking it was going to do exactly what the title of this product says .	-1
This & # 34 ; works & # 34 ; to turn my rifle mounted light once . Then after a few minutes it can turn the light back off . Very poor product made with flawed components.I gave it two stars because it & # 34 ; works & # 34 ; and was cheap .	-1

I was using it for a week and it started to leak at the bottom . So disappointed , I can not even return it now .	-1
The filter is good and the one-click thing is nice and when it was not leaking , it was great . But the faucet adapter is made of plastic and degrades over time ( and not much time ) . After 6 weeks , it started leaking . First it was just a drip but over 2 weeks evolved to water spraying out and up . The adapter is on tight and the gasket is good and I used teflon tape . The problem seems to be that the adapter is degrading where it meets the filter unit and losing plastic . As a result , water comes out from the fitting . I have contacted PUR but I also found that there are a lot of complaints of this . Supposedly they have a new metal one , which should do the trick , but until I see it and see it works , this review stands .	-1
Very , very weak light to serve any use at all . Put one in my safe and the motion sensor does not turn on . I had to set to manual mode and even when on , so weak LED . STAY AWAY ... ... .WASTE OF MONEY !	-1
I 've owned several Gerber knifes in the past . Even though they 've never been known as top quality , Gerber usually make a product worth owning , this one barely qualifies.It will definitely come in handy but I would n't trust it under much pressure . The metal is very flimsy especially the blade lock . It also does n't close flush , one side is higher when it is closed.Made in China	-1
Thats the reason I ordered it and not pick up a Chinese made GFCI . Of course when I received it , its stamped & # 34 ; MADE IN CHINA & # 34 ; . Amazon needs to get its act together .	-1
Where is the quality control in China ? ? ? ? Like most things I order on Amazon , I 'm guaranteed that I 'll have to return such garbage . In this case it 's 1 out of 4 . I 'll update this after a week of running the functioning lights .	-1
The product came on time , nice packaging . I bought 2 and both of them initially worked fine . On the second day , 1 of the light stopped working , I placed it in an area with a good sunlight . Then the following day , it worked again and then on the 4rth day , it finally stopped working so I decided to return it	-1
I have owned a Dorcy 41-1071 , which is also called `` Mr beams MB 360 light '' , for about 18 months . The MB360 requires 3 D batteries . But the batteries lasted 16 months , before I replaced them.The MB 360 costs less . The MB360 has a motion sensor that is much more powerful than the one on this light . I had to be within 3 feet of this Hipe 16 LED light to get the motion light to come on . Even the instructions only claim that it will work within 2 meters , which is just over 6 ft . I personally tried 4 ft and it did not come on , I had to move to 3 ft range , which is very close.The light on the MB360 is brighter . Do n't be fooled like I was by the marketing trick of `` 16 led lights '' ... ..they are microscopic and are all powered by a single AA battery.I was disappointed in this product . Here is what you should consider.This light is powered by a single , rechargeable AA battery . Compare that to 3 D batteries on the MR Beams.This light needs sun exposure to work , but then says in the instructions that it needs to be protected from water . Hmmmm . I have n't figured that one out . I tried to mount it to the house , where it was protected by the eaves but still have exposure to sunlight . Easier said than done , worked with limited success . I am going to have to move it out where it gets more exposure to the sun . Maybe someone wants to comment on where you mounted yours and can it take heavy rain exposure ? Your location of this light is very limited by the 7 hours of sun exposure a day the instructions recommend . The MB360 goes anywhere.The only possible reason to buy this light is that it is solar . However , why not buy the Mr Beams and use rechargeable batteries in it ?	-1
Purchased this item Feb 2014 and installed it in master bedroom closet . A few weeks ago , the light started coming on intermittently thus allowing enough light through a small crack in the closet door to wake me at night . First I thought maybe a power surge was creating the problem ; that was not the case . Then I turned the light switch off for a few days hoping the light bulb may somehow 'recycle ' ( sic ) ; that did n't help . This was in a pack of two ( $ 10.95 ) and so far the other light bulb is working as it should . Very unhappy about spending $ 5 + for a light bulb which only gave me three months of utility .	-1
the momentary on only function is pretty overrated . I would have preferred momentary + on and off . oh well , should be okay for an emergency camping/searchlight .	-1
Update 03/12/13 - The switch was on this morning when it should be off and it did not show up in the WeMo app . It rained last night ; I did n't think the power went out as the the stove and microwave clocks looked normal , as well as the PC and TV . A little poking in the WeMo app - a couple of tries to search for the switch , but nothing found and it did not show up in Wi-Fi Settings . So I reset by unplugging from the AC outlet , holding the button down and keeping it down while plugging back in . Go to the WeMo app , but nothing there . Go to Wi-Fi Settings , it took two iterations , but then WeMo showed up in Wi-Fi Settings . Here is a counter intuitive part : you select WeMo in Wi-Fi Settings ( check mark appears ) and close settings . One might think I 'm no longer connected to the home network , but keep the faith and go to the WeMo app . It searches for the switch , gives me my home network login for the WEP password and crashes once . Open and try the password again - this time it takes . Re-enable my previously set up Rule and I 'm good to go . Taking away another start.Original comments : There was a time in between Windows 2000 and Windows 7 ( Vista seemed like a waste ) when we said set up for Apple products `` just worked '' . Not so for the WeMo . Yes , the FAQs say it may take multiple login attempts to connect to the Wi-Fi , but it does n't talk about the loss of blood from banging your head on the desk hoping it would work this time . Add insult , the iPhone app just closed sometimes . I 'm connecting to a plain Jane Verizon Fios router and it did finally work . And yes , it 's cool to turn the switch on and off from my desk in the other room ( kind of why I bought it and the blood has finally clotted on my forehead ) . I 've set up my first rule and we 'll see how it works . Ca n't wait for the horror stories about resetting after power outages - ca n't they store the settings in ROM ? Maybe they 've fixed that . I 'll try to report back .	-1
Bought this unit for the wireless value . It does what it is supposed to . There is no problem with the product function . Over priced for what it is and does . Cumbersome , that one has to call up the control app on the smart phone to on or off the circuit . Replaced it with a cheap IR sender/receiver outlet . $ 50 for this and $ 20 for a set of 3 IR receiver/outlets and a sender pad .	-1
I plugged it in the same room as my wireless router and it worked great ! But moved it to the next room and it ca n't connect to my wireless ! The range is horrible ( but the idea is great ) !	-1
Completely unreliable . I am a software developer and tech savvy person and I found this device utterly frustrating and ultimately worthless . I had to re-program it many times due to it failing in one way or another . Once programmed , it was not always reachable , even when I was in the same building , let alone trying to access it remotely . Completely not ready for prime time . It 's like a really bad prototype that would not encourage confidence that the team could actually make a real one . Grade : zero . The product *idea* is good . Let us know if yu ever actually make one .	-1
I bought a two pack of these at BJ Wholesale yesterday and returned it today . Set up was easy and seemless . I hooked up both WeMos in no time , loaded the app to my IPhone and my IPad , played with it for a few minutes ( lights on , lights off , radio on , radio off ) , and left it alone until my wife got home . When she got home I wanted to show her what a cool security product I 'd bought , reached for my IPhone and the phone could no longer find the devices . I tried repeatedly , unplugged the devices , plugged them back in , deleted the app and reinstalled it all for nothing . For a brief period the reinstalled app found one of the devices but quickly lost it again . Had I been away and relying upon this thing to make my home look lived in , I 'd be furious , but I 'm not away so I simply returned it . Too bad . It sounded good but it is n't .	-1
I got this to control the AC for my pets while away . I 'm fairly tech-savvy , but was unable to get this set up , and resorted to an electronic timer switch . Problems ; takes for ever to set up the device . Once set-up it 's still hard to create rules for it . Also it seemed to interfere with my home wireless network . It seems like all automated locks are now on the z-wave standard , so you 'll need a z-wave controller anyway ; might as well go with the z-wave version of these if you are looking to build a home automation system .	-1
I used this switch to control a floodlight at another house I own . It worked great until I kept getting a nagging message on my iPhone that an update was needed . I finally updated and now the only way I can access the WeMo switch is when I am on the LAN . It is no longer accessible on WAN or 3G , which makes the device totally useless for me . Needless to say , it is going back to Amazon for a refund.Jan 10 , 2013 update : I finally got a reply from Belkin support ( Robert ) who sent the following link to fix the update screwup : [ ... ] which finally did fix the problems and I now once again have access to the switch . One should not have to go through this each time a new firmware or iPhone update is issued . I still can not recommend this product until they get it right , but will increase my rating to 2 stars .	-1
When this thing works , it 's nice to have . The problem is that it rarely works properly . Connection drops frequently and the app is terrible . The last update to the app reset all the settings and I had to re-set up the device ... .which was all in vain , as it never functioned properly again . Support is terrible , the functionality is terrible , the design is terrible ( so big it makes the other outlet useless ) . Setting up is easy ... .in theory , however in practice , this pos is terrible.Do yourself a favor and look at z-wave devices for home automation . Z-wave is much more diverse and expandable . I 'm using Z wave devices now in my home and never looked back . Or if you really want the wemo , I 'll give you mine ... .it makes a great paper weight .	-1
I had a lot of issues keeping this thing turned on so it would n't lose the wifi connection . after a long period of time would go by , a day or so , it would drop the connection and would not work . im not sure why they would make this product , knowing it does this . it a pain and a hassle to make sure its turned on and connected when you want to use it . not very convenient at all . would not recommend for anyone who does n't like pulling their hair out	-1
My iPhone 3GS hiccuped several times just opening the app . The the switch would lose connection frequently . I read the reviews from some of the more technical folks and tried moving the switch to another socket , but then decided if I want the thing to be in the socket where I need it , that 's where it needs to work . So , not for me . I 'll continue using myOutdoor Wireless Remote Control Power Outlet Switch .	-1
I tried this Home Automation switch with my iphone . I downloaaded the app and it froze my phone . I deleted it and retried it , froze again . I waited until my next phone update and tried for the third time . No luck . I have a 3GS phone so maybe an ipad or newer phone would work better but for now I 've not been able to use it and it sits in the drawer .	-1
Less than six feet , line of sight , to my router and it tells me signal strength is weak.Remote access would not configure . Said try later . Was able to turn on a test lamp once -- then never again . Firmware update would n't install . Returning to Amazon . Worthless . How on earth can Belkin sell something like this ? Beats me .	-1
This is a good idea for a product but it is tricky to set up properly and also seems a bit on the expensive side for that it is.If Belkin can get the kinks worked out with the software/firmware , I could see this having more potential as it does work as advertised once set up . Unfortunately as it is now , it 's frainkly just too tricky to get set up for the average consumer .	-1
I 've owned several Belkin products over the years . Happy with most . This one is NOT ready for primetime . Its an interesting concept , but I had problems right out of the box . The remote switch would not see my wireless . I had to unplug and replug several times . When it finally got up and running , it would work for a period of time and then cut out again . I was able to use my ipod to turn a lamp off and on at one point , but then that did n't even work . The most seamless part of the whole project was downloading the WeMo app . Its not enough to turn me off Belkin , but it certainly left me shaking my head .	-1
Conceptually , this is an outstanding product and Belkin has taken phenomenally complex home automation products and made some good strides to a more mainstream level . Sadly , Belkin did n't take this product to full bright.This is an expensive product that essentially turns on or off one outlet based on motion detection or remote control from an iDevice . The design of the product sucks up two full outlets , and in some cases can rob four . The device feels cheaply made . The installation is not as dirt dumb simple as the in box drawings led me to believe . All these things would n't be a big problem if the device did something useful and responded quickly . I 've set this up to turn on a light in my finished basement . Instead of turning the light on the instant the motion detector sees me move , it takes a good few seconds to turn on the light . It also requires a fair amount of movement to activate - if I 'm working on my computer in the room , every 15 minutes the light turns off.I can see , however , somebody that is in love with home automation , and maybe invested in X10 technology , would absolutely adore this device . I 'm pretty sure the price of admission for X10 is higher than this simple kit . I 'm trying so hard to find a good use for this device , and frankly I 'm coming up completely stumped in my house.Installation requires some pretty twisted steps to work . First step is to download and install the WeMo app from the iTunes app store . There is no iPad version of the app - so this beautiful app is relegated to the 2X pixilated view on an iPad , a really big miss in my opinion.Plug in the outlet side of the equation ( the part that has a three prong outlet on it . Way easier said than done , plug it in . The body of the device is about the size of a full single two outlet box . On an outlet strip it takes up the space for three plugs . As pictured here , a two plug outlet on a bare wall , this works pretty well . I had to get very creative on where I plugged in the outlet.Then pair the device with the wireless network . The first step is completely counterintuitive - go to the settings menu and choose the WeMo device in the wireless menu . Next go to the WeMo app and let the WeMo app find the device . This takes an amazingly long time - painfully slow . Once the device is found , it is possible to rename the device , and connect the device to the wireless network . At the bottom of the screen , available wireless networks are displayed ( if SSID is n't broadcast , a network name can be typed in ) . Select the correct network and enter the WiFi password . At some point there is an option to save the WiFi settings . Then the app works for what seems like an eternity to connect everything together . If everything was done exactly right , a brand new row in the Devices tab of the app appears where the outlet can be turned off or on.Belkin did a nice job making the app look clean and well finished . But looks are one thing . Here 's what is completely beyond me , my phone is already connected to my network - it already knows the password . Why in the world am I going to settings to find that WeMo device ? The first step should be run the WeMo app , find the device there ( just like it does for the wireless network ) , attach there , and then bind to the wireless network - of which I am already connected . There is no need for network passwords.Oh and then to rub salt in the wound , these devices are brand spanking new and Belkin is improving their functionality , a firmware update was required . Now this would n't be so bad if the update took place and the device worked right away . Nope , the device required an update and then had to sit for five minutes before it was useful again . Thankfully , I did n't have to go through the pairing nonsense again.Now that the device to be controlled is connected , it is time to attach the controller - or motion detector portion . Another design choice that I do n't care for , the wall outlet side looks exactly like the plug , except there is a solid piece of plastic over the outlets ( why that bump out was still necessary is beyond me ) . The device only requires a two plug outlet , no ground required for this . The motion detector piece is a six foot wire that uses a roughly 3mm jack to attach to the main device . In theory , the motion detector could be swapped for some other future detector device Belkin might sell . The practical use for unplugging is to allow routing of the wire.Adding the sensor device was as complex as adding the original outlet , except there is no need to enter the WiFi password ( the app remembers what was entered earlier ) . I was surprised that the sensor was found pretty quickly and was n't too hard to add to the system.Now here 's where things get either incredibly brilliant or incredibly stupid depending on perspective . In order to use the sensor , a `` rule '' has to be built . There are a bunch of different choices for the `` rule '' types . Through a series of options , the sensor can be made to turn on the outlet and keep it on as long as motion is detected . Timer rules can be set up that do n't use the sensor . And rules can be combined . And another completely crazy website with logic rules can be added to the whole mix - oh in this case these are recipes ( there is a whole community of early adopter people making WeMo 's do crazy things ) .What is completely illogical to me is the option settings for the motion detector . My first time out I could n't get the motion detector to stop detecting motion , even after I left the room . There is another completely different menu to set the options for the sensor - sensitivity being one of them.The bright spot , I have a lot of iDevices , and getting this to work on an iPad after setting everything up on an iPhone was a major piece of cake . Essentially , install the app and run it . The app found my switch and sensor.OK , so it took me a very long time to set this up . I had to rework where I placed the motion sensor , and rework a bunch of extension cords , in addition to all this app monkey business . Once all that work was done now I could enjoy automatic light turn on and remote control . Well yes and no . Yes it works , the light does turn on , and it stays on for 15 minutes ( the amount of time is adjustable ) after I leave the room . No it does n't work smoothly . It takes the sensor a long time to tell the lamp to turn on . The sensor does n't see me moving around in the room so it turns the light off ( if I were watching television , the same thing would happen ) . And that darn app just plain old stinks . If I want to turn on the lamp before I get to the room , I have to run the app , and then the stupid thing sits and spins looking at me for an eternity trying to find the WeMo 's . It can take up to 15 seconds before they are found . And sometimes the WeMo 's are n't detected . Once I get to the switch , I can press the cool power button , but then I 'm greeted with a pop up that tells me some mumbo jumbo about a rule in place and do I want to override the rule . So I tap that silly button ( hey app , of course I want to override the rule , I just touched the power button did n't I ) , and then I press the lamp power button again . The light is finally turned on.It 's all this wasted time and not ready for prime time apps that I 'm having all kinds of trouble with . I have a WiFi connected thermostat , a Nest that uses an app to allow me to control the temperature and look at a bunch of usage statistics and the current cooling or heating program . The instant I run that app ( it is super quick ) and touch the thermostat icon , I can adjust the temperature of my house . I wait maybe 2 seconds total to do that work . With the WeMo app , I sit and watch the stupid searching for devices , and then cross my fingers they are found , then I have to go through an `` are you sure '' question , and then I can turn the light on . I do n't understand how this device can be so stupid compared to the thermostat.Yes I can complain about the lack of instructions , thank you very much Apple for that horrible trend . In this case I think Belkin did a major disservice by not including a real live manual with this product . There are way too many complicated things this thing can do and nothing is intuitive . I had to enter the Belkin WeMo website to find out what the flashing lights meant . The documentation there was decent , and I was almost able to do everything on my own from those instructions.There is a really bad design feature of this device that I really hate ; the reset button is on the top back side of the device . In order to factory reset the device , unplug the device , hold down that button , then plug the device back in , and release the button after 10 seconds . I had to do this 5 times before I was finally successful . The button could be easily put on the side , or use the same design for routers - a small paper clip hole.There is a bright spot with this device , tech support is amazing . I did something really stupid with this device , I tried to install it in a hotel ( yeah , it 's complicated ) . Back at home after trying everything imaginable to get it to work , I called tech support . They were able to walk me down off the ledge and get the device working . The fuller story , the device wo n't work with a network that requires a browser based log in . Hey , how could I know that ? I then tried to install the device in my home . Unfortunately , it kept trying to connect to the old hotel network , even though I selected my home network on the device screen . There is a secret menu under More that remembers the network it was last connected to . Even though I told the app to forget about that old network , it refused to delete it . I had to remove the app and reinstall it . After that nonsense , the pairing went much better . But I was at my eighth time entering my WPA password.There is a good chance Belkin will expand the ecosystem of the WeMo . It seems to have potential for the home automation lover . If Belkin could improve the app , the process for pairing , the design of the case , responsiveness of the sensor , and lower the price - they would have a grand slam . As it stands right now , this is a serious early adopter product , not really ready for prime time .	-1
OK , this Belkin WeMo sounds like a great invention . Turn on a lamp of other device from your iPad , or iPhone , etc . Here are the problems:1 . The design of the plug in device is such that it takes up an entire two outlet surface . It could have been designed with a swivel male part so that it would not take up an entire wall receptacle.2 . The software is easily installed , but two separate options appeared for web enablement . I chose one of them , perhaps the wrong one ? 3 . I tried setting the unit up using two different lamps in my house . Neither one of them worked.4 . A firmware update took place automatically and I tried setting it up with a lamp in my bedroom again . No luck either.I spent 45 minutes fiddling with this Belkin gizmo that is supposed to be soooo easy to install and use -- so intuitive . What I now have is a sense of frustration coupled with a headache . I deleted the app from my iPad and am having a nice glass of lemonade and thinking that this gizmo is a lemon.Belkin does provide an Early Release Technical Support Team number ( 1-866-528-7596 ) . I did not call -- yet . Waiting for a day with zero to do .	-1
I was real excited to get this product and knew that it would take awhile to figure it out but not this long ! I got so frustrated I almost threw it out the window after working on it for a few hours ! The premise of this product sounds great but to much work for the money . Wait till they figure out all the glitches.Skip !	-1
Home automation systems cost a small fortune and often require the expertise of a professional installer . The Belkin Wemo Home Automation Switch + Motion Sensor bundle for Apple iPhone , iPad and iPod touch seeks to change that model . ( Note to the Belkin Product Marketing Group : Could n't you come up with a simpler and flashier name ? ) Sadly , it does n't succeed at doing so . Complexity tends to get in the way tripping up the device and the user.The product has its up and downs . Its biggest up is the ability to control the devices remotely through an iPhone or iPad . It promises the ability to set and control your home automation needs from virtually anywhere over Wi-Fi or 3G . That 's the theory , at least.Its biggest down is the lack of instructions and complexity of set up . Belkin seems to feel that a ( barely ) one page cardboard cutout `` Quick Install Guide '' with a few icons is enough . It 's not ! There are two many things that need explained . For example , WeMo creates not one but two Wi-Fi ad hoc networks -- WeMo.C29 and WeMo.057 . What did these cryptic network names mean ? I assume that one network is from the switch with the other is from the sensor . Which do you select in you i-device 's Settings app ? Once I had the sensor device talking to my iPad ( BTW , Belkin-where 's your native iPad app for this device ? ) it wanted to update itself to the latest firmware . Well that 's all well and good , but the message was confusing . `` The sensor will flash blue when the upgrade has completed . '' But the sensor continued to flash blue through the upgrade process.But happily the upgrade completed and I went to set up a rule . I wanted the Wemo to turn on a light in my Man Cave when I entered the room when it was evening . So I cliicked on rules . At that point the Wemo app informed me that I had to set up a switch first . How ? Maybe that was the other network that I found . Did that mean that I had to do the Settings app dance and change networks again ? The only help that the Wemo offered was a message that read ( and never changed ) `` Looking for switches ... '' Then I was told that I needed to close and reopen the WeMo App . So I did . That did n't work because I kept getting the same message saying that I needed to close and reopen the WeMo app . Eventually somehow I got the attention of the switch . It asked to be associated with my home network just as the sensor had . However , for reasons that are n't clear either the WeMo App or the switch was n't able to connect to my home network . Why ? The sensor was able to do so.Listen , Belkin , the success of the iPhone and the iPad for that matter is that they are intuitively simple . I have a Master 's degree in computer engineering and yet you have me stumped . Maybe I 'll eventually figure it out , but as I see it , is time for you to go back to the drawing boards . Find and hire some software engineers who understand user interfaces and simplicity in set ups . You have a great idea in creating a relative inexpensive home automation solution , but until you make it intuitive and easy to install this is n't a product that I can recommend .	-1
Previously titled `` works as well as the wemo switches ... . STILL ca n't recommend '' -- -- -15 February 2013 Update -- -- -I 'm moving from 1 star which my rating since purchase in early January 2013 and bumping it to 2 stars . I was ready to give 3 stars , however , I 've had two switches drop off-line in the past day . ( this is only that I know of , I ca n't say they do n't drop off-line willy nilly while I 'm at work ) .. By dropping off-line I mean the dreaded kill the light that is connected and start flashing orange for hours on end . The remote access and general LAN access has been better since the latest 2062 update.I still await a native ipad app , android compatibility and even a mac osx and/or windows version****These were not advertised as features and as such I 'm not withholding a rating based on this requested feature. -- -- -12 February 2013 Update -- -- -Update to WeMo_US_2.00.2062.PVT yesterday I had to do a full factory reset on all my devices to get them to display in my IOS 1.1.9 app . After a full reset I was actually able to firmware update the ones that have n't showed up in weeks . I currently have 2 motion sensors and 4 switches . 3 of the switches have n't been available for remote access for weeks . I also think now that I have done a factory reset I will have to set up IFTT again but I 'm not sure , I have n't received an email for weeks about no connectivity so I 'm sure it 's broken since the connection dropped very frequently . Currently all devices show up remotely.It is still too early to determine if the latest update has actually made this a more than 1 star product . Time will tell . I can tell you that one switch has already dropped off line with the new firmware ... . I was in the living room and the light just turned off . I looked at the wemo switch and it was blinking blue ... and then amber so another `` connectivity '' issue . This switch is 20 feet from my AP.Also while setting up one of my switches after the factory reset one single switch did n't `` remember '' my wireless settings in the IOS app . I added it to the same SSID however while it was available via local LAN it did n't show up in remote access . I factory reset this specific switch for the 3rd time and after that it pulled credentials from my saved wifi settings . This seems consistent with belkin claiming my devices were set up with an AP extender ( apparently if you have an extender it is n't supported ) I actually do n't have an extender ( only one AP ) but belkin support looked on the `` cloud '' and said I had extenders and that is why all switches did n't show up remotely.Still not ready for primetime with latest firmware but really close I think. -- -- -17 January 2013 Update -- -- -My 3 switches each still loose connectivity about once every 3 days . The outage ( ie blinking amber light ) can last anywhere from a few minutes to up to 5 hours . Only Living Room Lamp 1 has shown up for remote control ( via internet ) for the past week . I 'm not sure why other devices do n't show up but LR Lamp 1 always seems to but no other devices . I get an email from IFTTT about every 3 days letting me know that they have lost connectivity to my motion sensor . Still running v.2008 firmware and the IOS app has n't been updated recently and still @ 1.1.9I realize that not all internet access is consistent but I have comcast business premium and my up-time is phenomenal . Also when I `` lose '' connection ( based on IFTTT or remote internet access in IOS app ) I 'm always able to open a VPN tunnel to my house so I know it 's not my internet access. -- -- -12 January 2013 Update -- -- -Well I lost lamp 2 again on 10 January . It flashed amber for around 5 hours , I unplugged the device and plugged it back in and still flashed amber the rest of the night . It was back online the next day without any further intervention . Lamp 1 turned off earlier today . I had this lamp on and it just turned off and then the wemo switch started blinking amber . I unplugged and reapplied power to the wemo device but it still flashed amber . Finally after around 3 hours of flashing amber and not showing up in the IOS app it decided to reconnect . I am now able to control this wemo switch via IOS app . Received an email from IFTTT just a few minutes ago and the motion sensor has gone off line ... it is blinking amber . The uptime of these devices seems to be a few days . I 'm not expecting 5 9s by any mean for a consumer product but I do expect it to work most of the time and for long periods of time . My x10 stuff never had connectivity issues . With current firmware of 2008 I still ca n't recommend anyone buy this beta crap. -- -- -9 January 2013 Update -- -- -Just received an email from my IFTTT account saying it had lost contact with my Motion Detector . After firing up the ipad remotely I 'm missing 2 switches and one motion detector . I closed out the IOS app and restarted but the devices still do n't show up . Perhaps the next firmware update will fixed connectivity problems since 2008 didn't. -- -- -8 January 2013 Update -- -- -Version 2.0.2008.pvt firmware was released yesterday . No new functions for the motion detector or switch . IFTTT still only supports one wemo switch and one wemo motion detector . Description of release I believe was `` squashed some bugs '' but I 'm going from memory so that may not be exact . Have n't had any issues so far . I was having connectivity issues with all my switches and noticed my motion detector dropped off-line at least once before latest firmware . Hopefully upcoming firmwares will improve product features as well as reliability . I also changed my 2.4GHz radio from short preamble to long preamble to see if that increases uptime of the switches . If I have good uptime with latest firmware I may change back to short preamble to further diagnose. -- -- -4 January 2013 Original Post -- -- -Well I purchased this after buying two wemo switches ( obviously not ready for consumer use ) . I had many problems with the switches and spent hours trying to configure them . The switch which came in this pack was no exception it was also not suited for consumer use . Surprisingly the motion detection unit was easy to setup and after a firmware update only required one manual intervention ( ie manually unplugging it and re-inserting it after the firmware update ) Cons : Cost - Belkin should be paying us to refine their buggy firmwareWhen setting up rules the motion sensor is listed as `` Very high sensitivity '' but I can find no way to change sensitivity . If you could control it that would be great.I would also like to set a timeout . If you sense motion do n't trip on motion for the next XX minutes . I set up an IFTTT `` recipe '' and get a text every few seconds as it trips . If you could customize this in the software that would be great.the IOS software is horrible - iphone native which is horrible looking on the ipad 2 , a little better on retina displays but still bad and on top of that no landscape mode which seems so outdated.Pros : It has a cool blue light that illuminates the sensor when it detects the high sensitivity motion .	-1
Setting this up was similar to my wireless thermostat - you connect your iphone to the unit 's wireless which lets you then change the unit to get on YOUR wireless . That part worked flawlessly for both devices , the motion sensing receiver and the main switch.Both set themselves up for internet access without any issue.I plugged an ipod dock into the switch , one of the big Philips units that I have . Got the app running on my phone and it switches on and off manually just fine . Worked flawlessly . For people who have things they need to control via remote phone control , the switch is a great solution . Simple on/off functionality will work nicely . Unfortunately I 'm in a newly constructed house so I do n't even have floor lamps or anything - all my lighting is in the ceiling , either mounted on the surface in the bedrooms and office or recessed lighting in the halls , kitchen , great room , and elsewhere . I have no need for something to turn my toaster oven on and off , since it 'd constantly lose the time . And that 's about all I have that is plugged into a wall other than computer equipment . So for me the use is very limited until they start coming out with in wall light switches that can be controlled by this software.Now for the motion sensor - it clearly sees motion . I get the blue light whenever I walk by it . The app shows motion detected . But the rule I have set to turn on the only switch in the system immediately when motion is sensed , and leave it turned on for 15 minutes , was NEVER able to actually activate the switch . I could override the rule manually anytime by simply pushing the button in the app to manually turn on the switch , but in all the fiddling with it , never did the motion sensor actually manage to turn it on . They say to disable and enable a rule if you had to override something manually , but that made no difference . They said to unplug everything for 20 seconds or so , made no difference , other than I had to plug the switch itself back in three times before it was finally working again at all or even seen by the app.So if you 're getting the non bundle with just the switches , it 'll probably work great for you . I like the app , it 's very simple to use , and rules are insanely easy to make . Big buttons `` Turn on '' or `` Turn off '' and the standard IOS time wheel to pick when something happens.Avoid the sensor bundle until there 's more proof out there that it actually works as advertised .	-1
The process of setting up the WeMo app/hardware is fraught with so many problems , I do n't even know where to start . But I will attempt to describe at least a few of them : ( 1 ) Bad Connection : I tried in vain for a almost an hour to get the WeMo app to connect to the 2 WeMo devices , but each time I got the message `` Sorry , we are still trying to connect to your WeMo device . Please close and re-open the WeMo App . `` ( 2 ) Usability Issue : Every time I launched the WeMo App , I got a prompt saying `` New Firmware available . Update now ? & lt ; Yes > & lt ; Not Now > '' ( It will keep bugging you until you answer `` Yes . '' ) Since I had trouble getting the WeMo app to recognize the switches , I figured maybe a firmware upgrade might help . So , I selected yes and was presented with a menu of choices , among which was -- lo and behold -- `` New Firmware Available , '' which I naturally selected since THAT WAS MY INTENT WHEN I SELECTED `` Yes '' to the firmware upgrade ! ( Warning : those with severe ADHD , beware of being sidetracked with the menu of choices . I happen to know an ADHD friend who probably would n't be able to keep her focus on the task at hand due to the onslaught of menu choices . ) Upon selecting `` New Firmware Available , '' I was once again presented with a single option to `` Upgrade , '' which I again had to select . Next , a message popped up saying the upgrade would take two minutes ... to which I had to acknowledge by tapping on OK . The app then brought me back to the main menu , and a few minutes later ... nothing . I tried the procedure a few times over and still , nothing . ( 3 ) Rule Would n't Save : Through what must have been a sheer stroke of luck , I was finally able to get the app to connect to both devices ( I had either no connection , or I was able to connect to 1 device at a time ) . I proceeded to set up a rule to turn on my light whenever the motion sensor sensed motion , but the rule simply would n't save . I knew the sensor was working because each time I moved in front of it , the message `` Ohhh , I sense motion '' appeared . I finally figured out why : I had to change the default `` Rule 1 '' name to SOMETHING ELSE before the rule would save . And so I did . ( 4 ) App Freeze : The app froze several times while I was trying to connect to the WeMo units . Thanks to Apple 's sandboxing ( which is a double-edged sword , if you ask me [ I want the option of shooting myself in the foot if I choose to ! ! ] ) , the entire IOS did n't come crashing down due to a single misbehaving app.After almost an hour , the WeMo finally worked ( perfectly , at that ) .The basic steps I had to go through to get WeMo to recognize the units : ( 1 ) Plug in the WeMo units . ( 2 ) Go to iPhone Settings and select the WeMo Wifi network . ( 3 ) Start the WeMo app . ( 4 ) If one or more of the WeMo units are not recognized , unplug them . ( 5 ) Quit the WeMo App ( Double-click the iPhone Home button , press and hold any one of the icons for the apps currently running , wait two seconds for the encircled `` - '' symbol to appear on the top left corner of each of the icons , and tap on the `` - '' that appears over the WeMo app to close it ) . ( 6 ) Rinse and repeat ( until the WeMo app decides to recognize both WeMo units ) .The Rules -- -- -- -- -I configured two rules for the WeMo : ( 1 ) Turn off the lights at 6:21 AM , and ( 2 ) Turn on the lights if motion is detected BETWEEN 8:00 PM to 6:20 AM. -- -The WeMo takes a lot of coaxing to get it working , but once I got it working , it worked flawlessly . My perseverance had paid off , but I 'm not quite sure I want to go through it again ! If you 're somewhat technically inclined and you have LOTS of patience , the WeMo might work for you . Otherwise , I 'd pass . [ Update 2012-09-15 ] I had to reset my router , but that broke WeMo . I tried to set WeMo up again and again and again and again and again , but I kept getting stuck at the `` Setup Successful '' screen . Now , whenever I start WeMo , the app remains frozen on the `` Setup Successful '' screen . I 've lost the fight in me to keep trying , so WeMo remains broken . Even all the king 's horses and all the king 's men could n't put WeMo together again . Rating downgraded from 2 to 1 .	-1
Bought the lot of 10 bulbs with one bad from the start . Another quit after 2 months and just replaced 5 more after 9 months . And they have been out for at least a month . Do n't bother buying these !	-1
Another case of getting what you pay for . When I first installed these bulbs in my landscape lights I was pleased with both the lumens and the temperature of the light . I was replacing 50W halogen bulbs with these 20W LED bulbs . The 50W were too bright but these 20W were just right . ( actually , these are 4W bulbs , not 20W -- not sure why listing title says 20W -- maybe that 's the supposed brightness equivalent ) To be honest , the bulbs that came with the landscape lighting did n't last as long as I had hoped . The lighting system was installed in the summer of last year ( 2012 ) and , within 2-3 months , began to burn out -- I was replacing bulbs even before winter arrived . I bought these LEDs expecting to get longer service and fewer replacements . I 'm planning on selling my house within the year so I want something I do n't need to continually futz around with.Unfortunately , these lights are not it . Within a month of replacing the old bulbs with these new bulbs they began to fail . I guess I 'm just going to have to bite the bullet and buy better bulbs . I hope my buyers appreciate that . & # 128533 ; P.S . It took forever for these bulbs to be delivered . Mine were shipped from Hong Kong ( that should have been a tip-off right there ) .	-1
Let me start off with a caveat . I am tough to please with `` special '' tools . For the most part , I do n't like them because very few ever seem to be useful enough to justify the cost and space they take up . It takes a lot for a tool to earn a spot in my toolbox.This driver was a nice idea , but sort of fell down in the execution . I tried using it for a couple little projects , and it mostly came up short . The ratchet had a nice feel , and it was easy to set it to tighten , loosen or lock with just one hand- although it was a little too easy to switch the setting by accident . There is also a lever on the T-handle which opens the jaws so they can adjust themselves to a nut.1 . My first project was changing the furnace filter , which requires removing an access panel , conveniently held in place with about 392 little hex-head screws . I figured this would be an ideal task for this tool . Unfortunately it just could n't get a grip on the small heads of the screws . Score one for the socket driver.2 . The next task was replacing a few 1/2 inch bolts on a trailer . The Turbo Driver was nice to use , and the T-handle made it easy to apply sufficient torque to the bolts to break them loose . Unfortunately the jaws just did n't grip tight enough , and it wanted to chew up and round off the nuts . Score another one for the socket set.3 . The next job was to replace a few nuts on a table-top for a table saw . Unfortunately it was just too big to get into a small space.4 . Finally , I thought I had it . I am refinishing a number of cabinet faces , and needed to remove and reinstall a number of wood screws . I hate to use an electric driver on nice wood , because it is just too easy to get carried away and do damage . I tried a 2 '' long screwdriver bit , but the jaws really could n't hold that straight . Next I tried a small bit ( sort of like a drywall tip ) , and this worked pretty well . I loved having the `` feel '' of a manual screwdriver , yet still having the convenience and mechanical advantage of the ratchet . Unfortunately , every time I finished driving a screw , the tip stayed in the screw and popped out of the driver jaws . It got old very quickly.So , in summary , I just did n't find the Turbo Driver useful enough to keep it in my toolbox . It did a number of tasks almost well enough to be useful , but seemed to just come up short . I have considered epoxying a screwdriver tip into the jaws just to have a nice ratcheting screwdriver-but that seems a waste .	-1
This sounds like a good tool to use in circumstances where a socket handle would have a tough time fitting the space , and in a pinch and perfect circumstances that might be right , but there are too many design flaws for it to do the job the designers think it will do.The idea is that this tool will `` open and close '' over hex head bolts , replacing all your sockets , and will point straight down into narrow space where you ca n't use a socket set with a handle . Here is what REALLY happens:1 . The oddly shaped opening will not grasp screws or bolts with smaller heads at all . Scratch at LEAST half of the 14 sizes it claims to handle.2 . It will only fit up to 1/2 '' bolts . Scratch any larger jobs you thought it might be nice to use it 's unusual torque action for.3 . Even for Goldilocks set of sizes it will actually fit , it does n't really clamp them tightly enough , since it just closes down and does n't really lock securely to the size . Part of the problem here is the manner in which the business end opens and closes . Since it breaks open from the middle , it leaves two of the six sides of a hex head without any contact with the socket . That leads to a loose fit.4 . For really small spaces , this is neither narrow enough nor long enough to be of universal utility . For many jobs , you 're still going to need narrower and/or longer drive extensions.5 . Frankly , where socket handles fit , I 'd MUCH RATHER use a normal socket wrench with a handle . Why ? Because the ergonomics of this handle cause the torque to come from my elbow . With a normal socket handle , the torque comes from my shoulder . I found my elbow experiencing some pain after just a brief use of this tool . For my own use , this is the most compelling reason to not use the tool.6 . While the business end seems sturdy enough , the handle is a relatively cheap feeling plastic . I drop tools sometimes . I 've never had a metal socket driver or handle break when I drop it . Plastic ? Yes.I could probably go on , but these reasons are sufficient in themselves to avoid this product.It 's a shame ; when I first saw this I thought it looked intriguing . However , it took very little real experience to cure me of that optimism . If the `` engineer '' who designed and built this thing worked for me , I 'd probably wind up firing him , unless I 'd specifically told him to develop a cool looking gimmick that does n't work worth a damn to rip off consumers.Not recommended whatsoever . In my opinion this is a waste of money .	-1
This turbo driver advertises that it does a lot of jobs in one and this is suppose to be a multi-tool . However , it is really not as useful as advertised . My husband is a handyman who has done construction and have built houses in the past and constantly looking for new tools . With this , you may be able to get away with simple jobs but that 's it.It is not big enough to accommodate more sizes of sockets and if you are constantly working on jobs requiring a driver then you need something with a bit more usefulness . It is also pretty bulky for what is suppose to be a simple tool . It is not something that we would put in our toolbox as it takes up so much space with minimal usefulness . It 's not easily maneuverable and we will not be using this tool again .	-1
I do not know why it doe not work but it just not work.I think I might be one of the unlucky one .	-1
I 'm gon na yak here for a second ... HERE 'S THE SKINNY ; I string a LOT of guitars , and have since 1977 . I use a high-speed 600RPM dedicated cordless screwdriver ( the Ryobi Tec 4V ) . I really wanted to like this PW Drill Bit Peg Winder adaptor , but I find it too cumbersome to work with at high speed . Although most people would find its multi-instrument design to be an asset , I find it makes this adaptor too big and clumsy for my guitar work . This is why I ONLY USE IT ON BASSES.On guitar tuners , it utterly engulfs the tuner knobs in its behemoth maw and disconnects me from one of the important things I monitor while stringing at industrial speeds . ( I monitor the string wrap , string tension , turning post and knob while aligning the string in the nut and on the saddle ) . If I ca n't see the knob , I feel like I 'm disconnected from what 's happening.Another thing is that this winder adaptor is made from a resin that is IMHO is too hard to have spinning at the speed I 'd be using it at right next to expensive guitar wood and metal with delicate finishes . However , because bass tuners are much larger , this adaptor usually does n't come too close to the headstock of a bass.IMHO , Planet Waves usually makes pretty decent and innovative products , although I 've heard from a lot of techs that they dislike PW stuff . I 'm not sure why . I know Daddario 's CS is obnoxious to communicate with and does n't listen to their customers ( anymore ) , but they do arguably make one of the best strings and other neat products for the musician.Although I do n't personally like the Planet waves Drill Bit Peg Winder , it does have a metal shank and it should last two lifetimes . Maybe it 'll work for you ? Hope this review helps someone .	-1
Bottom line : While the Deckjet has a few positive features , clean-up is a chore and it does not work well with certain types of stains . Replacement pads may be problematic . All in all , I do n't see it as a compelling purchase.Main review : I 'm all for anything that will save me time and effort when staining a deck since it 's my least favorite paining job . I was hoping the Deckjet would speed things along , but found out it really did n't help all that much.If you 're familiar with any of the Wagner paint stick products ( either manual or battery powered ) you 'll feel at home with this . The principle is the same for all their paint stick products -- you draw in a quantity of paint/stain , and it gets transferred to the applicator ( in this case a pad ) to save you the trouble of using a paint pan or dipping into the paint can.The build quality is decent for the price . The pad has a removable attachment with two brushes to help get the stain between the boards . The pad attaches with sturdy velcro.I was fortunate to have a friend who was tearing out their deck , so I was able to experiment with a variety of stains without having to worry about doing a good job . Perfect test bed ! As a comparison , I also had my usual pad and pole setup plus a regular brush setup ( 2 and 6 inch widths ) , and tried a few stains to see which method worked best.First up was one of my favorite stains , which is made by Flood . It 's a thin product and comes in both color and clear formulations ( I used cedar tone for the test ) . I was able to draw it up into the Deckjet without any problems . It was difficult , however , to regulate the flow to the pad -- I was always getting the pad too saturated regardless of how careful I was with the Deckjet trigger . Fortunately the Flood stain tolerates a heavy application . Other stains , however , would not have looked good . In comparison , applying it with a regular pad/pole allowed for a much more even application . The best looking application was via brush.Next I tried a semi-transparent stain by Behr . This was more challenging to draw into the Deckjet but by working slowly I was able to fill it . The flow rate was much easier to control , and after a few practice boards I was applying even layers quicker than I could with a conventional pad or brush . Looked as good as a conventional pole/pad , and nearly as good as a brush application.Next was some old solid stain by Olympic . It 's thick to begin with , but age has made it even thicker . This was almost impossible to pull into the Deckjet - really had to struggle to get just a bit loaded , so I did n't even try to apply it to the deck . I had no problems applying it by hand , however.Lastly , I tried some regular latex paint just to see how it would work . Although this is not made for regular paint , it was not too bad -- a bit tough to load , but it applied well provided that you moved slowly.Did the Deckjet save me time ? Yes , when I was working with stain that was not too thick and not too thin . In the other cases , a regular pole/pad or brush was just as fast even with having to dip into the can or pan regularly.But the small amount of time saved when applying stain gets eaten up with the time needed to clean the Deckjet well . It was a real pain to get spotlessly clean . And getting it spotless is what 's needed to keep it working well -- I learned that the hard way with another Wagner paint stick for indoor use . This has to be spotless or the chances of it working again are severely diminished . Also , be sure to keep the O-rings well lubricated with petroleum jelly ( a small pack is included with the Deckjet ) . Once the O-rings dry out or crack , you 'll get leaks and/or not be able to create enough suction to draw in the stain.The other issue that causes a dip in the score is the durability of the pad . Like any other pad , it takes a beating on rough boards and will need to be replaced . A regular pad that attaches to a pole is pretty cheap and easy to find , but I expect the replacement pads for this will be a bit ( or a lot ) more expensive . I do n't know that for sure since the pads do n't seem to be easily available . That 's a big concern.Was the application quality good ? Yes , when I was working with the semi-transparent stain on smooth to mostly smooth boards . On rough boards , not so much . Plus , even on smooth boards , it was tough to work the stain into the cracks and crevices nearly as well as I could with a brush.If you want to avoid bending , a regular pole with a stain pad or roller will keep you upright , and will be a lot easier to clean . If you want to do the best possible job , you ca n't beat a conventional , good quality brush . Take it one board at a time , work in the shade , use short strokes to work the stain into all the nooks , crannies and gaps , and finish off with a long stroke.If having a gadget helps make painting fun , by all means get this . However , if you 're looking to save time , this is not a good choice unless you intend to use it once and then toss it . What you save in application time will be spent in cleaning ( or looking for replacement pads ) .	-1
I have used this on my deck twice so far and it works well , and assembly is easy . The con is that as other reviewers have noted the replacement pads are not available from Wagner . You need to have replacement pads since they wear off pretty quickly when you are trying to paint the deck .	-1
The Wagner 0271066 DeckJet Stain Applicator is designed to make it easy and efficient in applying a stain or paint to your deck . The stain is drawn right from the gallon can into the reservoir tube , and by squeezing a handle , the stain is injected into a `` paint pad , '' ready for application to the deck.This applicator was set up in less than a minute straight out of the box . Nice ! And the reservoir tube does n't leak . Double nice ... no drips or spills at all.HOWEVER ... This deck applicator had a pad with a stiff brush on one side for getting the stain between the boards . If your deck has boards perfectly spaced with about a 3/8 inch spacing , great . However , if the spacing is less ( aged decks warp in strange ways ) , then the spacing is decreased , and the brush can not fit in the space , resulting in one side of the stain applicator being raised higher than the other . I got used to this , but it was a real pain when I wanted to do some more detailed work around edges and posts coming out of the deck . You 'll need to finish those with a brush.My biggest concern , however , is that when using an oil-based stain , you really have to go through a LOT of mineral spirits to clean this contraption . Then you 've got a gallon or more of mineral spirits to dispose of . I recommend this device more for water-based stains and paints , so it is easier to clean.So ... make sure you still have a brush available and enough cleaning solvent . For smaller decks , a wide brush probably is just as efficient as this applicator.ADDED OBSERVATION : I just finished painting the deck with a six dollar , six inch stain applicator pad and a three dollar pole . I just poured the stain into an old paint roller pan , wicked some onto the pad , and applied . There was no wastage , I covered the deck with the same number of total strokes , and clean up was a breeze compared to this product .	-1
The deck attached to my condo is 21 years old and in fairly good shape for its age , but there are a few places where the boards are a little rougher than the rest . The deck is pressurized lumber 10 ' x 16 ' with two 6 ' x 8 ' fence panels for privacy.I applied Flood CWF-UV Clear Wood Finish in the Cedar shade ; this coating is thicker than water but not as thick as a syrup . It drew up into the tube easily . There was a definite learning curve as to how much trigger to use to get the pad loaded with stain . My deck soaked up the stain ; I had to refill the tube every 3 or 4 planks , which was kind of a hassle.Halfway through the pad started pulling away , this also made it impossible to completely fill the syringe as there was a loss of vacuum . Eventually the pad came all the way off . I 'm not talking coming unhooked , I 'm saying the foam pad pulled away from the plastic where it was glued on . I made a trip to both Lowe 's and Home Depot ; no one has this pad in stock yet . I ended up finishing my deck and fence panels the old-fashioned , easier way . ( Using a 6 '' roller with a long handle and a paintbrush for the areas hard to reach with a roller ) .Ease of use : Not easy ; more novel than anything else.Clean-up : Tossed the pad that fell apart and will buy a new one the next time if I can find one , hard to clean oil-based sealer/stain out of a syringe . However , not sure if I want to ever use this again due to my bad experience.Neither Lowes nor Home Depot have replacement pads for this . I hope they are available other than ordering direct from Wagner , which seems to be the only place for now .	-1
Summary : 4 stars until the pad tears . Having used their stick roller to do walls , this product has a similar issue - cleanup is a little bit of a pain.Prior to this I used a Wagner airless sprayer to apply stain - I 'd then go over it with a 4 '' brush to even it out and get it to the sides of the boards . This has a side pad which does that for you . I 'm just under 6 foot and I found this to be too short to use comfortably - I was hunched over and had a pretty sore back after the job.The main problem is that the very nice fabric pad is attached to the head with foam . After you hit enough splinters , the pad tears and then you 're sunk . My opinion is that they should have added a spare pad to the kit and raised the price a couple of bucks . These pads ca n't be more than that to produce in bulk.Here it is , 6 months later and you still ca n't find replacement pads . Note that the Deck Mate is a different product and the pads WILL NOT work on this.Cleanup was perhaps 10-15 minutes .	-1

When I ordered additional boxes of HD Screws , I noticed that they all came from Taiwan . I also noticed that some are not precisely made to specification and stripped my screw drivers head . Kreg often passes itself off as a company that manufactures in America , but when I called them about the trouble I was having , they readily admit that they get items like screws and bits from overseas .	-1
This is just an OK jig - with only 2 positions for hole lineup . To be fair - this is a fairly inexpensive jig - and the hole position choices provided are the generally standard ones . The 5mm version is the same as the 1/4 version - with the exception that it comes with a 1/4 to 5mm step drill bit . Connecting 2 together - with the flimsy plastic connector plate - does not make for a very sturdy longer jig . The on-board ( back of jig ) storage for 2 drill bits and locating pin is clever - but suggests that Kreg should offer the jig bundled with both 1/4 and 5mm bits together - not require that you purchase them separately - or buy a separate bit for $ 7.99	-1
Now I do n't work in the field anymore but all told I have about 10 years of experience in electrical and electronics ranging from industrial to computer engineering and etc . While I 'm hardly an expert I know the basics of soldering.Now say I 'm a normal family man . An everyday Joe Six-Pack . Say I come home one day and find out that a guy killed my wife . Say if he was brutal too..I mean just went to town on her . Say for some reason he beats the rap and comes over to my house and says `` Listen , man I 'm not sorry about your wife or anything but can I borrow some solder ? '' . I would not hesitate to reach for this solder knowing full well what his life will be like during the time he completes whatever task he has set himself to do.No flow and extremely high melting point . I was starting to melt components not to mention burning my hands on the handle of the soldering iron handle itself . Seeing as it was cheaply made in China I 'm sure the fumes are going to give me Super-AIDS as well. & lt ; Dear Authorities Who Do Not Understand Jokes , the following is meant as a joke . Thank you > If I met the marketing person behind the decision to increase margins by making this inferior product I would melt his brain & lt ; Sarcasm >	-1
I 'm sure this thermostat works well enough , but mine was DOA - screen freezes immediately after power is connected . Trane informed me that the unit was bad , and that they would send me a replacement unit and a box to ship the old one back in . A week later , neither item ever arrived , and I got a phone call from Trane `` following up '' on my service request . I said I never got the new unit , and they said , `` We do n't handle product returns , you need to return it to the merchant to get a new one . '' I told them that there was no merchant , that I received the product from them to write a review for it . They insisted that they ca n't send me a new one . I finally gave up and put my old thermostat back in .	-1
Brought this thermostat for a 2gig alarm system , arrived DOA . Also be aware that this unit requires power to be supplied from your AC system 24v AC and does not have a battery option . Ended up buying the 2gig CT100	-1
I received this thermostat and it was 100 % my fault I did n't realize I did n't have the common wire so I could n't use this . Well today I finally had a professional come out to install the wire for me and hook the thermostat up . Sadly I spent over $ 100 to get this done and it turns out the thermostat is dead . I 've put a request in to Schlage and Trane to see about getting it replaced , but my unit was dead right from the start . So far no response .	-1
I really wanted this thing to work . I even crawled into the crawlspace to make sure I had the blue ( C ) wire connected to the furnace . Then we had to find the blue wire in the mass of wires stuck in the wall . Finally , got everything connected and put the faceplate on . It would not power on.I called customer service during the stated CS hours , and the phone rang and rang . I could not speak to a rep during the hours the company states a rep is available.Again , I had high hopes for this . I currently have a pretty nice Hunter thermostat , but I wanted one that I could monitor online . Also , I was quite happy the kit came with some extras ( door lock , dimmer , bridge , etc. ) . Despite my high hopes we had to uninstall the Trane and reinstall the Hunter .	-1
Great thermostat , but has many misstatements as to what it can do , and you have to pay a monthly fee to manage it remotely from your iPhone . My backlight work off and on and will be returning it to Amazon .	-1
Not happy with unit as it does n't handle humidity and it keeps disconnecting from the bridge in the same room . Buttons and programming by hand not fun at all . As a professional installer of many types of electronics for over 20 years , this will work for some people and it may work great if you do n't care that the humidity is out of control and costing more money than necessary to run your HVAC . Humidity is very important to keep under control . The unit does n't seem to read or set temperatures as indicated on the display . I set 3 thermometers next to the unit and all 3 showed the same but different temperature than this unit , so even the internal temperature sensor is not as accurate as I would think it should be . Many other units out there and if you are looking to only save a few dollars by getting this over lets say the Honeywell touchscreen , get the HONEYWELL ! This is sadly a downgrade from my existing thermostat that came with my Trane 16XLi . RMA in process .	-1
I got this simply because it looked cool - and it is . It works exactly as described : when the water is cold , the lights are blue ; hot , the lights are red ; `` comfortable , '' and the lights are green . It 's self-powered , so you turn on the water , and the lights come on.I have two issues with it . First , the water pressure is not very strong . I replaced a cheap , single shower head that had begun simply wearing out after 10 years on the job . Even so , however , it still had more pressure than this new one has . This one has a nice , tight spray of water , though , and that makes it really nice for quickly rinsing off.Second , though , is those LEDs . While they are cool and work as promised , the range of `` comfortable '' water is pretty wide . In playing with the temp , I can get the water down to a pretty uncomfortable cold before it finally turns blue , and - of far more concern - up to a `` don't-touch-that ! '' hot long before it turns red.Basically , this is a fun gadget that will be a good guideline for water temperature . However , nothing beats just sticking your hand under the faucet and making sure the water 's comfortable . ***March 20 updateI have changed my review from a 4-star to a 1-star . While everything I wrote before is still valid , the showerhead is already leaking - after only a month on the job . Something must have cracked on the inside because water is leaking out from the inside and running down the cable . Last night , a bit of water even sprayed up toward the ceiling off the top of the showerhead , but that stopped almost immediately . ( ? ? ? ) Obviously something is not right . Another reviewer had mentioned that the entire showerhead felt cheap ; when I read that , I agreed that it felt light , but I was n't sure that also meant cheap . Now , however , I would agree completely with that comment . Do n't waste your money .	-1
The pros of this shower head are that it is easy to install and the lights seem accurate and fun . We think the kids will really enjoy the lights.The product is however , not particularly well made . Materials , especially the mount , are cheap , low-grade plastic They seem prone to easy breakage.The stream diameter is really narrow ( about 2-3 inches ) and actually gets narrower once it leaves the showerhead . It 's also not adjustable . Big disappointment with that.We just installed this so will wait and see how it does with a lot of use by young kids and see if it holds up .	-1
UPDATE 2/2/2014 : After using this showerhead on a regular basis for about a year , it broke and became completely useless . For many months , the LED lights worked only sporadically and , more recently , only a trickle of water would pass through the shower head . I am guessing that the mechanism that powers the LED lights broke and eventually blocked the water flow . I originally rated this product with three stars and have lowered my rating to two stars . I would expect that a showerhead would be useful for more than one year and would definitely not recommend this one to anyone . My original review is below : * * * * *I had always determined whether shower water is the correct temperature by sticking my hand or foot in the water stream before jumping in . This procedure always seemed to work well , so I had doubts whether the LED illuminated lights in this shower head , showing water temperature , would be of any significant benefit . I was pleasantly surprised to find that it is convenient , when first turning the shower on , to keep tabs on the temperature without opening the shower door . So , I found this feature a plus , but once someone is immersed in the shower , I do not see any useful purpose to be served by the lights . The colors , however , do seem to accurately display the temperature ; blue when cold , green when warm , red when hot , and flashing red when scalding.The water pressure of the flow also seemed to be adequate . My biggest problem with this shower head is that the water stream is fixed in one configuration which focuses the flow into a fairly narrow area . My wife liked this narrow water stream , but I would have preferred a more disbursed flow . There are many showerheads on the market today for less money than this product , that have adjustable water flows . I do not know whether the LED light technology prevented HeathSmart from using an adjustable flow , but this would have been a desirable feature . On balance , I prefer my old showerhead with an adjustable water flow over this fixed flow with the LED lights - I just do not think that the lights are worth the tradeoff.This showerhead is made in China with lightweight plastic , so I question how long this product will hold up under frequent use . The plastic has a metallic appearance.The installation instructions state that a short strip of Teflon tape is needed to wrap around the shower stem , but no Teflon tape was included in the box . To make matters worse , neither the box nor the Amazon product description ( as of the date of this review ) state that Teflon tape is required for installation , but not included in the box . The cost of including the tape to HealthSmart would have been a matter of pennies , but for me , the absence of tape required a special trip to the hardware store and a delay of more than a week in installing the device . Once I bought the tape , installation took only a few minutes and went without any problems.The bottom line here is that the LED lights have some , but limited , utility . However , from my viewpoint , the lack of any adjustment to the water flow makes this showerhead less desirable than less expensive adjustable models .	-1
Updated review : I initially gave this a higher rating because the temperature detecting lights were a major plus to me Now they do n't work and that keeps the safety feature from being effective . Just as with our older shower heads , I have to wait , test the water with my hand , and then step into the shower .As far as the shower heads , they perform as well as any average one.No special bells or whistles but they can be used while in place or removed for greater flexibility for spraying off soap and suds from a number of angles . This is what our older units did so we were fine with getting the exact same function ... but not with the lack of lights ( as noted above ) The rest of my review is basically the same as the first one I wrote.The first head received was missing washers . The second came with all washers needed . Neither came with the suggested Teflon tapes . However , I do want to add that in one shower this did not seem to be needed as the seal was tight enough without it . In the other shower , it was needed.The basic shower head and shower connector is made of plastic so you do need to be gentle when putting the parts together . We felt that too much pressure might crack the plastic . That never happened to us , though , on either shower tested.The LumaTemp instructions do caution users that water pressures and temperatures can vary from one shower to another . Our experience was that the water pressure and spray was fine . You can not adjust the spray from gentle to strong . It is a set spray . It is strong enough for us , even though it ca n't be adjusted.We really like that the shower heads can be used in a fixed position or removed to direct the spray where we wanted.Now that we have all the parts , we will continue to use the Healthsmart . One of our old shower heads was leaking badly so the new one is a significant improvement . They work well enough for basic shower heads.. However , these would n't have been our first choice if we knew about all the pros and cons ahead of time ... .as well as the parts we 'd have to purchase .	-1
This is a terrible shower head . It is very cheaply made of plastic and the hose is way too short . The lights almost all went out after the third week of trial and the clear head holds a puddle of water all the time that looks terrible . The spray is very narrow from what I 'm use too , you have to move around to get wet . No pressure adjustment or shut off button . Ca n't wait to reinstall my Delta !	-1
This is a very bright light , and it is incredibly small . It earns two positive stars . A couple of drawbacks : Cost is high , the buttons for determining the mode the light is in are hard to understand , and once on , the light is very difficult to turn completely off . It wants to stay in a & # 34 ; sleep & # 34 ; mode where the little red LED flashes all the time , which I assume draws down the battery life . It was because of those three negatives that I sent it back . It would have been a much better product had the on/off functionality been intuitive .	-1
Bought the Kreg HD as soon as it was available and used it on a few small projects with no problem . Then came the framing of the basement . Over the course of a week , I put in about 50 studs . Today I drilled five studs when the tip broke.Because the Kreg HD is not in my local big box stores . I am out of luck for the weekend.I must say , I like the the Kreg system . I own both the 3/8th and the HD . But this is disappointing , especially since you ca n't simply go to the store and buy a replacement.I give it two stars because the bit should be better made , and Kreg should be able to get the replacement bits for the HD in local stores .	-1
These are not made for fine cabinetmaking ! Much too large and coarse ! Save your money , go to a local hardware store and buy a pack of & # 34 ; soldering brushes & # 34 ; in the plumbing section . Generally a pack of 4 or 5 costs just over a buck . If I rinse out the glue before it dries , the soldering brushes last indefinitely.I did buy these incidentally , and tried using one on a drawer glue up of hand-cut dovetails . Just way too large and messy . If you 're doing very large work , or like scraping glue squeeze-out off of the surface , then you may like these .	-1
The light was impressive in brightness . You can set it to dim when there is no motion . The dim setting is is like the level of moonlight and the bright is like a 60watt incandescent . I liked that you can set the sensitivity and length of time that the light stays on.Then , after a few days , it just stopped lighting up . I saw that battery had a voltage reading of 7.4v . I would guess that the controller has died or bad switch.I liked it enough to try again IF I see many positive reviews .	-1
Bought this bulb from a certain Cost Co store . Initial impressions were good . Bulb seemed well-made , light quality was very good as was the spread of light . After 6 hours the bulb started to flicker a bit . I thought this might have been a power quality issue , so I hooked up my Fluke meter . After 6 hours , the bulb went permanently dim to about as bright as a nightlight . SIX hours . That 's all it lasted . Glad I bought it where I bought it . I 'm returning ALL of the ones I bought . They 're obviously not ready for prime time yet .	-1
-Jesse Harris , in his review , says `` The 3000K color temperature is very close to a standard soft white incandescent making them almost interchangeable . `` I do not agree . The bulbs that I 've found that come closest to standard soft white incandescent have a color temperature of 2700K or lower ( I have not yet found one lower ) . This bulb emits light with a harsh bluish-white color.An explanation for this problem appears in Diztronic 's Comment to this Review . Worth reading.Also , read through all the reviews . Apparently FEIT has quality control issues . The brands that I 've had the best luck with to date are Phillips and CREE .	-1
PROS : -Relatively inexpensive , though there are several other A19 style bulbs at or around this same price-Cool looking heatsink-That 's it.CONS : Where do I begin ? ? -13.5W consumption for a 60W replacement , whereas competitors bulbs only take 9W for the same brightness ( 850 lumens ) . I thought maybe they would be a lot brighter than the 9w bulbs I have been using , but they put off the same amount of light - albeit a slightly different color.-These are supposed to be `` soft white '' but I feel they are more of a `` cool white '' . After further research I learned that they are 3000K compared to most other `` soft white '' bulbs which are 2700K ( as are incandescent ) . They really should list the color temperature in the specs.-When installed in a fixture controlled by a dimmer , the bulbs would all flicker at FULL brightness only . They were fine when about 95 % brightness or less , even dimmed all the way down to about 10 % , but at full brightness they flicker constantly . And it 's not the fixtures or the switches , because other LED 's work just fine in the same fixture.-They will not work PERIOD in a garage door opener . Turned it on , waited , nothing . And again , other LED 's work just fine in the opener.I do n't know why anyone would buy these when you can get very high quality CREE or EcoSmart bulbs at Home Depot for around the same price ( or even cheaper if bought in bulk ) . I have purchased over 40 of the EcoSmart and CREE bulbs and never had a single problem , I just gave these a shot to try something different . Big mistake . I should just stick with what I know works . Although , I did also get some of thePhilips 11-Watt A19 LED Bulbsand I was very pleased with those and they probably give off the most incandescent-like light of any LED that I have tried . But at $ 20 they are n't that much better to where I 'm willing to pay an extra 40 % more than the ones I have been getting from HD .	-1
Very solid feel to the bulb , primarily because it has a large metal base as a heat sink . The light , size and look of this bulb is fine , for the application I intended , but it gets very hot . Had planned to use it in a ceiling light fixture that is used for a number of hours each day , but seems too risky . Feit seems to make quality LED bulbs in some other sizes like BR40 , but it must be a challenge to make a standard A19 size bulb for under the $ 10 price , which seems to be the targeted price point for most manufacturers .	-1
Pro 's : * The bulbs have a good brightness and color-temperature* Available at Cost co ( good return policy ) Con 's : * The bulbs are very heavy , causing my table lamps to be top-heavy ( risk of falling over ) , and way too heavy for my desk task lamp . * The bulbs cause power line interference , disrupting X10 & Insteon power-line communications . Adding a power-line filter to each lamp seems to work , but is costly .	-1
I ordered & # 34 ; assuming & # 34 ; it was the same thing I ordered last year for a different door . I should have checked my order from last year first because this was terrible - the tape did n't stick , the magnets did n't line up . I reviewed my order from last year and returned THIS ONE - My other one that has functioned without fail since last summer was the & # 34 ; bug off & # 34 ; one . It has a springbar at the top instead of double sided tape as on THIS one . Much better product . It cost a few more dollars but it WORKS . At least in MY experience it works and has been in place for almost 12 months now so I would consider it a success .	-1
I bought this at the same time as a similar product from Premium at almost twice the price . I will not be buying this product again . It is cheap , the fabric is not sewn square to the seams , the glue does not hold , had to use the tacks . Once you nail it down it works OK in calm air , but wind blows it right open . It is in two halfs that must be installed separately , rather than simply making the top run all the way across like the Premium product.Do n't do it , pay another 10 $ and get something you will be happy with .	-1
Simply put , this screen is not durable . Construction is the key to its demise . With some tweaking it may be a good product but not as shipped . The screen attached to a doorway via velcro - one side is glued to the screen fabric and one side you attach to the doorway . The velcro is plenty strong . The glue works well with our doorway . The glue does not however stick to the screen fabric . Really ? this is basic product testing , especially in any sort of heat . Please understand , heat is not the issue . Heat causes it to fail in a couple minutes ( maybe ) . Even in cool weather it will only stay up for about 20 or 30 minutes.A few points to touch on : > Appearance : it 's hideous. > Magnets : they actually work. > Screen Length : make sure you measure the product length and your doorway to ensure it will fit . If the screen is too long , you have to cut it down otherwise the fabric will catch on the inside flooring of the house ( I have wooden floors not even carpet ) and keeps the flaps open , thereby letting all the bugs fly right in. > Did I mention the glue does not stick ? ? ?	-1
Dual-Band Dimmer , White ( Tools & Home Improvement ) SmartHome , the supplier of this and other Insteon devices , does not wish to exchange failed devices which fail due to well known design issues . In this case a KeypadLinc V2 which ceased to function properly due to the well known 'paddle malfunction ' was not allowed an exchange because , as the customer service rep stated , & # 34 ; these things fail after a while you know. & # 34 ; My entire home runs on Insteon devices . We have invested an enormous amount of money in them . At no time , during and prior to my purchases from SmartHome , was I ever warned that the devices which I was purchasing would & # 34 ; fail after a while , & # 34 ; and that SmartHome would not stand behind them when that happened . In this case we are talking about a period of approximately three years from the time of installation until failure occurred . SmartHome only warrants their Insteaon devices for a period of two years even in the case of a design fault.Before anticipating the purchase and installation of , perhaps , thousands of dollars worth of SmartHome Insteon equipment prospective purchasers should heed the words of SmartHome 's customer service rep : & # 34 ; these things fail after a while you know , & # 34 ; and recognize that SmartHome will not exchange Insteon components when they fail , even due to well known design issues.As usual & # 34 ; let the buyer beware ! & # 34 ;	-1
Whatever metal alloy is being used for the bits , it does not meet the standard for tools . Had some bits both chip and bend on the first use . One was a phillips head screw bit , being used on extremely soft screws with very little force . Considering the circumstances , this was very unimpressive.I regret that I had to return it . I DID like the case and the vast selection of bits . But what really matters if how long the bits will last , and I just ca n't recommend them .	-1
These bits are made in China and are of a low quality . I purchased a similar 100 pc security bit set from another big box store that specialized in products from China at 1/4 the price . The only reason I purchased this set is for the 5-point star bit that was not included in the other set I purchased . I would not recommend buying this set .	-1

Nitecore SENS AA was a waste of my time . First off , the head does n't even screw down far enough on mine to cover the metal beneath where the threads are ( aesthetics only I know ) . What 's even worse is that the light is turning on too soon and then to turn it off means a loose battery rattling around which makes this light something I would never carry . On top of all this , I have a SENS CR123 light which works perfectly ( which does make me wonder if I just got a bad AA version ) but in the end , through some testing with the Active Dimming Technology -- just by swinging my arm makes this light into somewhat of a strobe light while it dims down and jumps up to full brightness every once and a while ( and I do n't even swing my arms that much and my SENS CR does n't do this which is even more confusing ) . I guess this light just was n't a winner for me but if you are looking for a winner I found one over at countycomm dot com called the Maratac and it is awesome . Probably one of the best lights at this size around ( my pref is rev 3 at this time ) . As far as the SENS AA light ... If I know I wo n't carry it ... then I might as well return it .	-1
I bought this kit to open my 2012 MacBook Air 13 '' . I basically just needed a pentalobe driver to open the case , but I figured it might be a good idea to get an entire kit . I got this particular kit because it was getting many positive reviews and the ifixit reputation has been excellent.I had no trouble with the pentalobe bit , but the Torx T5 bit for removing componentry literally stripped on the second screw I applied the tool to . I thought at first it was the screw , but on careful inspection the tip of the bit was the culprit . I do n't know what kind of metal they make it out of , but I am sorely disappointed with this set . Granted the larger bits will likely have more strength , but my confidence in the toolkit and ifixit products was severely shaken . 1 star .	-1
The unit did not work out of the box . The digital display worked and the setting worked but the relays for both hot and cold did not make a circuit for the controlled device . I spent several hours making an enclosure only to be disappointed that the Elitech was defective . I should have suspected that all was not right when I could hear metal rattling inside the small box .	-1
The box jig works great . Not so good for Sawstop users . It has n't blown my safety ( $ 85 plus blade ) but close . They should clearly point out that the 'kiss ' adjustment lends itself to shorting out the Sawstop circuit.Update : I 'm now rating this 1-star for Sawstop users . An additional , significant Sawstop specific problem is that the manual and most iBox documentation claims that the user can make box-joints using 1 '' lumber . This is false , 1 '' fingers will trigger the brake . If you plan on using the jig for 1 '' material , turn off the braking system as the dado blades _will_ contact the interior of the jig ( true for the version that was available on 9/2013 ) . I know this for a fact as the ibox did contact my blade while cutting 1 '' fingers ; it did cost me $ 90 and a Forrest Dado King.Sawstop users , see [ ... ]	-1
We ordered these to protect furniture that gets moved around a lot . We were impressed with the rated 1 '' thickness in particular . When we got them , however , they were not much thicker than bed sheets . 1/16 '' - 1/8 '' thick . I do n't know how anything this thin could be expected to protect anything . Very disappointed that the description was blatantly wrong . Sent them back immediately .	-1
This is an ok moving blanket ... nothing to write home about . I bought three , used one , and returned the other two . It 's not worth the money . Plus , it 's only one blanket per package !	-1
This is about as useful as a bed sheet for protecting something , super thin and has a terrible chemical smell to it , I have purchased old wool surplus blanket that smell better than this and would supply more protection . This will get thrown in the back of the truck and be used as a range blanket to lay things on or collect spent shell casings .	-1
This respirator and its associated filters are functional . The mask is reasonably comfortable . But the buckle is pretty much impossible to release with one hand . And the drop down feature is a bad joke since you basically need three hands to put the mask back on , one to hold the mask on your face and one for each end of the strap to properly tension and buckle them . And when it is dropped down you ca n't do anything without having the mask swinging around in your way and potentially falling off of your head . The old AO Safety masks with the Quicklatch were far superior but unfortunately 3M bought out AO Safety and continued to use their own mask designs instead of using the designs of AO Safety which they presumably own now . If anyone from 3M reads this get someone to dig up those specs and bring back those easy to use respirators with the awesome Quicklatch feature .	-1
Good respirator , but be warned ! You will have to buy filter cartridges , and prefilter paper pads , and spend a stupid amount on the plastic retainers for those pads . This is poor marketing on 3M 's part . The retainers should be part of the prefilter package ; you ca n't use them without the retainer.Also , the elastic is thin and poor , in our machine shop we replace it with elastic bought from another supplier.The good part about these is the comfort of silicone , and the modular design that can be taken apart and cleaned .	-1
May have great filtering specs , but it the design prevents from fitting well , and let 's crap in , then the mask ai n't worth a crap ! This mask needs a re-design in order to fit more people ( I do not have a small face , but the bottom of this mask rides up over my chin , letting the stuff I want avoid in ) . Stay away from this one !	-1
I 'm lowering my rating from four to two stars . After a couple of months of use this thing got to where it would n't power up when I hit the button . New batteries did n't matter , I could smack it against the wall and it would light up again , but it was n't reliable and if you could get it to light up it would turn itself off after a few minutes . I 'm in the market for a new flashlight again . The overall design of this thing is great , it feels like a solid piece of equipment , but it 's unreliable. -- -- -- -- My original four star review follows -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -For my normal daily use this thing is great . I love the fact it has multiple modes , I like the fact that once it 's in a mode for a few seconds I do n't have to cycle through the rest to turn it off.It does not accidentally activate in my pocket like many other flashlights have done.On bright it 's blinding if it hits you in the eyes.The only flaw is that it overheats or something if you leave on for too long on bright . It gives out and just wo n't stay lit , granted it takes a while to get to that point , but I 've done it more than once . It takes an extended cool down period , and no it 's not a dead battery . The solution is to keep it on mode two , the less bright mode , if you plan on using it for an extended period . I 've never used the head mount other than to try it on , but I do keep it at work incase I have an emergency need for it if my bike headlamp gives out or something .	-1
It 's seems nice but it worked one minute then the next it did n't . Read other reviews where other users had problems and decided not to try this unit again . I really like the size and that it could be used for a head lamp . If you get one that works then be happy .	-1
I had a fairly indepth review of this light , but my opinion of this light has faded more and more.While the Light output on an 18650 is OK , it is no where near what is claimed.It is more blue than I like.3 new Nimh 's in the holder are perhaps 75 % as bright as the 18650The provided battery has no where near the claimed capacity . It actually says shelf lief 10 years on the shrink wrapping . I get about 1/10 the expected runtimes when run in a Nitecore HC50 when using this battery . I bet this battery is just taken from a used laptop battery pack and re shrink wrapped.There is no way it is water resistant , certainly not waterproof.It is annoying to use as there is no memory and you got to cycle through the different settings each time to get the one desired.While zoomable it is not wide enough at its widest , and not narrow enough at its narrowest , so less throw than expected.I regret this purchase.A note to those shopping for lights in this price range that think they are getting a deal when it is provided with a battery and a charger ... . The battery is likely used and rewrapped with a fraction of the claimed capacity.Li-ion batteries can be dangerous if overcharged . DO not trust these junky cheapo packaged chargers . If a battery fails serious lasting injury can result . If your first Foray into Li-ion batteries , do some research first on their correct treatment . Do not trust cheap chargers ! ! !

It does n't work when you need it to . The green power button gets pushed down inside the metal when you try to turn the power on , and the power wo n't turn on . It feels like a cheap p.o.s . The most important thing you can have in a flashlight is dependability ... this flashlight does n't have that .	-1
The one I got had a major defect , most likely in the circuit board . It automatically dims and flickers & turns off at random . I am guessing that this was cheaper than compared to the same product offered by other sellers is because the seller wants to clear a defective batch of these flash lights . Well , there are many good reviews of this product that are OLD , but then again me getting a defective product might just have been bad luck .	-1
Ordered this in mid Nov and its apr 23 and still did n't receive item sent them a email and they said to let them try and fix this problem but as of today still no flashlight ! ! its been FIVE ( 5 ) MONTHS that 's right FIVE MONTHS I could have walked it from China to Hawaii in five months lol but all kidding aside I know this item was on the cheap side but I still wanted it cause I collect flashlights Im very disappointed I do n't even know if its been paid for but I guess for under $ 10 bucks I can take the loss will never order from them again ! !	-1
This flashlight and others like it just do n't measure up . I 've gotten ten of the various lights on Amazon and this version is the worst so far . Some people do n't like the funky 18650 batteries but I love em . I think it 's a great form factor . These will take 3 AAA or one 18650 . Problem is the LED jus ios n't as good as the ultrafire type lights .	-1
If this is 1600 LM 's they are sorely mistaken . I would guess maybe 300 or so ? I ended up returning it and would not recommend it if you truly want a 1600 LM light	-1
The battery lasts only about 30 minutes , one hour on lowest setting , Then it starts to dim and draw more energy than the battery can handle.I will have to add a large pack of cells on the out side of the light . Maybe even put a smaller LED in it . The batterys are not protected enough , they can explode : [ ... ] Read this one also ! [ ... ] get these batterys and a much better chargerB00C26OWGSGet a better charger , it 's worth the money . Also the LED does not have a voltage regulator , that makes it burn bright for a short time , then fades .	-1
I had gone through two of these that the seller sent to me and both flashlights failed to work after two days . I have other CREE products that worked fine just not this one .	-1
Checked the output compared to a 300 Lumen flashlight I had ordered and was surprised that the 300 lumem one was brighter . That coupled with needing 3 AAA batteries compared to 1 AA in the 300 lumen one left me disapointed . Wo n't buy another one thats for sure .	-1
$ 10wasted . I do n't have a luminometer , but I have another 200 lumen LED light ( by Rosewill , bought at another site ) that is basically the same as this one . And I paid the same for both . This one has a 'dim ' mode , as well as multiple flashing modes , which could be nice , but it is also a pain to toggle through all the settings until the 'bright ' setting kicks in . Ouch ... I ca n't believe I bought this ... maybe my 'lumen ' testosterone blinded me to the reviews , which I normally scrutinize carefully . If you want a toy flashlight , get one of the $ 5 ones . Caveat emptor !	-1
While CREE LEDS are awesome , if they are underpowered ... that 's a problem.This is completely useless as a flashlight because you only use one battery . Sure it is 'zoom-able ' but at mid 'zoom ' the light is so disbursed it is completely useless . I tried different batteries and it did not help .	-1
The flashlight casing is ok but the charger unit is junk . I put a battery in it and it began to stink and get hot . I already threw it out . The batteries , in a correct quality charger will not charge . Do n't buy this particular product from this buyer !	-1
This flashlight is a joke . It has nowhere near 1600 lumens , does n't even come with a battery , took 6 weeks to arrive , was packaged about as poorly as it could have been , looks to be either used or damaged as there is paint missing from the item . All in all I would not recommend this item to anybody for a multitude of reasons .	-1
This 1600 Lumen is not much brighter them the 400 Lumen I already have . The light is n't as white either - more a bluish color . I actually can see better with the 400 lumen . No instructions at all are included . When I first stumbled on the strobe feature I thought it had broken . It 's actually a good feature but they should tell you how to turn it on & off . It actually will flash an & # 34 ; SOS & # 34 ; signal on demand.Overall not a bad light but the 400 lumen I have cost less then half as much , gives a better light & is a LOT smaller .	-1
I 've ordered 4 of these and two have worked and two have n't . Essentially that 's a 50 % failure rate and makes me wonder how long the other two are going to last . The light itself is extremely bright and the case is sturdy . I 'd just be wary of getting this one because of the number of defective items I 've received . Most of these ship from China so it takes a long time for delivery . If you have Amazon Prime - I 'd recommend ordering that way in the event you have to return a defective item within the initial return period .	-1
This flashlight has 5 modes : bright , medium , dim , strobe and SOS . SOS ? Seriously ? That 's just dumb , but what 's really annoying is that modes are selected by turning it off and on . So , if you turn it off , put it in the drawer , and later turn it on , you wo n't remember where you 're starting . It would have made more sense to always start from bright , and cycle to the less used modes . The way it works , you need to cycle through all 5 modes to figure out where you are.This is not a flashlight - it 's a toy . You have to fiddle with a toy to get it to work . A flashlight is light when you need it , without a lot of fiddling .	-1
It is reasonably bright , and maybe 400 lumens , but certainly not 1600lm , especially since the XM-L only supports 1000 Lumens to begin with : [ ... ] To get to 1000 lumens , the power supply needs to deliver 3000mA to the LED with a forward voltage of 3.35V For those of you paying attention , P = V*I = 10W needed to hit 1000 lumens.Now lets look at the real numbers.. With a charged 3.9V lithium battery , ( which a decent buck/boost supply should be able to use to deliver 3000mA ) the flashlight draws 1.36A . A quick calculation says that is at most 5.1W , and that does n't account for ANY inefficiencies in the power supply , which are probably on the order of 25 % losses.With 100 lumens/watt , this flashlight may be delivering at-most 400 Lumens.It 's a nice flashlight , but please make your product description more reasonable .	-1
The advertising is misleading for this flashlight and I have 140 lumen flashlights that are brighter . It was very disappointing especially with the photos they posted . You think you 're going to get a spotlight and end up with a penlight is the feeling you get . The flashlight is a good quality one just not anywhere near close to what it is advertised at for brightness . I would consider it a good deal if it was about $ 10 instead of the $ 23 I spent . I purchased a Lighting Ever Flashlight that is brigher and under $ 10.Lighting EVER Adjustable Focus CREE LED Flashlight , Super Bright , 3 Brightness Level Choices*After comparing it to the Lighting EVER flashlight I returned this supposed 1600 lumen one for a refund .	-1
I purchased this exact same light on another site for $ 12 , its `` OK '' for that price , however its the dimmest light I have now and for the price this is listed at , its definitely 1/5 stars and a DONT BUY . On wide it gives you a relatively nice wide beam for walking in the dark or close work , but it is not very bright compared to most LED lights . Its focus gives you a square LED image projection at a reasonable distance , but thats *IT* , it would not be good for biking or running at night ( try targeting a small lighted square while doing either ) . It 's 1600 lumens if I 'm Superman , and so far I cant fly , cut things with my eye beams , change the world 's spin , or deflect bullets . But I can lift cars ( with some help ) so ... . 1/5 theme is correct ... . yes 1/5 the lumens it claims , 1/5 stars !	-1
When I bought this product I thought it was great when I received there some missing pieces form the flashlight cause I ca n't even use it for long time now	-1
Been an Amazon customer for a number of years , however , they messed up on this one . I received the oiler but it looked like one that had been previously used and returned . In fact , it had oil all over the inside of the packaging . It was a mess , never ended up trying it , just returned it and cleaned up the mess .	-1
The picture does this product *way* too much justice . The product picture shows flames against a deep black background . In reality , the background is white . This along with the fact that they do n't supply enough of the white rocks to fully cover the bottom of the & # 34 ; fireplace & # 34 ; and it makes for a really cheap looking fireplace.We wall mounted ours in the bedroom and mounted it a bit higher than the suggested height with no problems . Visually , you 'll of course have a big cord hanging down from it ( which is n't centered on the unit ) . There 's not too much adjustment in the bracket to account for finding studs . Unlike most flat panel TV wall mounts , you pretty much have to hand this wherever the holes in the bracket line up with a stud , or you can take your chances with drywall anchors . Because of the heater , you ca n't encase it in wood or other materials to dress up the look from the sides . It 's about 6 & # 34 ; deep , so it protrudes a decent amount from the wall.You can turn on the fireplace look without running the heater , but not vice-versa , which is a shame . Another pretty poor aspect is that the heater only runs high or low , and there 's no thermostat , so it 'll just keep on pumping out heat no matter how hot the room actually gets.The multiple colors are simply a gimmick supplied by the RGB LEDs . There 's really only two realistic settings - the full orange and the orange mixed with red . All the other combos just look weird . The flame effect is weak . It uses a rotating drum with lights shining through it , so it 's not very random and the motor that drives the thing is actually pretty loud.The remote is ok , but it has an annoying beep every time you press a button.My first unit arrived and was obviously dropped pretty hard . The metal casing was badly dented and the white plastic background was completely cracked . Luckily the glass was intact . I contacted the company and they sent me a replacement without any hassles.All in all , while it works , I think the product pictures are misleading and it lacks some pretty simply features to make it useful , especially for the price .	-1
This tool is sold as a small home job `` fix it '' tool and for that it might be ok.However , the screwdriver on the handle can be dangerous if the user should fall for any reason by becoming a lance since the pointed screwdriver nib is in place all the time . In addition there is a non-refillable razor knife in the handle which by being non-refillable is really dumb . Then here is the flex extension ... .will you be able to find this tool when you need it ? ? ? ? ? The quality of this tool is marginal since I had to repair mine the first job I tried to use it on . The holding magnet came loose from inside the screw driver socket , which if lost , would have rendered the screw driver useless.Overall this is not one of Cresent tools better ideas . I rate it as a `` Do n't Buy '' .	-1
I was not happy with this at all . Not a good BR30 replacement . I think someone can come up with something better .	-1
We wanted to love this bulb , but it gives of a glare at all angles that makes it unusable if you look in its direction . In the right fixture , angled completely away from view , or if you have a dimmer , it might be OK . However , it was too bright for us ( and we do n't have a dimmer ) .	-1
Ordered and received 14.5W ( 75W equivalents ) and they are actually dimmer than 6.5W ( 40W equivalent ) 5000 deg temperature bulbs I bought elsewhere . Not only did they ship the wrong bulbs , but the light output is false . To make matters worse , they are over priced . I would not pay $ 3 for these.I 've purchased four different types of bulbs in three temperatures , and four wattage sizes . I have lots to compare to these pathetic bulbs . They do not put out 800 lumens . Not even close . If I were to guess , I 'd say they put out 400 lumens . The 2700 deg temp is too warm . Never go less than 3000 degree . I do not find 5000 deg temperatures to be harsh at all.I can only guess that people like these who purchased them , and rated them higher , did not have a reference to compare them too except for incandescent bulbs -- and they are an improvement over those for electrical demand only.I am returning them because they are dim and faint looking , and purchasing the other brand 6.5W 5000 deg bulbs for $ 6.99 that I bought from a major online computer parts supplier . I was limited to five at a time and would gladly pay the normal price of $ 7.99 for more . For the cost of five of these , I can have 14.5 of the other bulbs on sale.If these were anywhere near decent lamp bulbs I 'd keep them and avoid the hassle of returning them . They are a huge disappointment to me . I might consider this flood type bulb , which can be used outside , if the color temperature was 5000 degrees and they put out the rated light output.I have to wonder , given the fact that they shipped the wrong bulbs that perhaps there was a bad lot of one type and these might be some sort of manufacturers defect being off'ed on an unsuspecting public . If that is the case , then Philips is going to lose a lot of business . I expected better of Philips and I 'll be calling their corporate headquarters and complaining directly to them . I do n't think that is the case . I only opened one of the five . I would try another bulb package if I honestly thought it would make a difference.While I did like the yellow color , I find I would much rather have the bright white bulbs . Yellow is a poor choice for an outdoor flood . For an indoor flood , if you are looking for an architectural cooler look , these mightI would much rather have bright bulbs . These have a very limited appeal . All I can say is that in a face off with a 5000 deg white bulb of half the wattage , these are a a quick decision to return.Final thoughts : It is winter and I 'm trying to reduce our light bill at a time of the year when lights are left on longer . I 've spent over $ 300 on light bulbs and looking for a long term payoff . These higher priced bulbs have been a big disappointment . Shop around and go `` all-in '' on LED . Not only is it green , the payback period is not that long if you can find reasonably priced bulbs on sale . Cost should be under $ 10 per bulb.I have become a true believer in LED bulbs right down to some small ceiling fan LED bulbs I bought that are 3000 degree , 120 lumen 3 watt bulbs that I 'm using for a vanity , and front door recessed lighting . These cost $ 7.50 . I 'd say 3000 degree is the warmest temperature bulbs I 've seen , and otherwise recommend 5000 degree bulbs for most , if not all , applications . Also , the 5000 degree bulbs placed in a table lamp turn a warm color via the lamp shade . If could do it over I 'd buy 5000 deg LED 's in that wattage also . Out of ten of those I had one lamp that failed in a few minutes , the others work great .	-1
I 'm looking for an LED bulb to replace my recessed incandescent bulbs for warmer months . I give this bulb 2 stars because the beam is too narrow and there is sideways glare as compared to my current incandescents.On the positive side the bulb is brighter than my regular 65 watt bulbs . But the spot beam is too narrow and not as diffuse as my regular bulbs . At the same time the bulb has sideways glare that my regular incandescents do not . Though if you typically use frosted recessed bulbs that produce moderate sideways glare at the tip you wo n't mind this LED bulb .	-1
IF you are looking for a replacement R-30 type flood , then these are not for you.I returned and purchased the ( 2700-3000K ) and they look almost identical.Phillips makes a nice LED but just make sure you get the correct color as in ( soft , warm , daylight ) I found that ( 2700 - 3000K ) look very close to what we are used to seeing in our homes.10 time better than the CFL . These get very hot and I have had issues with them lasting.We shall see how the LED 's last .	-1
I 've seen many reviews on this product in great detail so I will not do the same . I rated this low because it is just too long for my application . I have around 40 can lights in my home requiring flood lights . I have been using the Phillips brand in short and long neck versions for years and been pleased . I purchased this light to try it out , and found that it is much longer than the long neck bulbs I have been buying . When inserted in the can , it sticks out below the ceiling line . Apparently , there are can lights out there that these will work with , but if you have ceiling can lights , pay attention to the length of the bulb .	-1
Installed this LED bulb in a recessed fixture within 6 feet of another recessed fixture holding a `` traditional '' GE soft white 65W R30 incandescent . I 'm no GE fan , but in comparing these two bulbs , I found this LED bulb to be much bluer in color , and uncomfortably so . It 's also a bit brighter , which would normally be a good thing , but with the hotter color , I needed to dim it a bit . I found when I dimmed it a lot , it switched prematurely from on to off , while the incandescent could still be dimmed to much lower output levels.So if you ever have the desire to turn the the lights down low , you might find you ca n't achieve the same ambiance or lighting quality with this LED bulb . I have read that the poor dimmability might be due to my dimmer ( about 5 years old ) not being designed to dim LED 's . Yet neither this bulb 's advertisement on Amazon nor its bulb 's packaging said anything about a need to replace my dimmer to be able to dim this bulb in an equivalent manner to an incandescent . Instead , the Amazon ad asserts `` Dims just like an incandescent bulb '' . That assertion is at best misleading , and potentially an intentional misrepresentation .	-1
This bulb , the 200 lumen version , died after about 4 months of use . Noticeably short of the advertised 22.8 years . Used maybe 4 hours a day , 5 days a week . Ran through anAPC Back-UPS ES 550 ( orAPC Back-UPS ES 550 BE550Gfor more reviews ) , the same one used for my computer , I would think the bulb was reasonably well protected from power surges and other electrical gremlins . My best guess is it failed from heat or dimmer incompatibility . Very expen $ ive for such a short lifespan . Not a good return on investment.I 've received a replacement on March 16 , 2014 . Hopefully , it will last a little longer .	-1
Over the last 5 years I have bought something like 300 LED bulbs . Of those I still have about 60 in daily service.One of the most challenging bulbs to replace has been the MR11 type bulb . There are many styles on the market but there is a HUGE standardization issue . Many of the MR11 's coming out of China are not truly G4 compatible . ( The differences are pretty basic G4 just means the pins are 4.0 mm apart and they ca n't be more than 0.75mm in thickness ) .Some of the bulbs I have bought here on Amazon or on Ebay come with the thicker pins that are farther apart similar to the ones on a MR16 bulb.This bulb features a dual LED array I plugged it into my Halo , Linea low voltage track and compared it to several MR11 LED 's from different Chinese sources and to a 20 watt halogen bulb from Philips.As expected the halogen bulb produced the best quality of light . Cool and crisp easy to use light that works for task lighting as well as for reading and accent lighting . The Philips comes in second . Light wise it produces a too yellow for my taste dull color that makes the red paint on one of my office wall look much redder . The Philips package states a color temperature of 2700k . I have to disagree with that when compared to a Philips A19 ( E27 ) LED bulb with the same color temperature rating its like night and day with the MR11 looking several shades yellower than it should.Now for me this puts me in a bind . When I buy 3 watt MR11s on ebay , I can get 20 for about $ 120 , when compared to the Philips bulbs the Philips is definitely 10-15 % brighter but the bulbs also cost $ 24 EACH . So as an example if I were to replace JUST the bulbs in the family room I would need 36 of these bad boys at a cost of $ 827.00 ! whereas 40 of the cheap Chinese bulbs run me under $ 240.00.So are they better ? Having bought 1 bulb so far and running it for 5 hours a day for the last few weeks I have to say no . I think if the color were a bit cooler and more closely matched the Halogen bulb I might be cool with it , but right now I 'm going to say its overpriced and falls short of meeting expectations.Lastly Philips claims this bulb will save you $ 45.38 per bulb over the LIFE of the bulb . ( 22.8 years ) and we need to be honest about that . Bulb technology is ever changing . The newest and greatest in LED is COB fixtures ( chips on Board ) These bulbs are quickly expanding in market share and you will see these available within the next year . So to say that you are going to use THIS bulb for 22 years is a HUGE stretch . To be more realistic you would probably use the bulb for 5-7 years and then something bigger and better will come along and they will end up in the trash like all the disposable electronics that we surround ourselves with daily.So my final answer ? If you can afford them great , Otherwise look for a better deal on the cheap ones.Pros : Brighter than most MR11 LED'sSmall compact size almost identical to halogen 's footprintCons : Very high costVery yellow color********************************************************************************************************************************A BETTER ALTERNATIVE****************************************Ledwholesalers Brightest Angle Light 1127WWAbout my reviews.I have a pretty basic rating system3 stars = meets expectations , in order words it does what its supposed to do.1 & 2 stars = fails to meet expectations , does n't cut the mustard.4 & 5 stars = exceeds expectations .

This product BOASTS smart chip-controlled USB ports ( plural ) . LOL . What a joke . I like Leviton a lot , but this foray into the consumer electronics market is a flop IMO . First , throughout the instructions , it says it features `` two 5VDC - 2.1A DC powered USB ports '' ( plural , again ) . I understand that there is a lame limitation of a combined 2.1 amps , which is inexcusable in today 's modern age . With the `` smart '' technology , I figured I would , at least , be able to charge two 1A phones at the same time.We have a household of gadgets from iPods and iPads to Android phones and tablets and even a Kindle . I was really looking forward to simplifying all the dongles and fighting wires . Not so . First , the only thing that would charge above the basic 500mA ( 1/2A ) is our iPad 2 . Sure , it 's `` compatible '' with most of the other stuff ( except not Asus Transformer BTW ) . That is no better than the slow charging I can get from any port on a computer , laptop , netbook , or nowadays cheap alarm clock , car charger , etc. , or even the Asus Transformer itself . ( Currently , we have a cheap 4-port USB dongle for low-power/low-priority devices . ) Furthermore , the iPad 2 would only charge while using the right port . Sure , the instructions say that the right port is optimized for `` larger battery devices '' ( not that I found that to be the case ) but then why claim this has two 2.1A ports ? There is nothing smart that I could find about this product . Only the right port seems hard-wired to support some iPads -- and it 's not even labeled as such.Considering the cost and effort to rewire your outlet ( s ) and that manufacturers are constantly changing their products , I can not honestly say this product is worth the money and effort , especially that Leviton grossly overstated this product 's capabilities . I might be willing to give it 2 stars if they clearly stated that this was just a 1/2A charger x2 ports with the limitation that the right port is clearly marked somehow as also compatible with the iPad 2 at 2.1A and there is nothing smart about it and that by using the right port with an iPad , you can not use the left port to charge an iPhone just like they have in the picture . But , they did n't .	-1
After installing above my kitchen counter , I was struck by the inelegant appearance of the output . The USB ports look like huge gaping holes . After looking at it for a moment , I realized the plastic piece inside each USB port was black instead of white . This is horrible for the overall appearance . Looking online now at the white colored one I ordered , I see I looks much nicer in the picture because all of the plastic is uniformly white .	-1
The USB openings are a lot larger looking than they appear in the photo . There is no indicator light when it is being used . It also buzzed a little . Mine came back out and hit the trash can .	-1
Edits first : I am very disappointed with the longevity of this device . My original enthusiasm was badly misplaced . Installed in May , 2013 , failed totally in February 2014 . It is used only on weekends in our vacation house . Having tried several charging cords , several devices ( phones/tablets both ) and both USB outlets it is clear these ports no longer work at all . I will now have to remove and discard this receptacle , and replace the receptacle with a new standard plug pair . I no longer recommend this purchase.Old review : This is a perfect product for any modern house . This receptacle is very high quality and works perfectly with cell phones ( popular A-brand and all others tried ) and tablets ( same mix ) . You might want to buy a spare cable to make charging even easier to manage if you want to charge your phone in more than one place . A good purchase for our house !	-1
The other reviewers covered their experiments with this device and shared their compatibility discoveries ... I 'm not so patient ... a device that claims to charge tablets including iPads should simple do that , this one does not , or only will under certain circumstances that at not described in the 'documentation ' included with the device . For a mere $ 5 more the cooper wiring devices TR7745 ( available here on amazon ) not only offers dual 2.1a USB outputs but manages to so without giving up a 110v socket in the process . Leviton is a quality supplier , but this device is beneath them . There are better soultions available , there is no reason to consider this choice .	-1
If you have bad belts in an older piece of technology , do n't plan on using this to make them better.If the belts are obviously dirty , this will help . But so will denatured alcohol.This was a failed experiment to fix a slipping belt . Ended up buying a new belt .	-1
I did not like the color of these bulbs . It was an odd WHITE that stuck out like a sore thumb and didnt match any of the other bulbs on the first floor . I tried to live with it buyt couldnt . One of the 3 was also DOA out of box . Fortuntely easy to return with amazon !	-1
I placed two of these in a garage door opener . I note that there is some vibration , and frequent turn-on/turn-off . However , the hours of operation are minimal . The bulb is stated to be vibration proof and shockproof . It is stated to have a 3-yr warranty . According to the Lighting Ever web site , the warranty requires shipping the bulb back to them for warranty repair or replacement . To ship a $ 10 bulb back for repair or replacement is not something I 'm willing to do.The good : * The color is a cool white , which is reasonably close to the 4100K fluorescents in the garage . The color would be unacceptable to me in my living area . * The efficiency is decent . * Low heat does not discolor plastic diffuser . * Shape and light distribution are excellent.The bad : * One failure out of two in 8 months of intermittent operation . The failure is either the electronic driver , or an intermittent connection . The LED 's light well , but are constantly rapidly blinking . Occasionally , the bulb worked properly.The purpose of using LED bulbs in the garage door opener was to have low heat and low maintenance . Typical opener diffusers discolor ( yellow ) with incandescent bulbs . The low wattage LED bulb does not . A compact fluorescent is not capable of many starts and low run-times/start -- the electrodes fail . Thus , an LED bulb is best for this use . Regrettably , this bulb failed after very little service . I will be staying with the & # 34 ; big three & # 34 ; from now on -- Philips , Osram-Sylvania , and GE .	-1
My rating is based on my user experience , not the quality/integrity of the product . Maybe that 's a little unfair , maybe not.A couple of cons I experienced with this bulb in the 7 days I used it:1 . I learned the hard way with this product that it is DIRECTIONAL light . Do n't buy this unless you can aim the bulb at what you need lit . Being the problem solver I am , I ended up lining my lampshade with aluminum foil and capping the top of it too , forcing the light downward to my workstation . No big deal really , but it 'd be really nice if that was in the description.2 . The color and intensity of this bulb made my head feel like it was going to explode with a migraine-level headache , so those who are sensitive to light , BEWARE ! It 's not really an overly pleasing color quality either.I did n't use it long enough to see if it wore out after 30 days as other people have stated . I went back to CFL 's and have n't experienced any issues .	-1
This bulb does not put out the light a regular 75 or even 60 wattbulb does . Very unidirectional also . Would not order again .	-1
Now I have to figure out how to get a refund from the manufacturer since it 's beyond amazon return , but I may try calling them . This bulb started to blink after being outside in -6 degree F. It 's rated for -13 . Rather stark white too .	-1
I bought this light to replace a 60W/13W CFL that I use in a floor lamp that reflects light off the ceiling . LEDs are strange . They give the appearance that they 're very bright when you look at them straight on but they do n't act like CFL or incandescent . They do n't through light very far out and there for did n't work as well for my application . The light lights up the ceiling well but far less light reflects back down to the floor .	-1
As you can see , the base is a bit weired looking . I figured its no big deal , but when I got it , it really doesnt look nice in a fixture , and is larger than a regular or other LED bulbs on the market . Also gives off very strong cool white light .	-1
These were yellow and had a delay when the switch was turned on . if you want the bright whit you need to look for 3000- 6000 K anything less is yellow	-1
I just got these bulbs for some outdoor lights I use a lot . I love them . All I want to do now is to get my whole house switched over to led bulbs . These are for lights that were using 100 watts cfl , and these are so much brighter . I love the daylight bulbs because they do n't make anything look weirdly colored . I really love these so far , they are bright , great daylight blue hue and I am really excited to buy more.Update 5/2014Well I love the blue/ true white color and I loved the price but ( just like many others ) all my bulbs I bought have gone out . It started with a little flickering , and I thought it was the light fixture , got that checked out and it was ok. Then thought it was just the wiring , not the case , so I switched the bulbs to different light fixtures and the flickering kept on going . Then it went from flickering to just shutting off for minutes at a time then popping back on . How sad , and what a waste of my money ! !	-1
I ordered 10 of these . Nine of them seem to be OK but one stopped working in about a month . Of course , it was one that was located in a very high , hard to reach place.Lets see how long the others last . My expectations are sort of low .	-1
Way too bright a lught for the livingroom . Looks fluorescent . Yuk.Suitable for a basement shop or maybe on an enclosed porch .	-1
If you are going to use these type of LED bulbs , please be aware that the light is only at the tip of the bulb unlike the conventional bulbs . So , if you are using this for a table lamp , do n't expect the entire shade to light up . I returned mine after I screwed it in .	-1
I have been waiting 2 weeks for this to show up . Still do n't see it anywhere . The company does not tell us its going to take a month or more . Even if they shipped it out of China it would not take this long . I have asked for my money back and will keep asking until I get the purchase price . I think it very unfair to sell that way .	-1
Well ... obviously a cheating vendor . Adjust your listing and I will remove my review with a pleasure . Be honest to your consumer , do n't cheat your way to the top sellers ! First of all - 6000 Kelvin is a very very very blueish light , waaay to cool for home - minor thing , just keep this in mind people . I do n't want to mention competitors , so they wo n't say this is competitor review , but other bulbs offer 2700K and 3000K for a reason , people . 6000K is not yery friendly light , and it will not match any other bulb in your home or office.Now the major lie - 7Watt , 630Lumen ... how can this replace 60W incandescent ? ? ? 60W incandescent is 800-850 Lumen . 630 Lumen will barely replace 50W . If we convert that same led bulb into decent 3000K the lumen number will fall to approximately 500-520 . This bulb should not even be compared to incandescent , because whoever uses incandescent will not accept 6000K Blue light as a replacement . Even if we compare with Philips top selling bulb , they have 800 kelvin 2700K bulb , which is indeed a replacement for 60W incandescent , but there is a whole 200 Lumen gap between these two.6000K light temperature is most of the time much brighter that 3000K , however - 3000K is what our eye likes . 6000K For me is a no-go , unless I want to ruin my eye retina and get a horrible eye-strain . Dont get me wrong , 6000Kelvin is of course a bad thing , but supplier honestly says - the bulb is 6000K ; the reason for 1 star is only the watt and lumen statement . Please adjust and I will delete this review . There is a way to sell and to be honest in the same time .	-1
These lights were advertised as daylight white . In fact they have a very blue and somewhat harsh light . If you want a lot of light and don & # 8217 ; t mind them being closer to florescent bulbs , they should work .	-1
Very bright and nice light pattern but the bulbs i received are n't warm white ( box clearly marked warm white ) plus one takes longer to light up and flickers after that . I purchased a bunch of other bulbs here on Amazon and also eBay ( HK/China ) and DX . So far my favorite ones are Sunthin 5w GU10 warm white and TorchStar 5w GU10 warm white . the Sunthin COB LED 's have the best light pattern and color temp is almost identical to my regular 50w halogens . TorchStar was a dollar cheaper when i purchased ( but same price right now ) so i will wait till they are under $ 7 to stock up . I have a 6head track in hall and two 3head in closets . Just now started to switch to LED 's from halogens , will update review on how long these last.BTW , out of 6 bulbs i got from HK-DX none are really warm white . All have that blue `` daytime '' white tint to them just like these Lighting EVER .	-1
There is nothing on the site that states these are not dimmable . I ordered several , and the color is great as is the coverage . Then I ordered another 4 - only to finally put in a dimmer and voila ! ! flicker , flicker , flicker.The ONLY thing that states non dimmable is a very tiny ( 18 inch ) symbol on the side of the box that shows a line through a rotary dimmer . Thats it.DO NOT get these if you want to dim them .	-1
Not warm , does not fit my socket perfectly , and does not dim very well . When will this light bulb chaos be over ?	-1
Good light but it is not the equivalent of 50W bulb . Far away from that . To be to that level you need at least a 7W LED bulb .	-1
Most of these bulbs do not even work but just blink when installed . Money down the drain . The local home supply stores may be a bit more expensive but they ALL work . Do n't buy these .	-1
Ok , the straw that comes with the can is supposed to help you reach spaces that normally you can not reach . I made sure it was tightly placed and followed the instructions . However , after a second of starting to use it . the extension straw went flying like a bullet and the foam fell almost all over the place . It was a Pink Panter funny moment alright .	-1
The tube that holds the pencil literally broke off from the compass body as I inserted the pencil the first time from two very small incorrect welds . This thing was a complete waste of money .	-1
The price was too good to be true . The LED 's give off a warm pink color , they are not warm white .	-1
Z-wave enabled is only technically true . I have been totally unsuccessful at getting the parameter settings go enable the more sophisticated functions . Therefore , if you ever plan to use it with Vera or Homeseer , you will only be able to get the very basic functionality . Yeah , it might be able to do many things but I can not find the way to do them . Especially irritating is that it can not be linked directly to other devices . It is 100 % dependent on the base controller ( which means about a 2 second delay from sense to turning on the light ) . They should stop claiming Z-wave enabled and say Nexia only with reduced functionality with any other system . .	-1
I was looking for a standalone Z-wave motion sensor to be used indoors for my home and I came upon this product . From what I 've read from other reviewers , this product DOES work with Vera3 , but being a VeraLite owner , I 've had issues with this product . Let 's go into the cons:1 ) Build : the product is made of cheap plastic , and to open the cover , you need to jam a tiny screwdriver and use a great deal of force to lift off the cover , nearly breaking the plastic tab in the process . Why the manufacturer did n't use screws boggles my mind , and when you need to remove the cover to & # 34 ; wake up & # 34 ; the device ( due to it being battery operated ) , repeating this process many times is not only cumbersome but extremely annoying.2 ) The device options are not listed on Schlage 's website , nor in the instructions , so custom variable settings is either a ) not possible or b ) a guessing game . So for example , you would think that when motion is detected , the unit will report back , & # 34 ; Tripped & # 34 ; , and after a few seconds , go back to & # 34 ; Untripped & # 34 ; , right ? Wrong . The second signal does not go back to VeraLite , which will leave the console / scene to believe that the sensors is constantly & # 34 ; Tripped & # 34 ; when it really is n't . Only after the device is re-polled does the status go back to & # 34 ; Untripped & # 34 ; . This defeats the purpose of using this unit for scene triggers.3 ) Price . For a standalone Z-wave motion sensing unit , this product is overly priced4 ) Size . This unit is actually quite large and again I 'm puzzled why manufacturers ca n't decrease the size of these units considering the motion sensor itself ( with the cover off ) is 1/8 & # 34 ; square.Pros:1 ) None .	-1
On the positives : I 've had this for about 6 months now and have not yet had to change the batteries and it sync 'd with my Vera 3 like clockwork.As Z-wave sensors go , this one is like most of the others . Cheap made , unsightly , and limited by its batteries . This sensor follows the trend of the market , its no better or worse than the majority , but they made zero effort to make this product stand apart.A few months ago , though , I would have given this item four stars.. since I would have thought it to be as good as any other . That is , until I met this guy : B008D5TYGUFor about $ 10 more you get four sensors in one , and it has a A/C option so you can forego the limitations imposed by battery operated Z-wave devices.So , I will never buy another one of these so long as that Aeon 4-in-1 is on the market .	-1
The Sinclair Card Sharp knives sold by Cartoon Castle are cheap fake knock offs . I have purchased a number of these knives , from various suppliers , as gifts . The ones that came from Cartoon Castle are NOT marked Sinclair on the knife , and have the features changed considerably .	-1
Out of the packaging it was n't sharp at all . The steel is not impressive.It does fit in a standard wallet . It just adds a bit of bulk . The plastic is fairly durable.When working in a storage room , I like to have a small knife ready . If my usual cutting tool is n't available , I have a backup . I 'd describe this as a backup 's backup . I much preferred to have something like a Spyderco Bug on my keychain hanging from a belt loop ready to cut as a backup . You might go to this Cardsharp if it 's literally the only thing you have on you.I ended up just leaving this out of my wallet . The added bulk was n't justified by what this product brings to the table . I would recommend getting a tiny keychain knife before getting this .	-1
You wo n't be out much if you buy one , but this thing , which is supposed to be made of & # 34 ; surgical steel & # 34 ; , is not sharp in the least . Despite the stupid warnings to the contrary.It 's time-consuming to deploy . Maybe if you 're a diplomat kidnapped by terrorists , this might do you some good . But really ... . I have no faith in the piece of junk .	-1
I hate it because it 's a piece of crap . I hate pieces of crap and you can take that to the bank . It 's a cheap knock off .	-1
Not the name brand as advertised but a cheap knock-off . For the price , I guess it 's what I should have expected but am disappointed that Amazon lets them advertise as an original when it 's not . To inexpensive to bother returning and it is kind of handy so I 'll just use it until it breaks .	-1
More flimsy than expected . Tiny plastic dots that help keep the knife locked into place ( when in knife form , and not Credit card ) catch on wallet , no easy way to fix it . 80 % of this is plastic , and the knife is metal . It 's sharpness is negligible and ca n't even cut through cardboard . I 'm sure there are better folding knifes for the price .	-1
These bulbs flicker wildly in my light sensor night light , rendering the bulbs unusable . I tried them in a non-light sensor fixture , and there was no bulb flicker , but most ( if not all ) night lights these days have a light sensor.I just bought Philips bulbs this size from HD , and there is absolutely no flicker with my light sensor nightlights . These G7 Power bulbs , on the other hand , are unusable because they flicker like a strobe light . The Philips bulbs are a new model , with 3 CREE-looking LEDs , and are superior to these bulbs at the same price . My older Philips LED night light bulb ( with one blue-tinted LED ) also did not flicker , but was dim . The new Philips 3 LED bulbs are excellent , however .	-1
Installed each bulb of the two-pack on automatic night lights to replace blown out regular bulbs . These bulbs flicker on and off . Never had such a problem before with LEDs from the HomeDepot .	-1
I put this out for Christmas decor a week ago . I set it up on a timer for 5 hours of usage every evening . Last night it just went out . I brought it in the house but could not get it working again . Temperature has not dropped below freezing , no snow , but there has been ocassional rain . All the wires and connections look good . Is it possible it burned out after only 35 hours of use ? ? ? I will call the company and/or return to Amazon . The front of the house looked awesome . The light is extremely durable looking . I 'm very tempted to try another one . It was very expensive but saved so much work stringing lights and my neighbors all loved it .	-1
I purchased four of these for the holidays last summer . Just installed them and I was initially impressed with the display/output . Very cool effect ... ... ... ..BUT ... ... ... .CONS : The unit is very sturdy BUT the wiring is flimsy . I actually ran clear PVC tubing over the wiring to further protect it from the weather before installing . Note the wiring is bare-wire so you either have to purchase connectors ( I tried Malibu ) or cut the landscape cable and tape extensively to weatherproof . What I ended up doing.BIGGEST complaint is that light output using the four units is HIGHLY VARIABLE AND INCONSISTANT . SOME OF THE UNITS ( 2 OUT OF 4 ) ARE MUCH DIMMER THAN THE OTHER TWO . If , like I am doing , you mount two units to cover an area ( front of house ) you might have a problem getting consisitant light output ... ..one side dim ... .the other brighter.Now , the shell of the unit is sealed with a tag stating if you remove , let 's say to try and focus/center the lens ( as was my thought re : problem ) you void the warranty . At this price $ $ $ $ $ per unit , I 'm hesitant to open the casing and fool around ... ... So ... .I emailed Blisslights for reommendations on how to proceed.THEY HAVE YET TO REPSOND AFTER A WEEK ... ..totally unacceptable if they want reommendations and repeat business ! Suffice to say , I am going to use the two bright units in front and the two dim units on the side of the house . For nearly a grand invested , I would have hoped for a response from the Sellor.I 'll update after the holiday season if the Sellor responds , and also whether these units survive the season. Can not recommend at this time due to quality for the price and lack of Sellor communication .	-1
I have several Black & Decker powered screwdrivers . The flat one purchased several years ago was MUCH handier for me to use .	-1
I bought 2 of this MAXCRAFT 60196 39-LED Triangle Worklight and Emergency Light to keep in our 2 cars for emergency use . This product does not meet my expectations in most aspects.Issues : -- -- -- -First , the light is shipped without packaging . They came in the same box with other bulky stuff I ordered ( 3 lbs protein powder and other things ) , and no filler was used . When I opened the box both lights were ON . One in the red mode and one in the red flashing mode . The switches were obviously triggered multiple times due to the lack of packaging for the lights and the lack of filler in the box . The batteries on one were 80 % drained I would say ( dim light ) , and the batteries on the other were 95 % drained ( very dim light on red mode , and it wo n't even light up on worklight mode ) . Another reviewer faced the same issue and I 'm disappointed that Amazon did not address this ! Second , the batteries used are mix & match ( check the photo I uploaded ) . I had two different battery brands in the same light . This is totally unacceptable . I bought these lights with a description that says `` Batteries Included '' , and not only I receive drained batteries , but even worse someone decided not to do his job right by using different battery brands in the same light ! The Good : -- -- -- -- -- The light feels solid and well built.- After replacing the batteries ( which requires removing 2 screws ) , the lights worked as described . The same switch toggles between the 3 modes : red , white worklight , flashing red ( in order ) .- The magnet mount on the back is very useful.- The fold-away hanging hook is also great and is flexible to allow different mounting possibilities.The Bad : -- -- -- -- - The light output is lower than what I expected in all modes.- I really ca n't find a good application for the red mode . Others might though.- The red flashing is supposed to be used in case of emergency or to attract attention . It would work well on a bicycle for example , but it is dimmer than the average turn signal / hazard lights on a car . I 'm not sure this will be suitable for a roadside emergency as I intended to use it.- The `` worklight '' mode is closer to a flashlight than worklight . It throws a somewhat dim & narrow beam of white light , rather than lighting up a wider area the way a real worklight would . It is comparable to my Coast single-LED keychain flashlight that uses 1 AAA battery . It can still be used for many applications , but I was expecting more from 15 LEDs on 3 AAA batteries . It would still provide sufficient light to change a tire for example .	-1
It took weeks to arrive and did not fit the 501B flashlight I have.They were not the right thread or size for the 501B flashlight end where the switch screws into the female threaded base where you put in the AA battery . If you look at your flashlight , measure it and it is all the same as what you have , good luck . My flashlight , with the end switch screwed off is female and this switch is also female , only slightly larger . Did not work for me .	-1
It gets 2 stars because it works to a degree , read some of the other reviews . The deal is these are like the lights themselves . I bought 3 flashlights , the second one worked it also had an inspection & # 34 ; Passed & # 34 ; on the inside ( in battery compartment ) , the other two are usable to variant degrees.This thing will with a lot of pressure will turn light on , as long as you can hold it . had I got it at a dollar store , I would not be upset .	-1
This item is for some odd size flashlight . I have 15 and it was not even close to any of them . I was robbed .	-1
This simply is not worth the money or effort . Sure it might look cool on your AR or AK ( I would tend to disagree even on that ) but it is just too hard to operate . The switch is too finicky and I am lucky just to manage to get it to turn the flashlight on and off , much less strobe . After a few frustrating hours I just gave up and took it off and tossed in a drawer . It is much easier to just use the switch on the flashlight .	-1
Was not made clear in the item description that this flashlight requires a special battery , with a special charger , that you have to purchase separately . Plus , this type of battery is nearly impossible to find in a store . So you have to buy several and keep spares charged and on hand . What a hassle for a flashlight . I 'm used to slapping in some double AA 's and moving on with whatever I 'm doing , without spending a lot of time and effort on the process . Now I have to worry about my flashlight batteries , as well as & # 34 ; where did I put that special , expensive charger ? & # 34 ; It 's bright , but so are flashlights that run on double AA 's . Do not buy .	-1
Too bad . This should not happen but it happens . I dismantle it but so tiny electronic , impossible to see the problem .	-1
It takes an ambiguous battery type that MIGHT be CR123A but they call SR123 or something . Anyway , after no luck at the battery store and no light out of the device they can have it back . Other reviews mentioned getting different light spectrums from IR to just red to UV/Blacklight/Purple . Stay away .	-1
I did get mine today ( after more 13 days ) and I mounted it on a Yukon NVRS Tactical and the result is rather disappointing . I 'm getting bright haze through the scope because the IR is too close to the scope . If I hold the IR Flashlight in my hand and point it towards the spot I 'm aiming at , the result is good . But I was not planning on doing the FBI flashlight technique while hunting for critters .	-1
I purchased this with the intention of using it with a night vision monocular ( was n't sure the nm sensitivity , and for the price was n't too concerned ) . Received it , dropped in an 18650 battery , and turned it on , expecting to see nothing.Imagine my surprise when there was a very bright red circle on the ground . I 'm not talking `` If I look directly at it , it looks reddish '' , I 'm talking red batsignal.I 'll upload a picture that I took with my phone 's camera ( in visible light ) in case anyone doubts.Edit : Doing a bit of digging , it looks like I receivedthis flashlight instead	-1
picture fool me for uv lite	-1
I was very excited to obtain this for review as we actually have an additional 220 and 240 outlet in the garage and laundry room so thought this would be an easy install plus very needed item . Boy was I wrong . So , this arrived and it 's much smaller than anticipated ... not a bad thing per se because that makes it more manageable and easy to work with while putting out the same amount of heat . Here in Florida , we do n't have horrible weather but do have several nights below freezing where the concrete floors and walls of the garage make it rather miserable.So , right out of the box the first thing you will notice is the plug ... it 's not like any other plug I 've seen and certainly not the same plug used for my laundry room , garage or any other 220 or 240 volt . Fair enough , this is a 230 volt . So , I look up the instruction manual to determine the right plug to purchase for a retrofit ... and immediately see that the plug listed in the manual is NOT the plug on the unit . The plug in the manual is the same as that of my own units ... this one is n't that plug whatsoever . The picture does n't match . The plug does n't match anything . Okay , so the manual is n't going to help.I go down to the local hardware story lugging this little beauty in tow ... by now I 'm really glad it 's no bigger than it is ... only to find they do n't carry that plug and have n't actually seen one like it either . At this point I 'm getting a bit bent out of shape because apparently to purchase the right plug , I have to go to a specialty electric store which seems rather ridiculous for a product like this . Why put a specialty , hard to find plug on an item intended for the consumer market ? In fact , why make so much extra work and effort ... just use a standard plug ! Even worse , if you are going to use a non-standard plug , by all means , actually note that in your own instruction manual and remain consistent.I have the feeling that this ended up on Vine because of this exact type of inconsistency ... the wrong plug for this device/market/instruction manual . Not sure if others experienced the same but plan on adding about $ 35 plus the time to track down the right plug should you get a unit like mine then add in the time/money to retrofit a plug etc . Additionally , this plug is apparently NOT conforming to US devices . All in all , a completely unnecessary , time consuming and costly device . Stick with a ready-made version instead .	-1
Really does n't work very well . Motion sensor is not sensitive enough . Light is n't that bright , even to light a stairwell landing that has a light at the top and bottom already	-1
-- -- -- -- -- -- UPDATED 12/1/12 10:30 PM CST : -- -- -- -- -- -- Okay , I literally just finished writing this fairly glowing 4-star review ( also just got the bulbs today ) . I was walking out of the study after writing the review , and my wife had been waiting on me to use the computer.She says , `` Honey ! '' ( I thought she was going to chide me for being on the computer too long . ) `` One of your lights just blew . `` Me : `` What ? Not one of the new ones ! `` Her : `` Yes . How much did you pay for them ? `` ME : [ Silence . ] So there you have it . It kills me to remove my original review ( both because I like my other G7 bulbs and because I spent so much time on it ) , but I am returning these bulbs . I have good experiences with other model G7 bulbs , and I may choose one of those instead . Right now , I am going to put the old halogen lights back up in our 12-foot ceiling and go to bed . Argh !	-1
My wrenches kept falling out of this holder . I even tried wrapping the plastic & # 34 ; fingers & # 34 ; around the wrenches but they still did n't hold the wrenches so I returned the holder for a refund .	-1
The phillips screws in my HP laptop were tight , and started to strip the head of the largest of these screwdrivers ! Went out and bought a Craftsman set and no problem.You want real hardened steel for screwdrivers or they will fail and possibly do damage to the screws as well .	-1
Bought these to use in my new B & D hex head driver , but tried to use then for pilot holes with my new corded B & D driver . The 3/32 was so dull it could n't even drill in soft pine . The 5/32 broke off after trying to drill a pilot in a metal post . Save your money . Very inferior bits .	-1
these bits are very poorly made with cheap materials . when in my impact driver they wobble worse than a drunken sailor so i returned them and would not recommend . replaced with a set from dewalt that function as expected ...	-1
This is not an item that I recommend Amazon sell . Not up to your standards . Opened package from Amazon . A quick look a the drills through the clear packaging showed 3 crooked ones . I have thrown them away rather than risk injury . I DO NOT want anyone to purchase this drills .	-1
I had high hopes for these candles . Alas , they have a totally fake orange color . When will these manufacturers actually LOOK at a flame before designing a flameless candle ? Seriously , Flames Are Not Neon Orange.These candles look silly fake .	-1
BUT I have nothing yet to review -- Where is it ? Lost in transit ? Or maybe shipping procedures have been updated , because of the reveiws -- - and perhaps it is late getting to me because it will be shipped to me with more padding than the other unfortunate Vine reviewers were given . After all , this IS an ENERGIZER product and that `` bunny '' is one tough bunny -- so this LED Flameless Wax Glass Jar has alot of promise , coming from such a well-known company.UPDATE ! ! October 26 , 2012 OH NO ! ! ! It came in the mail -- shattered ! ! Dangerously so -- LITTLE tiny shards of glass like sand , all over the counter at the post office when I opened the mailing box . WHY WHY WHY ? ? ? ? When , with heavy bubble wrap and a sturdy box , this would have arrived unscathed ! ! Eveready you are losing so much money with this damaged merchandise , are n't you ? ? ? This product had great potential -- a calm flickering SAFE light , a nice spicy scent . JUST what I needed for Cee Cee 's room at night -- ESPECIALLY with the Timer function . Turn it on at night , know that it is off in the morning when the sun streams in and the room is no longer scary for Cee Cee.But no -- ANOTHER product destroyed even before the reviewer gtets a chance to enjoy it , use it and review it ! ! ! Oh , I am VERY disappointed ! ! ! !	-1
The candle was all smashed just like one i got last month.This is stupid.Dont people know how to pack glass items ? Someone just doesnt give a damn that all.I got frustrated because it was broken.cant review something thats broke into pieces .	-1
I like this LED candle , in theory . I like the flame simulation , I like that there is no danger of burning anything or dripping wax anywhere while it is in use . The scent is spicy and delightful and the color is pretty . I love the concept of presenting this as a covered jar candle . Unfortunately , the candle arrived in lots of glass shards ... and from reading other reviews , this is almost entirely the rule for this product.The box it arrived in was too big for the candle and contained only one sheet of air pillow wrap . But I do n't know if the glass is so thin that any amount of packaging would help . The opening on the bottom for the candle settings might just make this product unstable on the design end , never mind any problems with shipping.A few other issues : - The advertising wrap around the glass jar is distracting . As the Amazon product photo shows a nice , peaceful , unadorned candle , maybe the jar should not arrive with a big sticker around it.- Since the candle is made by Energizer , maybe for the price two AA batteries could have been included to start things off . Twentyish dollars is not cheap for a candle - not even for an LED one . It seems a bit cheap , when a battery company product arrives sans batteries.I thought I might still use what was left of the jar and hide the broken side and shattered bottom , but little shards fell onto my floor every time I picked the candle up . I had to remove the glass entirely to use this candle safely . I put the innards into a bell jar and it flickers nicely , but I should n't have had to do that.Even if the Energizer LED candle arrives intact for someone , I would still be extremely careful picking up and putting the jar down . I would handle the lid delicately too , since the glass sides are so very thin and fragile that even putting the lid on the jar sends cracks down the sides.Overall , I believe this candle needs some thoughtful tweaking in the design division of Energizer . The idea is very good , and I would have loved to use the product as intended .	-1
My candle arrived today , With the glass jar totally broken . The top of the jar was broken into two big pieces , and the jar itself into many little pieces.Though the candle smelled good , there was no way I could review the performance of this candle with timer -- -- because of the extremely poor packing ! The glass candle jar came in a cardboard box , with two pieces of bubble plastic on each side of it . That 's all . And , obviously , that was not enough to protect the product . Shards of glass in the box . Big , sharp , dangerous shards.So . A two star review . Two stars , because:1st star -- it SMELLED GOOD . ( Talking about the smell of the wax in the broken glass jar here . ) 2nd star -- the item seemed simple to operate . ( Battery compartment on bottom , clearly labeled . ) Minus three stars , because it was unusable .	-1
UPDATE OCT 18 : Tonight as I went to turn off the candle I noticed the candle base was cracked and losing pieces of glass . Fortunately the loose glass did not cut my fingers but a couple pieces of glass fell onto the floor . I have since swept up the loose glass before updating this review.Due to the glass breakage I do NOT recommend purchasing and using this candle . Lowered the rating to one star due to the glass breakage.UPDATE : The candle `` burned '' throughout the evening and watching the flame and the associated glow was very relaxing . While the candle did not produce a whole lot of light , the glow was warm and inviting.Also , the candle uses two AA batteries not four as listed in the Amazon description. -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -From a distance the Energizer Flameless Wax Glass Jar , Realistic Flame Pumpkin Orange and Spice Scent candle looks very much like a naturally burning candle . When the candle is viewed a bit closer , the tiny flame shaped bulb does not look all that realistic.The scent is nicely spiced and smells good . The outer candle wax looks like a real candle.Overall , the lit candle looks very nice on my fireplace mantle.Note : The candle came well wrapped in bubble wrapped . It was not broken and was in usable condition.Recommend .	-1
When I first saw it I thought it looked pretty cheesy but held out hope once `` lit '' it would be better . I 'm sorry to say that even lit it is ridiculous . One of those items you have to wonder how it ever got out on the market . There is a switch on the bottom with three positions . One is off but less obvious is the other two . One must be on and one must be timer but I do n't know which is which . With batteries ( not included ) installed there is a tiny light that barely glows . Certainly not enough to illuminate the container or come even close to replicating a real flame . There is also a scent that is not bad but not nice either . This thing is a huge disappointment .	-1
We have literally 20 or so electric candles it looks like a monastery from 7pm-midnight in our home.This one is supposed to be festive but-glitter falls off-light does n't shine through on the sides-no timer ( I 'm not sure if some other reviewers got a different one or not but this only has 1 switch on the bottom ) -expensive , I did n't pay over $ 9 for any of the others	-1
It does n't even really look like a candle on or off.The light is so weak , even at the high setting that it only penetrates ( and barely ) the top of the glitter.The light is so weak , that it is hard to tell that it is `` flickering '' .No batteries were included.There are so many better choices out there .	-1
I used this twice so far and it works fine . It is perfect for the holiday d & eacute ; cor and the lens has a warm glow during family dinner . The plus side is that it is safe around children , pets , no soot , and no smoke . It flickers very realistically and the Christmas red is perfect to set the mood for the holidays . The con side is , there is no real scent and I would rather burn a candle that produces nice scent rather than for pure ambiance.1.Gerson Company Everlasting Glow Flameless Ivory Wax Candles with Drip Effect , Set of 32.Gerson Company Flameless Ivory Pillar Candles with Remote Control , Set of 33.13 oz APPLE PIE CINNAMON VANILLA Scented Jar Candle ( Our Own Candle Company Brand ) Made in USA4.13oz FRENCH VANILLA Scented Jar Candle ( Our Own Candle Company Brand ) Made in USA - 100 hr burn time5.Yankee Candle Large 22-Ounce Jar Candle , Fresh Cut Roses6.13 oz HOT APPLE PIE Scented Jar Candle ( Our Own Candle Company Brand ) Made in USA - 100 hr burn time	-1
My wife loves candles . We have lots of them : real ones , fake ones , scented ones , unscented ones , chargeable ones , non-chargeable ones . On a scale of one to ten , this one 's about a two.. Here 's why : -- the glitter comes off and drops onto your pants or floor ... -- the flickering light ca n't be seen very well ... .ca n't be seen through the dark red exterior . Can barely be seen at eye level . Forget about putting it on your mantle. -- at $ 15 you can get at least two better ones.Some positives : It has a timer . We no longer buy candles or battery operated lights that do n't have timers . I hate going around the house turning these things on and off . The color is nice for Christmas and New Year 's holidays . The size is just right for say a dining table display . It does n't smell ... It 's safe to use ... I received this courtesy of Amazon Vine .	-1
Who designed this system ? It took several tries to get my lock registered , then the bridge said it failed , then it suddenly appeared on my account , then it said it was n't set up correctly , and I needed to remove it and go through the entire thing again ... And for what ? If you just look at the overall design of the app you can see it 's substandard . Nexia engineers needs to realize that when people are walking around with an iPhone in their pocket they expect easy to use , beautifully designed solutions -- and Nexia is not that . Even if everything was working perfectly , it does n't work with Best in Class products like Nest and Dropcam , so you 're starting off building a sub-par system . AND they 're charging us $ 10/month for the privilege ? What exactly are we paying for ?	-1
I am not using these for under a cabinet ( as indicated in the product name ) but rather in my garage and on the landing of some stairs . I previously had a motion light on the stairs which had an on/off switch and a photocell option so it would only function if it was both dark and sensed motion . I did not think the lack of the photocell feature would be such a big deal except the motion sensor is so sensitive , it sets off the light way more often than I would like . So far , the first set of batteries I have used in both are still going , although after a solid month of use , the light on the stair landing is starting to fade due to low batteries . I will try some rechargeable batteries next time , although I find light products tend to burn through rechargeable batteries quicker than regular batteries , even when brand new and fully charged . Overall , I am still pleased with the function of the lights and really like having one in my garage since the light switch is actually a few feet from the door inside the garage itself . Now I can see when I step into the garage without having to go to the light switch just to get something from the freezer.UPDATE : After using these for 3 weeks , I am back to update my review ( and dropping from 4 stars to 2 stars ) . One of the lights starting turning itself on every 10 seconds ( on for 20 seconds , off for 10 , back on for 20 ) . I even laid it down where the sensor could not trigger and it kept happening . The problem persisted even after putting in a fresh set of batteries . Given this turns the product into a 50 % failure rate , I have reduced my rating .	-1
One of the 4 units did n't come on reliably , even when I was waving my hand in front of it . Returned the whole thing .	-1
I was just pleased as punch initially with this product . Good light , came on quickly , went off as they should . After a couple of months , one of the three started going on and off erratically , then stopped working . I 'm guessing ( some of the other Mr. Beams lights I bought , another style , have done this ) that when the battery power gets to a certain point this is what happens . Not just dimmer light . It sort of freaks out ( for lack of better terminology ) .The other two followed suit . I contacted the company , they sent me some little plastic half moon thingeys to control the amount of motion getting to the sensors . They asked if the lights were in an area where they received constant nearby traffic that would trigger them . I said no . My kitchen is a dead end , and the fridge sort of blocks the movement from the dining room area . There was very little improvement , and the erratic on and off continued . I tried recharging the batteries , of course , to see if that helped . Batteries seemed to get drained more quickly the longer I had the units . I moved the two that still worked to the bathroom closets to see if being in an environment of little use would help . ( Hey , I ca n't return them at this point . ) One in the clothes closet is still functioning , the other came on last night and did the erratic thing . This is a `` Nice idea '' and works ( in my case and some others I read about ) for a while , but I bought batteries , chargers . . Good grief , all to avoid paying someone to put in some decent lights ! I can not recommend these to anyone for any reason . I think it is cheap throw away technology . I have taken them apart ( not too hard actually ) so I can recycle the plastic and the electronic boards and wires separately . If someone else 's lights are still working ( if they wrote their reviews within a month ) I would be very surprised . I tried EVERYTHING to keep these things and like them . Again , wonderful idea , but just cheap technology . I am going to have to learn not to be such a sucker for this type of gadget . The one I got for the outside ( larger gray round one with mounting base ) I just gave away , did not bother to return or even install . Not going to buy rechargeable D batteries and charger ! $ 25 down the drain on that one , too . Oh well , we all make our little purchasing mistakes .	-1
Contrary to the many popular reviews - I found this product to be seriously lacking in the quality control department . I used these lights under kitchen cabinets to illuminate two dark areas in the kitchen . The installation is very quick and the double sided tape that can be used ( rather than the screws that are provided ) was the ONLY redeemable quality . The tape is extremely sticky and will securely hold this product in place so be sure of your placement once you 're ready to install because you 'll probably NOT be able to switch placement once it 's in place.The down side ( and there were many ) - when the product was initially installed , I noticed that each of the lights would illuminate for differing times . There is a switch to have the lights illuminate for 20 seconds ( minimum setting ) or 60 seconds ( maximum setting ) . I switched both of mine to the max setting and neither would illuminate for 60 seconds when it would sense motion . It always illuminated for far less than 60 seconds therefore I 'd be working on the countertop and the lights were constantly flickering on and off at differing intervals . My lights were placed about 3 feet apart so I thought that when I 'm centered between the lights doing kitchen prep work , they 'd be sensing equal amounts of motion and stay on . Unfortunately , this did n't happen . I also noticed that one unit seemed to be much more sensitive than the other . Later ( and I 'm talking about 1-week ) , the unit that was LESS sensitive would n't turn off and it completely drained the batteries in very short order . Each light requires 4 AA batteries which gets rather expensive to operate if the batteries need changed once a week ( I was using Duracell Copper top batteries ) . According to the directions , the batteries will last around 40-hours therefore when a unit does n't shut off - it wo n't take long for the batteries to drain . Furthermore , when the batteries are being depleted , the light that is being emitted gets dimmer and dimmer so you eventually end up with a gray beam of light.I thought this was a great concept and was excited to give the product a whirl however after replacing the batteries in both units in less than 10-days , I 've decided to relocate these lights to the garage area with instructions for my husband to use them ONLY with rechargeable batteries . Regardless of where you use these lights - rechargeable batteries are highly encouraged.This product simply was not what I was looking for in my kitchen so I 'm back to looking for wired under cabinet lighting .	-1
Originally I gave this item 4 stars , but both lights have stopped working after a few weeks.It will start saying on for a long time , when it is supposed to only stay on about 20 or 30 seconds . And when it does go off , it will stay off for 2 or 3 seconds then come back on again for another long time . The result is that it is on most of the time and will use up your batteries.P.S . Even the replacement products that were sent to me quit working . I DO NOT recommend this product . You will be sorry if you spend money on this product .	-1
While the light is very bright , the battery life is so short that you can not rely on this item . you will only get about five days of bright working light and that is with very few motion activations . I strongly recommend you do not buy this unless you wish to manually turn it on and off for use .	-1
Besides the point that it really was not a good spotlight , it died 6 months later , threw away instead of replacing battery.I had it pointing to my home address about five feet away and it hardly cast any light to see from the street.I just leave my porch light on .	-1
Just very poor light coming out will not cover anything , very short battery life , and it is not working after 6 months .	-1
gears are already stripped out after one job . got ta return it ! I expected more from a porter cable product for sure . very disappointing !	-1
I bought this Porter Cable tool to remove grout in one of my bathrooms prior to sale . Unfortunately , it just did n't work out.For cutting wood , drywall , and other softer materials , I imagine that the Porter Cable might be a good tool , but it 's bad at grout removal.I broke two of the grout blades within 20 minutes of using each . The grout blade quality was just really bad , and I had to go to a local store and buy a Dremel MM45-01 to finish the job . The Dremel worked great and it 's blades looked like new when the job was done , despite having done the majority of the work.The Porter cable PCE605K also got really hot after a few minutes of use , and would burn my hand through the leather gloves I was wearing if I did n't put it down every five or ten minutes . When the unit was hot , it was impossible to switch out the blades because of thermal expansion of parts in the quick-release system . And , finally , after it got really hot it threw dark-gray motor grease all over , making a huge mess.Dremel 's tool quick-release system is just as good as the Porter Cable . Also , the Dremel MM45-01 tool that I used did n't get as hot as the Porter Cable , so I could use it constantly , without stopping.However , it fell short in a couple of other ways.The Dremel MM45-01 clearly was n't as rugged as the PCE605K , and is made to be used without gloves . It had a shorter power cable too . Using the Dremel with gloves is more difficult because it 's power switch is shallow in the body and difficult to grip , and it 's power-dial is easy to mistakenly move . The Dremel 's vibrations are much more shallow than that of the Porter cable , which makes it less powerful for everything other than grout removal . Finally , the Dremel was more expensive and the sanding and non-grout tools it came with were of lesser quality than the Porter Cable.Note that you ca n't use Dremel Blades in the Porter Cable tool . It might be possible with the adapter kit , but it physically wo n't fit into the quick-release system mount.If you need to do grout work , I would not recommend Porter Cable unless they fix the overheating problems with their tool , and start making a higher quality blade that wo n't shatter.It 's a sad sad day when Dremel , a company better know for making tools for hobbyists and jewelers , beats out a tool from Porter Cable .	-1
The shaft is 1 1/2 inches or so behind the front of the tool . Therefore , if the blade is at a right angle to the saw body it is impossible to get up to a wall at right angles to your cut . This is because the `` tool less '' hinge is in the way . The depth gauge is good for cuts with the blade sticking out the front , but useless otherwise . Also , the tool less system requires large hands with great strength . I 'll take a hex wrench any day.I gave this tool one star . But , if you always use the tool with the blade sticking out the front and can use the depth gauge , this tool is probably 5 star . Many times , however , there is not enough clearance to use the saw this way . Also , I find that I get better control with the blade out the side .	-1
This light is listed as for power failures and for use as a flashlight . Much to our surprise and disappointment , the banks of LED 's do not come on when the power goes out . Only the flashlight does , giving a weak light that is directed upwards . Basically , a waste of money .	-1
OK , I 'll buy another one , but if this one fails I 'm going back on warranty.I do n't know if the goods are old or dated or below specification .	-1
This timer switch does NOT support simple single pole / single throw functionality ( one black / one white lead ) . This timer switch requires a separate common ( white ) to power the timer and uses a load ( blue ) for the service.For whatever reason Intermatic has redesigned all their in-wall digital timers to this baseline . This model was purchased ( and subsequently returned ) to replace two decade old models that failed . In one case it was possible to rewire the service as a plug receptacle and use a plug-in wall unit to control the load . The other service has been returned to its original state of a common wall switch.The previous replaceable back-up battery functionality was far superior this design 's [ Boeing ] attempt at LiON battery & # 34 ; cool-ness & # 34 ; .	-1
I have one of the new homes and it worked great for 20 days . Flawlessly I should say . That is the only thing I like about itThings that I do not like1 . The Display is n't lit making it hard to see ; install/ program2 . I had to specify the sunrise and sunset for it to work.. This has been listed as one of the issues in troubleshooting guide and it can be programmed to work automatically ( not the manual that came with the switch but the online version ) , if required- A hassleThe switch stopped working now and the issue is one of the first to be listed in the troubleshooting guide . The display went blank and the on/off buton does n't work . In short it is defective , and had to be dealt with by filling a warranty claim on Intermatic website . Their technical support hung up on me thrice before I heard a human voice , only to tell me that warranties are handled on the websiteLuckily , I have a return shipping label from Amazon , and it is going back today . Im switching it for the more expensive honeywell	-1
Burn MUCH hotter than HitLights LED Bulbs and disperse less light to the sides compared to most other LED Bulbs -- - especially Phillips . I ordered two Lighting Ever bulbs to test -- -but I wo n't be ordering this brand again . I will stick with HitLights and Phillips .	-1
This bulb gets super hot . I do n't expect LED 's to generate a lot of heat , yet this one is hotter than an incandescent bulb . Not sure if this particular bulb is defective , or the design is bad and inefficient at converting the power to light rather than energy . But two different wattage bulbs from this manufacturer had the same problem with excess heat . Do n't recommend at all .	-1
Company is a liar in every possible way . Look at the package : `` save 90 % electricity '' , now underneath `` replaces 75W '' ... okay even by doing simple math with these ( overrated ) numbers we can come to 84 % savings , not 90 % .Title says A60 - there is no such thing as A60.But the main concern is that such companies should be banned from here totally for doing such shady business . This bulb is nowhere close to 1200 Lumen , 760 Lumen tested . Not 1100 , not even 900 ; 7 6 0 Lumen.Among other BS they also claim `` GS ( Geprufte Sicherheit ) certified '' . After I requested to see this certificate , the company stopped answering my emails completely . Go figure.Buyer beware .	-1
The lamps are described as `` ultra bright , '' having an illumination angle of 120 and a color temperature of 5500-6000K . The lamps I received are definitely not ultra bright but rather on the dim side ( even when illuminating a glossy white surface ) , as would be expected from the less than 2W rating ; the beam angle is less than 120 ; and the color temperature of the light , which seems bluer than that of a standard daylight source of comparable output , was higher than the specs when measured with a Gossen Sixticolor meter .	-1
This came on a very slow boat from China , and when it at last arrived I tried it only to see it went flash once and after that was stone dead ( so much for quality control ) . So I took it apart and was not impressed with its parts or construction . A little power supply was on the plastic shell ... I touched the plastic with a lighter and sure enough it was made of flammable plastic that immediately flamed on dripping burning plastic on my work bench . A fireman at work is now using it as a `` buyer beware '' demo in his fire safety class . After seeing it burn It was suddenly clear why this item was so cheep and shipped directly from China with no testing ! ! ! If made of flameproof plastic this would be a safer item , as is it should not be sold next to name brand items that have been safety tested and have UL ratings ! ! ! ! ! !	-1
At $ 2.65 I thought I 'd give this bulb a try . It took 5 weeks to arrive . I thought it was DOA when I put it in a standard US 120VAC light socket and it did not light . Then I saw the box marked 220V 1W . The bulb works with 220VAC but it is definitely NOT a 120VAC bulb as described . The luminaire is described as `` ultra bright '' having 110 lumen , an illumination angle of 120 , and a color temperature of 5500-6000K . The 220VAC lamp I received is very dim . Not even close to 100 Lumen . I expected dim from an ~1W rating but a 5W incandescent puts out way more lumens than this bulb . I 'd guess the 220VAC bulb I received puts out ~10 lumen which is roughly the same as a single candle or about the same as a single standard , incandescent Christmas twinkle light bulb you find in a string of 'Italian Christmas lights ' . [ Again Note : I ordered a 120VAC bulb but received a 220VAC bulb . ] The beam angle is less than 120 ( closer to 90 ) plus the color temperature of the light is too blue and measured higher than the specifications with a meter - just above 6500K.Warning ! The 220VAC bulb I received gets very HOT ! The plastic case is NOT Flame Resistant . This bulb is a possible fire hazard . Use at your own risk !	-1
I was looking for a 3way dimmer and not for a multiple location dimmer for led lights . Since this one stated it would do that , I purchased it for that specific function.What it did not tell you was that you had to rewire your other three way switch in order for this to work . For me , the other switch box is a five gang box that had NO room for extra wires . That meant that I could not rewire the switch ( you need to remove two of the wires , joint them with a wire nut to a third jumper wire that you rewire to one of the two terminals you removed the other wires from ) since the additional wire nut and jumper wire made it too tight to put the switch back in the gang box.So , I can not tell you if it actually works or not since i could not fit it into my installation . For me though , it would have been nice if the company said up front that you need to rewire any other switches in your installation.If you have lots of room and do not mind rewiring other switches in your circuit , this might work for you . For me , there are other 3 way dimmers that work just fine with LED lights that I would recommend prior to this one .	-1
I ordered a pack of five , but I only needed three . The five pack was cheaper than the three so I figured I 'd just have two extra . As it turns out , ordering five still left me with exactly THREE usable converters ... The first one I screwed in caused a fuse to blow , but I should have made sure the lamp was in the & # 34 ; off & # 34 ; position before trying a new product in it first , so when this happened , I blamed it on myself even though I 've done similar things before with no issue ... . That particular converter is unusable now , because the silver bottom of the converter was burned when this happened . At least , I am unwilling to screw it back in with such damage and find out..The second and third ones went in , no problem , but the fourth one would not allow me to screw in the bulb at all . I thought it may have been the bulb , so I got another one . And I tried it again with ones that already fit in the other converters ... No luck . So I toss that one aside and I hold my breath on the final converter , and thankfully , the bulb fit inside . The three I have work fine , and it allows me to use my three headed lamp , so I 'm not totally dissatisfied ... But if I happen to need more , I will choose to order or purchase in person from a company I have experience with.I have not contacted the seller because the text on the packaging was not in English , and I do n't feel like making myself frustrated when I have what I need after all . I just chalk the other two up to being a minor loss and a lesson learned .	-1
Cheaply made , one of them did n't work . The only reason I 've given them two stars is that the fit sockets that the cardboard ones do n't fit . ( The cardboard ones do n't screw in deeply enough to engage the power terminal ) . I ended up just replacing the candelabra sockets in the fixture with standard medium-base sockets -- -a much better solution than an adapter .	-1
The product is cheaply made and half would not fit in the lamp sockets . Inexpensive but I would choose another brand . Vendor was fine .	-1
I was happy to get these in just 2 days but disappointed when it short circuited my wall outlet and blew a brand new 9w CFL . When I tried it in another outlet it ruined my nite light switch , so it 's not good for anything so it 's going back to Amazon . Avoid at all costs .	-1
I bought 2 of these for my kitchen . When I first installed them both seemed to work fine . But after a couple of days one of them was only lit half way . Normally I would not have known that one of the lights was bad since I have a cover on the light fixture . But one day when I took off the cover to clean it , I discovered one of the lights only lit up halfway . Anyway , returned to Amazon and will reorder another . I recommend anyone who bought this or is considering buying this understand that you should check on it periodically .	-1
I GUARANTEE you the factory DID NOT test this tool with the one measly stick of nails provided . The front & # 34 ; comb & # 34 ; had two guides that were to big to allow the nails to pass . Because of the hassle to send it back from where I live . I filed the two & # 34 ; teeth & # 34 ; down and now it works . They may have tested it with small nails but certainly not long ones . Cheap Chinese junk ! !	-1
not happy at all . dose not hold well at all . the switch jams on all of them and need to hit them to re less	-1
I have replaced all the lights in my house with LED bulbs over the last year . These were the last ones , the under cabinet 12v G4 lights . These are maybe 1/16 the brightness of a standard halogen bulb . Everyone one of them flickered non stop once installed . Just a horrible bulb , I would avoid these completely .	-1
This has been pointed out before , at full extension there is some serious flex in the middle - talking 1/4 to 1/2 inch . I 'm currently cutting 4 by 8 sheets of 1/2 inch plywood in half length wise . To work around the flex I started snapping a chalk line then laying out the guide the proper distance from the line to accommodate my circular saw . Once I have everything in place , I tack a couple of Brads behind the guide , double check my measurements and then cut.My circular saw is an old ( 18 years plus ) Black and Decker Quantum and it is big and bulky , compared to newer ones . Pretty sure it makes the flex worse . Might not be as bad with a jig saw .	-1
Design is faulty as the guide will flex even when clamped . Do n't understand why product is so highly rated . Wish I had returned mine but waited past the 30 day return window .	-1
I needed to cut 1/4 & # 34 ; off the edge of a closet door with my worm drive saw and followed the directions to the letter . When my saw got to the middle of the door , there was nearly a 1/4 & # 34 ; flex in the guide , making it unsuitable for what I needed . I am returning it to point of purchase immediately .	-1
First off , I bought this on `` yaB-E '' for $ 10 . Whenever I buy solar , instantly I open the battery pack and take out the battery which usually is a low milliamp Ni-cd battery and replace it with a 2000 or above milliamp NiMH battery . These batteries will not only last a whole lot longer , but they do n't retain any memory effect . With Ni-cd , one cloudy day can shorten your battery life to less than an hour . The 2000 milliamp NiMH battery should also still be good to go even after a rainy day without charging as it is a higher capacity battery.I give this item two stars because I went through two of them and they are very temperamental.Having to wiggle the cord sometimes to get the light to turn on . Also not much light , but okay for the old bathtub I converted into a pond.I hope the above info helps . Like I said , I replace just about all my solar products ' batteries in this manner and have had much better results .	-1
This product is terrible . It looks great , and would be perfect ... if it actually worked ! The day I received in , I took it out & immediately place it in the sun . We rarely get rain , so I knew it would be safe.Safe it was , functional it was never.Tried charging it for literally a week with zero overcast & scorching sun . Nothing works.If you want to spend your money wisely , you wo n't waste it on this product !	-1
It 's ok and it works , but not well . The light only shines a few hours on an all day charge and the light it gives is not strong . Probably for the same price you could find a better value in another product .	-1
What a bummer ! I 'm all excited that this cool light arrived and I could n't wait to set it up however once I opened up the contents I saw that this light was used , missing parts and my best guess is that it may have been a past return ? I wanted To do a exchange but Amazon could n't provide that option . The only option was to reorder it again	-1
I have several LED solar lights , this is weakest of all of them . It is hardly usable . Blinking modes are useless . I threw away the box so now I guess I have to find some use for it .	-1
lights are too dim for outdoors . i would not purchase any additional ones . however , if you just need a very soft light without much power , it is small and may work for you . i wanted to use it to light up some small plants that are in large pots in my garden but these produce a very weak and dim light .	-1
