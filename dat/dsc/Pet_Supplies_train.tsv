There are usually one or more of my cats watching TV and staying out of trouble when this DVD is playing . They seem to like the mice and birds the most and maybe go a little less stir crazy being inside all the time .	1
I bought the triliogy and have tested out all the DVDs . It appears that volume 2 is the most well received of the three and the one I would recommend . It 's funny to watch my cat watch it bc she looks behind the TV trying to find the birds . I turn this on sometimes when I 'm leaving the house , by the time I get home , she does n't seem to be paying attention anymore but figured she 'd at least enjoy the sounds .	1
My female kitty could care less about these videos-but she cares less about almost everything . My little male however digs these . He does n't go ape over them , but he really does watch them for a bit and it makes me feel better to throw them on when I have to go out to work and leave him .	1
My Rottie has food allergies to poultry , beef and dairy . I 've had a difficult time finding a toothpaste that does n't make him allergic and he enjoys the taste . This toothpaste is peanut flavor ( smells like black licorice ) . He loves the taste and does n't wiggle as much when I brush his teeth every night . The price is ok , but I do wish that the tube came in a larger size . Soooo , if your pup has allergies or does n't like his/her current toothpaste you might want to try this one .	1
My puppy loves this stuff ! His tail starts wagging as soon as I ask him if he 's ready to brush his teeth ! It is actually an enjoyable daily experience ! Definitely my & # 34 ; Go To & # 34 ; dog toothpaste .	1
My toy poodle loves this stuff and will let me & # 34 ; sort & # 34 ; of brush her teeth because of it . I was hoping it would help with her doggy breath and it does some . Interestingly ... it says & # 34 ; peanutbutter & # 34 ; but it does n't smell like peanutbutter .	1
Works great and dog does n't hate the taste . Gum health is important so just have to brush those pearly whites .	1
Yes , my Princess is enjoying the taste showing that She is getting best/top results .. She loves that and me too ... Strongly recommended , without regret ...	1
I bought this product to stop the problem we were having with our 6 month old puppy . We have 5 little dogs that are paper trained . The product smells horrible to me , enough to make my stomach turn . I mixed it with canned food and all but one dog really loved it . I forced myself to tolerate the smell and continued to feed it to them for a couple of weeks once a day . It has helped to stop the problem even though one dog would n't eat it . I have stopped it for about a week now and it still seems to be working . I have my fingers crossed because I really do n't want to smell it as I feed it anymore .	1
Tried a couple other products before this , but this the only one that has worked . I have two dogs and the second one started this habit and taught it to our first dog . So disgusting ! As suggested by others we doubled the dosage and so far ( about six months plus ) it 's been working I would say about 90 % of the time ( that we can tell ) .My husband and I work long hours so they are in our side yard ( about 15 x 45 ) for many hours by themselves with a door to the garage . Though we walk them in the morning and then check the side yard for any deposits before we leave for work , before using this product , it was not uncommon for us to come home to dogs with horrible breath and a side yard of half-eaten piles . We also had a dog walker come 2-3 times a week in the middle of the day to walk them again ( and pick up any piles ) to alleviate this problem . However , we still ecountered this problem rather frequently . The poor dogs really suffered for it too because we did n't want them anywhere near us at night because they smelled so disgusting.With this product , we believe that the habit has stopped , if not all the way , at least to a significant degree . Other than I think twice in the last six months , we now come home to dogs that do n't gross us out with their bad breath anymore . And everyone is much happier for it.One more thing : Our first dog was starting to get finicky with his food . I do n't know if this powder was to blame or if it 's a supplement that we also give to him . But what I found out works really well are those liver biscotti sprinkles . Just adding a bit of those to the top of his dry dog food really helps with his finishing his food . ( The second dog is a food inhaler so she 's got no problem with anything we give her or add to her food . )	1
Works really well -- not 100 % of the time , but most of the time . I spend much of my time outdoors picking up dog poop from my 2 dogs , so I can tell this is really working . I liked it so well , I bought a replacement when the first jar ran out . Would recommend .	1
This product works very well , it one used this very consistently . I have four dogs and just one of the dogs has this habit .	1
Very Happy with this bird food holder ... Heath Manufacturing S-1-8 Single Hanging Suet Feeder ... 4.98 each I bought two ... I of course bout the special square bird food also ... I 'm new at this and am having a blast ... what a cool way to feed birds and a great addition to my bird feeder !	1
This Suet hanger is easy to open and easy to hang.it makes a great addition to my bird feeders . The green color blends with nature .	1
Birds seem to use these with the citrus suet blocks more then my feeders . Of course this is winter and possibly the birds need the fat more . Economical and bird 's favorite what more could I want !	1
We 've owned a whole set of these for our dogs and cats ; they 've never broken , warped , or discolored in all the years we 've had them . They stack great in pantries and feature a space for locks if you have an animal that may try to help themselves . They 've survived beach trips , time outdoors , and one really naughty standard poodle pulling a full one to the floor . We 've also used one to store extra cat litter and another wild bird seed.Their only bad feature is they are not air or water tight ; they will keep food fresh for sure but not like an unopened bag . I 'd recommend you be able to use any food in them within a month or two . If you have a dog with allergies to storage mites you will want to either wash these bins between bags or choose a bin that is air tight .	1
Loved the way I could stack the bins since I have two dogs that eat different kinds of dog food . Only problem is my 18 month old Soft Coated Wheaten Terrier can some how open the door . Not Good	1
It keeps inside of closets . It is very easy to handle with it . It is perfect size to put in the closets . Nice shape	1
The trouble with Glucosamine/Chondroitin supplements is that some of them work and some of them do n't . And sometimes a brand that has worked stops working . So far CosaminDS works . I hope the manufacturer does n't try to increase their profit by reducing the active ingredients . So far it 's the most effective Glucosamine/Chondroitin I 've tried.Edit : They work better than any other supplement I have tried . But best to order them in the cool months , so they do n't spend the several days in above 100degrees .	1
Cosamin DS Joint Health Supplement is far superior to any other supplements of this nature that I have tried . My doctor recommended it highly , and I have been on it for a couple of years , and can really tell a difference !	1
the seller is excellentThe price is very goodQuailty was NEW sealed in bottleWill use the seller againThe product is very good and reccomended by my doctor	1
My dogs veterinarian recommended that I try this product a few years ago . I have been taking it ever since.I have had surgery twice on one knee and I had a lot of pain . It took many months before I felt any difference at all , but eventually I noticed my knee was not hurting ! What a relief ! Now I can walk a few miles with no pain at all . If I do get a little selling or stiff , I ice for 15 minutes , and just put on a salonpas patch and I am fine in 10 minutes . Happy days ... If my review helped you , can you please take a moment and click on the `` helpful '' button ? Thanks ! : )	1
I have been using these supplements for a few years , with them my joints are somewhat tolerable but without them my joints are impossible . For me , they are a requirement so that I can function day-to-day .	1
Have bad knees . Had one knee replacement -- do n't want another . Am trying this . Does seem to mae the other knee feel btter but have only been taking for 6 months .	1
This is the same product , same mgf . , that vets give to large dogs , but cost less in the human form . My vet recommended these and they are great ...	1
As a foster furmomma for a cat rescue and a cat slave to my own cats , this prodcut is a dream come true and has been saving my life for 10 years now ! Worth every penny you pay ( if you avoid the high retail ) and worth the time it saves . Yes , they do break down , what does n't ? But with a little care and obvious common sense these work for YEARS ! You do have to break them down a few times a year for a good cleaning and keep the track the rake rides in halfway clean , but otherwise still the best thing . I will never be without them or without a spare in the closet just in case ! One suggestion is that the manufacturer scale back the side panels of the receptacle lid so that these can function in a smaller space when the rake hit it , such as in a closet without hitting the doors . I have 4 of these units in a closet , two on the floor and two on a shelf a little higher and have them side by side . I broke one when the lid sides pushed against the back inside of the closet door when raking to the receptacle because someone had shut the closet dorr partially . So making those `` flaps '' shorter would greatly reduce the actual amount of space the units need to take up functionally .	1
I gave 5 stars because i 've had three Litter Maids over about 12-13 years and have always been very grateful not to have to clean the catbox -- i was able to forget about it for at least a couple of weeks at a time , sometimes much more . I have only one small cat . You ca n't beat not having to think about the catbox , it 's almost like not having one at all -- compared to the old fashion litter box.I first saw the Litter Maid in the LA Times Magazine around 1995 , there was a full page ad , and you could pay in three installments , it was expensive , at least a couple hundred . Catbox scooping depressed me so i ordered one . Mine worked right out of the box.it 's always tricky putting the right amount of litter in . If i put too much , it just keeps recycling and raking until i take some out . Following the instructions , i found that there would be too much litter and the machine would malfunction , but if i put it lower than the limit line , it would be fine.I had some kind of technical problem in the beginning , i ca n't remember what , and was pleased with their tech support , they took care of me , way back then.After a few years , it stopped working and i gladly got another one . At some point , i began using Litter Pearls cat litter in it when that first came out . That was yet another technical advance for my situation . The Litter Pearls absorbed the urine so there was less stuff getting scooped into the box , and i was able to go even longer without being reminded of the litter box.In the beginning , Litter Pearls was just regular little round pearls . Then , my pet store came out with `` lite tracking litter pearls '' which were not round . They made them irregular shaped and rough , to prevent tracking i guess . That new light tracking style did not agree with my Litter Maid . It was too granular and it jammed up the mechanism . My pet store stopped carrying the regular non-lite tracking kind of Litter Pearls , so i had to search for an alternative.The combination of those little round litter balls and the Litter Maid did great things for my quality of life . I did not want to go backwards into using the old fashioned kind of litter . I was ready to buy the regular Litter Pearls from the company in another state , ( i called around ) if necessary , or on eBay , but i was able to find another brand that had the round balls in a local store , the brand is Litter Secret , i could n't find the product on the web though.As long as i had the little round ball litter , not the lite tracking kind , my Litter Maid performed consistently . The second one lasted several more years with never a mechanical problem . Long ago , i got the tent . I would always use a tent with the Litter Maid . For me , the less evidence of a litter box the better.The Litter Maid rake did not clean easily and with my policy of not paying a lot of attention to the litter box , eventually the second Litter Maid got messy and the price had come way down on them , so i decided rather than clean it , i 'd just get a new one . the motor was still working fine , there was no problem with it after several years . I just did n't feel like cleaning it , was working lots of overtime and my job and felt i could afford a new one . I 've had the third one for several more years , it has been very low maintenance , no mechanical problems , i just have cleaned it every few weeks , i 'm not sure how often , maybe 2 weeks , maybe more , it seems long between times when i have to deal with it.Recently it stopped working . The light was on but without warning , it would n't become active , it just sat there.I got a Litter Robot to replace it , because of the great reviews and decided i would try a change , since LItter Robot will let you return it for 60 days . I 'm still evaluating the Litter Robot , but there are some things that so far , i like better about the Litter Maid , one is , i didnt ' have to regularly clean the Litter Maid , just take out the plastic containers , and then do a big cleaning once in a great while . I think i 'm going to have to clean the Litter Robot more often.The Litter Maid plastic containers were easier for me to switch out and replace than the plastic bags for the Litter Robot , less struggle , less time spent bending over the `` dreaded area . '' And more secure feeling because stiff plastic is thicker than a plastic bag.Being inside the tent , the LItter Maid did n't have anything directly exposed to open air , whereas the Robot sits there with its door open and litter sitting out there in contact with the rest of the world . Having said all of that , the LItter Robot is very cool . More ingenious than the LItter Maid . anyone could dream up the LItter Maid . It would take a special kind of mind to think up the Litter Robot . Watching it do its thing is something to behold , in terms of human engineering . I was very happy with the LItter Maid , my three worked reliably and flawlessly each one for many years . I did n't have to deal with tech support . But again , i had only one small cat.Oh , i almost forgot . My cat always liked to use only one side of the Litter Maid , so the waste would pile up on one end of the plastic container , causing it to fill up faster , only on that side , than it would if it had been distributed evenly . When it fills up and does n't close completely , that 's when i can smell it and i go into action to change the container , but i alway would find that half the container was n't used , it was empty on one side , full on the other . This never affected the mechanical performance of the Litter Maid itself.Update : 10/3/10I have just retired my most recent Litter Maid which i started using a year ago . I was having a very hard time with it . It worked well as far as the motor and everything it 's supposed to do , but the problem was with the litter ( crystals ) . The crystals were getting saturated in only about 4 days and if i did n't change the litter , my cat would pee on the floor cover that i kept under the litter maid . That is way too frequent to have to deal with cat sewage , by my standards . Urine was getting all over the box and under the box . I thought the litter maid was leaking but could n't find any openings . It took me a long time to figure out that my cat 's hyperthyroid condition was causing her to excessively urinate . When i realized it , about two months ago , i doubled her medication and the problem has gone away . but she continued to refuse to use the Litter Maid , i think it must 've developed an odor because of all the urine all over it , i tried to wipe it off but far from perfectly i 'm sure . Even though the crystals were n't saturated at all , she was peeing on the floor cover . So i have just replaced the Litter Maid with a ScoopFree automatic box . So far it 's working great . I took the Litter Maid outside , cleaned it as best i could with diluted Simple Green spray , it looks ok , i put it some big plastic bags and will keep it in the garage . It has been working very well . A real trooper.I want to say that i appreciate the Litter Maid , it served me well for about 16 or more years , about 5 of them over those years , two were thrown out not because they wore out but because they were dirty so in my experience they have worked well . I never had a problem with the motors , and i was always impressed at the way it just kept raking over and over , never giving out.This is different from some peoples ' experience . I want say that i have always used Litter Pearls crystals in the litter Maid , not clay or clumping litter , and that may be why i have n't had the same problems some have had . I would recommend using crystal litter with it , but in my experience , it had to be the rounded kind , not the trackless/lite tracking kind which are irregularly shaped . The trackless kind were too abrasive and jagged for the litter maid , they jammed it up , causing the rake to come to a painful creaking halt in mid cycle . But the rounded ones work well , they just are n't easy to find because people tend to prefer lite tracking litter . But other than that , the crystals have always worked great in the Litter Maid .	1
I am very happy with how long this product lasted . Mine is a little over 8 years old , and it just broke the other day . While i will admit the bins are kind of expensive and it is noisy ... It lasted for 8 years without any user error related issues ! 7 of those years it was used by 2 cats , now just one.I am very happy with the product , and have every intention of replacing it !	1
I have had littermaids for about 10 years . In those 10 years , I have had two of them in which they work awesome . I have 4 cats , and its awesome just having to dump the plastic waste holder out every day , or every other day and not have to worry about litter all over the place and scooping . I have my current unit in a closet , and with 4 cats it has worked great for the last two years ! ! Once the plastic lid and waste holder get a little worn , litter can fall between the crack which can be a pain , but I try to open the waste door carefully and pull the waste holder out gently to ensure the waste holders last a while before I have to replace ... When this unit wears out , I will move up to the Elite , which is bigger . But going strong on two years , hopefully it will keep working hard !	1
My previous Littermaid box was over 4 years old and finally quit ( it 's used by 2 cats daily ) . After checking reviews on the newer Littermaid models , I decided to stay with the LM500 and I do n't regret it . The litter box size is a little smaller than the old box , but it works great ( my cats each weigh about 7-3/4 lbs , they 're small cats , so the size difference was n't a major problem ) . I have no regrets getting this model again . Sometimes I have to scrape the kitty goo from the bottom of the box where it seeps and coagulates , but I had to do that with the old box too . When you change and clean the litter box section , wipe some baby oil on the bottom of the pan before you add new litter , it helps to lift the coagulated kitty goo more easily .	1
i 'm a cat lover of the first order , and presently own4 Himalayan Seal Points.this product is a dream come true.with a little care and common sense , it does everything they say it does.after years of digging and scratching around in litterboxes myself , it 's a joy to own something that brings the process into the 21st Century.some thoughts : use the premium litters they recommend . anything else , and you'llbe cleaning the rake and scraping the bottom of the tray more often than would be necessary.spray the bottom of the tray with silicone from time to time.it makes the operation much smoother.do n't overfill it . the cats will naturally form mounds in the litter , in the process of trying to & quot ; bury & quot ; their waste , so smooth the litter around in the tray now and then , to keep it even.keep the unit set on a piece of old carpet , and keep a hand-vac nearby . small granules make litter tracking a little more of an issue.forget about the tent.if you like to keep the box as clean as your cats probably like to have it , the tent makes the box impossible to get to , and work around in.the disposable trays are very handy . they 're stiff plastic . line them with a small garbage bag , or wash them out and reuse them . throwing them out every time is an expensive proposition.keep your supply of litter next to the box . ( i store it in one ofthose plastic stackable bins . ) as the volume of litter is reducedjust add more as needed . you 'll be dumping the whole tray a lot less often.with 4 cats , i clean the entire unit about once every two weeks.i use a lot less litter , and spend almost no time dealing with the waste itself.any issue with smell is easily dealt with by sprinkling a littlebaking soda in the waste receptcle from time to time.all in all it 's a very fine product , that makes caring for yourpets much more efficient .	1
My downstairs neighbor bought one of these for her cat , Zipper , about eight months ago . My tortoise shell , Lotta , who stays downstairs daytimes while I 'm gone , fell in love with it , so I bought one for her birthday four months ago.I 've read through the reviews and the unhappy experiences several people have had with it , but neighbor Shirley and myself have had no trouble at all with our units . The cleaning is n't at all that difficult ( does help to follow printed instructions ... taking the thing apart as one person apparantly did is n't necessary ) . The waste receptacles should n't need replacement more often than once every month or so . And while the unit does make some noise , neither of us have found it excessive or particularly annoying.As noted , the above is based upon my experience with my littermaid as well as neighbor Shirley 's experience with hers . Each of us agree that it sure beats the heck out of scooping the litter out every day . Also , we have noticed that less litter is required ... probably because the unit operates about 10 minutes after use , before the urine soaks up a lot of the litter .	1
I 'd like to note that the review I wrote below , I will not change , but I have this to add : The thing needs semi regular cleaning . I mean cleaning completely , with a new coat of scotch-guard on the pan surface and fresh litter refilled.And that may not make a difference if you have a cat that aims for the plastic tines . And cleaning those is kinda nasty . I 've noticed that a new version is out with metal tines . Maybe the manufacturer 's cat had good aim too.Since writing the review below we got a cat with exceptional aim . He could jam up that thing in one session . We were cleaning it every day , and finally opted this year to get a plain old deep rectangular litter pan with scoopable litter and ditch the Litter Maid . Heck - we were in cleaning it everyday anyway due to our 'artistic ' new cat. -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -I have three cats , all indoor , and you can imagine I 've tried about every kind of litter to come up with something workable for both me and the cats.I 've had a LitterMate ( the larger size ) for almost a year now and think this is the next best thing to sliced bread . we liked it so well , we 've recently gotten the regular sized one as well since the cats were giving the one we had such a workout.Pros : Our dogs no longer go litter-diving for 'snacks ' . The mechanism scares them and most of the contents are now hidden away in the plastic container.The cats are only fascinated by the workings of the litterbox and had no problem adjusting . The oldest was 6 , the youngest 5 months.Scoopable litter + three cats previously meant 2-3 times a day scooping the litterbox . One LitterMate + three cats = 2-3 times a week tray dumping . The trays are easily reused , making them more economical.The box itself has been dumped and cleaned every other month . The comb is held in place by two screws and is easily removed from the engine to be cleaned . I soak the bottom pan and comb in an antibacterial cleaner solution , and after it 's dry use Scotchguard on both.The house I live in is small - there are few places to hide litterbox odor . This does it effectively.One of our cats like to dig his way to China when he covers his stuff . I was worried that the scratches on the bottom of the pan would cause more sticking than normal , but a generous coating of Scotchguard keeps things moving along in spite of the battle scars in the LitterMaid.Cons : Yes - litter does escape underneath a little , but with the activities of three cats we were always vaccuming around the litter box anyway - no difference there.The litter flinging problem happened once to me - every time afterwards I threw the garbage bag on top of the tray while I removed it , then just tipped it into the bag . Again , no biggie.Tips : Those lines in the litterbox are n't kidding - do n't fill the box over the red line , or the motor will jam.When they say Premium clumping litter , they mean it . The alternative is a constantly jammed motor.Whenever you empty the tray , pass the scraper through the pan to make sure that nothing escaped the comb along the bottom . Those spots can build up and cause a jam too.If stuff sticks too often to the comb or bottom , it usually means it 's time to dumb the entire box and clean and re-coat it with nonsitck spray . Not the non-stick spray used in cooking either .	1
I bought the largest LitterMaid off of Ebay in Jan 2003 from a Seller called KittenKaboodle . It took a few trials to find a litter that worked well but I settled on Scoop Away . Yes , as some reviewers have mentioned , sometimes it does stick to the bottom and you will have to use the scooper to scrape it up or clean the rakes sometimes . Then , I just turn it on and off and it will rake everything up . It only takes me a few seconds to check for any stuck spots or even out the litter , turn it on and off to make it rake and then add a little new litter to the top ( so the cats think it 's nice and clean ) . : - ) It 's not completely `` no work '' but it is a lot less work than a `` manual '' litterbox and stays smelling cleaner than manual boxes . I do use larger plastic grocery bags in the receptacle . It 's a lot cheaper than throwing away receptacles every 3-4 days and it 's alot easier to clean . Believe me , I do not like trying to pry those receptacles out when it is completely full . You have to stick your fingers inside to grab onto it ( YUCK ! ) and it 's heavy and hard to get out sometimes dumping litter and stuff all over the place ( double YUCK ) .The Seller on Ebay was selling the one I bought with a `` super charged '' motor ( which is in the electrical cord ) . It worked pretty good for almost a year . Apparently , unlike the `` normal motor '' , the stronger motor kept it from resetting sometimes when it would hit clumps that were too big for it . It would attempt to plow right thru which sounds like a good thing , but it was n't . Apparently the gears and/or sprokets which move the rake along are made of plastic and within a year they were stripped . It started out making a spinning sound once in awhile but would eventually go ahead and rake . One day I came home to a god awful sound . I found the rake stuck right in the middle of the box , gears just spinning and making a heck of a racket . This was enough to scare away ALL 4 cats from the ONLY litterbox . Needless to say we had some accidents . 3 of my cats `` recovered '' and would go back to the disconnected box , but my 20 year old cat was traumatized and refused to use it . So I had to set up the manual box . I 'm STILL working with her trying to get her to stop going elsewhere because of this.I took the Littermaid to a repair shop and they knew immediately that the gears were stripped because they 'd seen it before . They said they could n't repair it because they could n't get parts.I contacted the Ebay Seller who said it was still under warranty . I had to pay shipping to and from the Seller though which was not cheap . The 2nd supercharged Littermaid started doing the same thing after less than 6 months and the Seller says this one is not under warranty . Apparently , the warranty does not extend to the replacement that they sent me which I think is a rip-off considering how expensive these things are.While the 1st Littermaid was being repaired , I went ahead and bought another `` regular '' ( not supercharged ) Littermaid from Petsmart . I 've had it 8 months and had no skipping problems so far . I think the `` supercharged '' motor caused all my problems , but KittenKaboodle refuses to acknowledge this and refused to warranty the 2nd box that they sent me.So , overall it 's great when it works , but it could use a few improvements . The bottom of the pan needs to be made of something more `` non-stick '' so the rake can get thru some of the larger wet spots and/or the gears need to be made of something stronger to be able to take a stronger motor that can get thru the stuck on clumps ( and not strip the gears ) . Also I would like to see a slightly larger receptacle on the larger models . They are made for a multi cat household but with only one litterbox it fills up pretty fast . With 2 litterboxes it 's not too bad though . I would also like to see some sort of hood like other auto litterboxes that I 've seen . That tent seems like a nuisance ( it looks like it would block the on/off switch and collect litter in the box . )	1
with so many different automated litterboxes on the market , i just chose this one based on the fact it 's one of the newer ones , and littermaid is a more recognized brand . i have 3 cats that go A LOT . so it 's important for me to get a litterbox that 's minimal maintanence.1 ) the set-up is really easy . i for one do n't read directions , and it was simple enough.2 ) it was pretty much what it claims to do , rake up clumped litter.3 ) the biggest problem i have so far is that it does n't clean as well as i 'd like it to . little pieces of poop gets pass the rake , so i have to hand-scoop those.4 ) minor problem is that the capacity does n't allow for you to use lotsa litter , since the rake can get stuck . so if you have cats that pees a lot ( like mine ) the litter can get used up really quick and you would have to refill almost daily . also the removable receptacle is really flimsy . so it 's kinda hard to reuse without breaking . forces you to buy refills.5 ) all in all , it does save me a little bit of time , and it is much cleaner and smells less than a conventional litterbox . i would recommend it if you have do n't mind spending 100 bucks . my cats seem to like it and find it amusing .	1
Frankly , this has taken WAY too long to invent ! Where was this 20 years ago ? ! ! Anyway , what a Godsend this thing is to our house . I use the multi-cat formula litter in ours , even though we only have the single cat . It just keeps things smelling nicer longer and you do n't really have to worry about the mess . My only complaint with this thing is that sometimes it scoops litter onto the floor but hey , that 's what brooms are for ! We have ours in the basement so that really is n't much of a factor regarding the litter spillage . However , I do still keep out a regular box just because ours likes to do one in one box , and the other in another box . I 'm tempted to get two of these Littermaids just so I do n't have to worry about changing the other box ! Ours gets clumps on the rake as well when our boy likes to urinate on it , but I just use a regular cat scooper and scrape it off . Also , those refills are tremendously expensive so I do as the previous reviewer and just reuse them , fill them with a deodorizer ( baking soda works great and it 's cheap ! ) , and voila ! I 've not had any trouble with mine getting so full that I could n't get it out to empty . It snaps out pretty easily , even if there 's quite a load there in it.This is one of the best products I 've bought for a very long time and I 'm very happy and glad that it 's around . My aunt has had two of these things for about 7 years , if that gives you any idea of how wonderful they are to have around . Great product .	1
We have two of the Littermaid Mega LM900 litter boxes , and would buy another one . They work reasonably well , and save a lot of scooping time & effort . As other reviewers have noted , it works OK , but not perfect . Help is needed at times , but it 's still a big benefit to have . The rakes need to be cleaned periodically , since the clumps are not fully dried after 10 minutes . And the litter needs to be redistributed away from the collection box several times each week as a result of the rakes getting filled with wet clumps . Our cats used it almost immediately after it was set up , and still seem to enjoy watching it operate.We have had one unit for about 18 months , and added a second recently . Both work equally well . We use plastic grocery bags in the collection box , which is easier than using the plastic boxes . You may wish to add a timer to turn it off over-night , so it does n't wake you .	1
I have now purchased a total of 4 of these . It seems that after 4-5 years the motors finally give out . - However , that is 4-5 years of it sweeping the litter clean multiple times every day.I have three cats and I always have 2 of these boxes in use . Primarily I bought them after I adopted a rescue kitten - who as it turned out , has the coronavirus that can cause Feline Infectious Peritonitis ( FIP ) . Some apparently healthy cats may carry the virus which can be shed intermittently in bodily fluids or feces , with feces being the most common source of oral infection.She is completely healthy by all other standards - but if she or the other two catch a cold , or feel stressed etc. , this coronavirus can surface . Much like a herpes virus in humans . And like the herpes virus it is easily transmitted . With cats the primary method that they transmit illness to each other is through feces.With the LitterMaid automatic box - the potential for all the cats to step on or otherwise put a nose to each other 's waste is almost completely eliminated . ( with 2 boxes - I have never seen one cat go into a box right after a cat has used it . - They go to the other one , which is clean and ready for their use ) And because I can work some very long hours . 16-18 hrs some days . I feel a bit more assured knowing the box is keeping itself clean.It does take a bit to get used to as far as the noise of the rake and what it takes to do a through clean . But , as I like them so much for what they do that I do n't mind the maintenance . Which is n't as involved as it would seem . It 's actually rather simple to clean with a wet handrag and the occasional vacuum or dustbuster ( which can be said of almost all litter boxes ) Another advantage -- you do n't need much litter and it goes much further.You do need to use a premium letter ( I use 'the World 's Best Litter ' ) - but because it lasts as long as it does , it is a financial bargain .	1
I 've used these for about ten years and I keep a spare on hand because it is just a machine and it will eventually wear out , although I 've never had one fail . The receptacles are expensive and difficult to clean , but there 's a way to keep things clean and a receptacle can last a year or more . Just purchase a box or roll of 3 or 4 Quart trash bags . Try both to see which suits you best . Then simply put the bag in the receptacle , fold the sides and ends down and put the receptacle in the machine . When the receptacle is full just take out the receptacle , remove the bag with its contents , tie the top in a knot to contain the odor , and put it in the trash . The receptacle remains perfectly clean and can be used until it falls apart . This method has probably saved me many hundreds of dollars over the years and takes all the mess and cleaning out of the process .	1
In a household with three adult cats I was constantly cleaning the litter box . With the Littermaid LM900 I need only empty or replace the waste container about twice a week . The litter is kept clean and smoothed by the automatic raking action . Odors are minimal since waste is stored in a closed container and the exposed litter is continually cleaned . Make sure you only use premium , clumping litter . That 's the good news.Now for the not so good news . The unit is noisy with a capital `` N '' . Do n't plan on placing it near the living spaces in your home if you value your peace and quiet . Waste frequently lodges between the teeth on the rake so I 'm finding myself visually checking anytime I 'm near the unit and using my scoop to clear the rake . About every other day I need to use the scoop to scrape along the bottom of the pan to loosen anything sticking to the bottom so the rake can catch it on the next pass . Lastly , the included ramp which is supposed to keep your cat from tracking litter is a joke . It simply is n't big enough and my cats usually jump over it rather than walk down it . To solve the problem , I continue to leave a small area rug in front of the unit . That seems to catch about 75 % of the tracked litter . the unit is n't cheap . Taking into account the noise and the other problems , I would still buy the unit if I had to do it over again primarily for the conveninence .	1
This is my second Littermaid . My first worked great but my cat died so I sold it on Ebay . However , it always worked well but you have to use the correct litter or the Littermaid will not work as advertised . I never had a problem with the motor failing or other issues I 've read in these reviews . I also read that if the motor jams there is a reset that many user may not know about and this may be a reason for so many returns . Once again in the year I used it the motor never stopped working . The box is a bit noisy so I would n't suggest setting this in a bedroom . Also , there is a chance that the rake moving and noise may scare your cat and they will not want to use it . Try setting it up with the power off for a few days and then turn it on after the cat gets use to using the box . The only other issue is that there is a raking motion that pushes all the waste forward but it also pushes good litter with it so the end result is good litter gets dumped into the plastic bin . I had the option of buying the newer unit but read so many bad reviews that I decided to go for one of the older models . I also build a table with a hole in it . Then I cut out the bottom of the plastic container that catches the waste . Now the unit dumps the waste into a 13 gallon trash bag and I can go quite a while without emptying it . With the stock container you can go about 3 days with one cat . If I was n't setting up the table and larger bag I would look more closely at the Smart Scoop . It seems to waste less litter .	1
I purchased this same Littermaid 3 years ago and it is still going strong . We have 3 littermaids , all different models for our 3 cats . I could not possible keep up with cleaning the litter and this sure helps me out a lot . We bought the permanent chute from Litterworks and my husband used an old entertainment center we got for next to nothing at goodwill and it fits 2 littermaids comfortably . If you look at littermaid disposal system at amazon [ ... ] you will see what it sort of looks like . I love the LM9000 but I would agree the LME9000 ( elite with the ionic air cleaner ) does not work well and it gives littermaid a bad name . If you can find the basic ones I think they work better than the ionic air cleaner ones . We only empty our litter a couple of times a weeks as once it goes down the chute into the trash bag we only have to take the trash bag out . No , it does not smell , I also add a little baking soda to the trash bag but you do have to clean the littermaid occasionally just like any other litterbox , just not as much . I use Worlds Best Litter ( corn litter ) makes littermaid work easier and cuts down on the dust from litter . It is a shame that the elite 's have sullied the littermaid product name . I hope they improve on it as I would like to buy a backup in case one of mine goes ( I figure after 3 yrs it 's due ) but I wo n't buy another elite with the ionic ( read moronic ) air cleaner .	1
I have four of these and they are a great help . Some of my cats a are a little finicky about their litterboxes and will stop using them if they 're not perfectly clean . Since I work all day and the cats are on their own , I can count on these self-cleaning litter boxes to keep the box up to my cats ' high standards.My only complaint is LitterMaid 's quality control can be a little inconsistent . Over the years I 've had defective units right out of the box a little more often than I 'd like . I do n't think it 's unique to LitterMaid , I 've seen similar QC problems with just about anything made in China . If LitterMaid has a choice , they really should reconsider where they 're doing business . It 's at the point that if I have a choice between products either made in China or elsewhere , I choose the product NOT made in China just because I 've been burned too many times by shoddy workmanship , even from supposedly name brand products .	1
I 've tried the lift-out sifter , which I abandoned after a day . I tried that one that you roll for which you have to buy the crystal litter which is $ $ $ and starts smelling immediately . The rolly thing was a nightmare . Compared to these , I LOVE the Littermaid . That being said I 've found a few things are necessary to do to make it work at its best:1 ) Use Littermaid litter . Is more expensive but I do n't have to constantly throw all of it out so I think I break even . It clumps perfectly and I get very few leavings.2 ) Empty the recepticals when they are half full . This will help avoid the vile spatter and spilling . Alternatively , seal the top down before taking out the bottom section and then pull the whole thing out , empty it and then put the old set back ( I definitely reuse them ) .3 ) Do n't bother with the tent . It 's huge , the opening is n't wide enough to fully open the litter cover when you go to empty it and if your cat is as vigorous as mine at covering the litter , it will get in between the box and tent and is hard to clean . I find the height of the littermaid is enough that he does n't fling litter out the back or sides , just occasionally over the litter recepticle when it 's getting too full .	1
Over the years we have owned a couple of these and this model by far has been the best . Yes , it does get a little gummed up in the corners beside the rake , but in my experience owning 4 cats , this sure beats emptying litter boxes daily . I would recommend this to any cat owner that is tired of daily litter box duty .	1
I 'm on my third littermaid in about 12 months . We have 3 cats and it does get a workout . My only complaint is that the replacement machines have been used , or at least open package items- thus they have lasted for far less time than the original littermaid LM900 . Nonetheless , they 've all done a fairly good job at eliminating the chore and odors !	1
UPDATE:11/25/2008 The literbox broke down ( I believe it may have been due to a thunder/lightening storm we had ) and it has no power . I called Littermaid . They told me that it was under their one year warranty . They asked me to cut the white power cord on the rake and return it to them which I did . Within a week they sent me out a brand new litterbox . I am very pleased . Best Customer Service Ever ! A+++++I should tell you that I 've had this litter box before..About 6 years ago I had 3 cats and bought one of these litter boxes to save my sanity and my back . At the time that I purchased it , it SUGGESTED ( NOT REQUESTED ) that you use premium cat litter . At that time I saw it as a marketing ploy to get me to buy premium cat litter so I disregarded their suggestion..Bad mistake ... It was clogging at least once a week but at the time I still considered this to be nothing considering the fact that I wasnt having to scoop anymore . I had that unit for about 2 and 1/2 years and then it died on me . I still think I got a good deal out of it though.So recently I bought the same litter box again only this time it REQUIRES you to use the premium cat litter so I bought the `` scoop away '' cat litter at the supermarket . This litter is supposed to be better than the regular litter because it is more absorbent than the regular and it clumps and drys more quickly than the traditional kitty litter . Since the Littermaid Litter box rakes the litter 10 minutes after the cat leaves , you need a litter that can clump and dry quickly . Well , now I get this ! Since I bought the litter box ( 2 weeks ago ) I havent had any clogs and am actually using less Kitty litter than before since it clumps so well.The litterbox is turnkey provided you use the premium kitty litter . I am really glad I bought this product . I am happy ... Oh , another point , MAKE SURE YOU KEEP THE KITTY LITTER LEVEL BELOW THE SUGGESTED LINE . I have learned that the machine works harder ( and breaks more frequently ) if you put too much kitty litter in it . I keep the litter a little below the line . This works great .	1
Well , at least not much sifting and scooping . My cats have been using the LitterMaid for a couple of weeks now and I have removed the old stinky litterbox from the room . I had very little difficulty training the cats to use the new box ; I just followed the simple instructions that came with the Littermaid . The only difficulty I had in getting the cats accustomed to the new box was a teenager who thought it hillarious to yell boo at a cat as it watched the box clean itself . Needless to say , that cat took a little longer getting used to the LitterMaid and the teenager got the privelege of cleaning the old box.Just as it advertises , 10 minutes after use , the & quot ; sifter & quot ; runs from one end of the box to the other , lifting the clumps and depositting them in the container at the end . A few times it had a little difficulty with a very large clump and I heard it reverse and try again several times before successfully completing the trip . I do have a problem with litter being dumped on the floor , either by an energetic cat or the sifter pushing litter in front of a clump and over the edge.Do n't start thinking this will reduce how often you have to deal with a litter box . You still have to empty the container daily , add/rearrange the litter daily and probably vacuum frequently . It misses the really small clumps so you 'll have to sift once in a while . However , it only takes a minute to do these tasks and it really keeps down the smell . In addition , your kitties are using a much cleaner litter box which is better for them !	1
I have multiple cats and have tried many different litter boxes . With the exception of one unit , this has been my favorite of them all . As long as you have good clumping litter , it works beautifully . The only drawbacks are that it can be a little messy disposing of the waste and the litter goes around the unit , but it is easy to clean .	1
I left a review regarding Petmate Purrforma jumbo , it was a smelly , horrible mess . Well , I got lucky . My PetSmart told me to bring the Purrforma back and they would credit all toward a new Littermaid and supplys for it . There was even enough credit left for 2 30 # bags of the Nutro dog food I use . The Puurforma is so overpriced as well as poorly designed . I had the receipt for the Puurforma from the month before . I now have my 3rd multicat Littermaid and am very happy again . While not perfect , as litter cleaning will never be perfect , these do work well for me . I have one in the laundry room , one downstairs and the other at my farm . I have yet to find a cat that will not use this box . My cats at home are all over 10 years old . At the farm they are 2 years and younger . Hope this helps .	1
This is my second one . I will always use the self cleaning litter box . It is healthier for your cat ( s ) , easier on me and keeps your home cleaner . I live in an apartment and my manager complemented me on how `` well I care for my cats '' . My vet says my 14 year old cat looks 7 and I firmly believe this litter maid has something to do with it . He has had the litter main most of his life . My `` skid-dish '' cat , he uses all the time but waits to see it move , kind of funny . All I know is when this one goes , I will buy a new one again . These are worth every penny I spend to have another day with my cats .	1
I 've had mine for three years with two cats , and it still works just fine . I probably take it out and give it a thorough cleaning once a year.To save on receptacles , I line mine with two plastic grocery bags . When it 's full , I just pull up the bags , tie them off , and take it away . Line with new bags , and it 's good to go .	1
So here it is , the miracle product ? ? ? Yes and no ... If you still are willing to maintain a litterbox every couple days yes ... If you are not willing to do this , it wo n't help much to get this type litterbox . My years of previous experience with cats and boxes have proved quite informative so I 'll try to give you the low down and insight that hopefully will help.First , multi cat homes need checked daily , not necessarily changed , just checked . A large cat ca n't aim the center of the box , especially portly cats . They being large cats end up hitting the very end of the litter area with urine then the machine sweeps and it then clings a clump stuck to the plastic . This only happens once in a while when the cat is facing the machine area and his hind end toward the hopper . Otherwise , the other reason is a not totally clumped chunk of whatever that gets caught in the teeth then rides back to the original position where it dries and then becomes like concrete . A good brand of litter helps cure some of those problems.Through trial and error , Everclean litter is a great alternative to the brand that littermaid sells ... sold in pet store and amazon.If you have dogs , place the unit with the hopper away from where your dog can pull it out . My basset hounds would get the notion to dine and pulled the hopper out and it was n't a pretty site . I do n't have them anymore that was years ago they did that but the memory is still there ! Lastly , this LM900 is a bit quieter than the original , battery life is NOT what they say ... two months is not ever going to happen .	1
This cat box is a lifesaver . My vet recommended trying this when a Persian of mine started having issues of straying from the box . The vet said that some cats are just extra fastidious and no matter how many times a day a person scoops the box as long as there is anything at all in the box they will refuse to use it.I was hesitant at first to get this , fearing that the cat would be frightened of the motor and would become even more traumatized by the litter box . With great trepidation , I set the LitterMaid up , and from that moment on , there has never been a single instance of the cat straying from the box to do his business.Some people say that a motorized cat box is a waste of money , but it is well worth trying if you face a similar dilemma : it can save your sanity and your carpet , and may let some cats stay in loving homes instead of being abandoned or even euthanized.I am absolutely delighted with the LitterMaid , and have had no problems with it , and at this point mine is over two years old . I highly endorse the LitterMaid system .	1
This is my 4th littermaid in about 12-15 years . I 've always found them to be great , but not very long lived.My littermaids have serviced 2 cats at all times . So , if you are a single cat house , you could reasonably expect 5-7 years of use from one of these . The first unit 's motor died . The second , the spring in the power rake 's cord broke , and could n't reel in the cord anymore . The third ( my last ) up and died , no warning or otherwise . Just stopped running.My first Littermaid was the original . It lasted about 4 years . The next was the original `` Mega Advance '' and was the best when it was working . That only lasted about 3-4 years . The last Mega ( not advance ) lasted about 5-6 years , but was very noisy.This newer unit seems to be basically the same as the last Mega , but the motor is slightly more quiet and pushes the rake through the box at a faster clip . Both nice improvements . The included scoop has tines in it to clean out the rake , a great idea that only took 15 years ... .I 've never run my Littermaids on batteries , always using the A/C plug . If the power 's out for a few hours , we can survive , or if needed , scoop.If there was a way to make the system a bit more quiet it would be perfect.Tips:1 . Do n't over-fill the box . Use the bottom ( add litter ) line as the top fill line . If you fill to the top line , the system will not work as well . This seems to be the # 1 problem people have , adding too much litter.2 . Use a bit of cooking oil spray ( Pam ) on the bottom of the pan before you fill with litter . I rarely clean ours , but when I do , I always spray the bottom of the pan and that really helps keep the box cleaner and helps keep the nasty stuff from getting stuck to the bottom.3 . Use high-quality clumping litter . We get the big tub of Scoop-Away from Costco . That lasts more than a month for us.4 . Re-use the waste containers . They each should last a month or more . Just keep using them until they crack when you are removing to dump the contents . Then replace . Saves lots of money there.This would be a 5 star if it was just a bit more quiet overall .	1
This is our third LitterMaid litter box . The last two both stopped working after 2 - 3 years.I ca n't say anything about the long-term reliability of this one , but it 's quieter than the others and the motor sounds stronger.Our kitty has some really big , sticky output that the last one would get stuck in and either just sit in stripping out its gears or reverse and run back and forth . This one does n't even sound like it 's straining and just powers through.All the other design defects are still here - primarily that the litter does n't all land in the waste tub , and if there 's a big clump it can land so that the door stands wide open . But a little more power in the motor makes this a much better product.I did have a problem with the specific package we received - it was missing 11 of the 12 waste tubs , the carbon filters , and the little brush . But after a couple back-and-forth emails with Amazon ( who offered to accept a return , but kitty had already inaugurated the new one ) and Fox International , who makes the litterbox , two packages showed up with all the missing parts , shipped by Fox . Thank You Fox !	1
My cats love it and so do I. I no longer have cat litter flying out all over the floor as any litter they fling out stays in the tent . I have 3 of these and do n't think I could do without them . I believe my cats like the privacy as well .	1
I have been using the Cat Tent for years to cover my Littermaid Mega.Pros : provides coverage , privacy to the animals and offers some degree of odor control . Does not retain odor.Cons : Fits too tight , which causes the zipper to break and fail . Vinyl also discolors after 6 months or so and it can pick up stains fairly easily . COst is also a con - this thing along with all LitterMaid products is too expensive.Overall , I have owned several of these . Eventually , they start to look bad on the exterior and the zipper will fail . That 's really all I can say about it .	1
I had three kittens and they mad one hell of a mess , litter always kickied all ove rt he floor . useing this helped a lot to keep the litter where it beliongs . I still had a little out the front but only the first 6 inches or so . where before litter was in all directions . I will buy ans I would rcomend to anyone to buy this product .	1
The Privacy Tent is a must have IMHO . I just ordered my fifth one . The cats are very comfortable using them , they keep the litter mass off the floor , the litter box out of sight , and are easy to clean . I had absolutely no difficulty putting them together - a simple matter of inserting the support poles in FIRMLY and the tent fits just fine . My cats get on top of them sometimes , but none are broken.I just wish they were available in colors !	1
THESE WORK GOOD WITH THE LITTLE BOX . A LITTLE HARD TO GET THEM TO FIT IN THE LITTLE BOX LID HAVE TO BEND THEM WHEN TAKING THEM OUT ALSO OTHERWISE A GREAT DEAL , BETTER THAN THE STORE .	1
I love these . They make the clean up so much easier than having to clean the box manually . They might be thinner than they used to be but i have n't had an issue because of that . They work very well . If you want to reuse them you can buy the bags that are fitted for them to save money so you do n't have to keep buying more all the time .	1
I love this litter box . I do not use the lids , and keep using the same receptacle until it tears or cracks . ( Usually 3-4 months ) . I just dump it out a couple times a week . Makes these things last forever	1
We stopped using the automated litter box these go with because our cat would n't use it . However , we kept the receptacles for our manual litter box . It 's shocking how smell does n't escape the receptacle ! We keep it at the end of our box and add to it several times a day when we sift the litter , then we dump the litter into a bag then the trash and start all over . One receptacle lasts for a really long time . We love this product !	1
These are a lifesaver along with our automatic kittylitter box cleaner . The only thing I do n't like are the filters that you buy to go with them . I can NEVER keep them attached . maybe if they made that part of it less smooth so that the glue from the scent filter would actually stick , these would be perfect	1
I have used these for years ! Only 2 brands I would consider buying and this is one of them I buy !	1
have to use these to keep the smell contained . what else can I say . Littermaid is AWESOME - have had them for over 12 years and the kitties when they are new , have to stand and watch the system , then they are litter-maids for-Ever . Thank you !	1
These are a LOT cheaper through Amazon than purchasing locally . They are flimsy , but ... they are designed to be thrown away . I do n't want to spend quality time scrubbing a receptacle ! To be honest , I do n't even use the lids ... I simply put the filled receptacle in the trash and it all goes to the dumpster pronto . Its a great idea and my cats love it , it keeps my life simple .	1
Really have only used one and assume the others will work as well as the one I have used . Thanks !	1
These are the exact same ones that come with the littermaid . My original set came with carbon filters but this set did not . I can usually reuse them for several weeks . I 'll just dump it out for a week or so then hose it out if things start sticking to it . If your gentle enough this pack could last you a year .	1
Great	1
Arrived timely and intact . Cant believe that this product is no longer available . I love my Littermaid.No more words .	1
Working fine . We have lost our cats recently and will no longer use it . Will attempt to give to a deserving cat owner .	1
I was unsure if these were the correct items for our new litter box . But yes . The difference between the 200 and 300 series is the quantity in the box not the size of the container . Go figure . They hold up well to all of the use that they receive . A little thinner than the ones that come with the self-cleaning litter box in the box but have n't had any issues with them .	1
This is a good price for these . Not much else to say about them really . They fit in the litter box and contain cat poo .	1
I purchased this product more for use for chronic ear infections in my two dogs as it stated on the label that it regulates and helps keep ears healthy . It did not disappoint . Both of my dogs , who usually get monthly ear infections , have been all clear and healthy since starting taking this product . I just put the capsule directly in their food and they eat it with no problem . I will continue to use to keep my dogs ears healthy and infection free .	1
My Cat is suspected of having IBD . The Vet never suggested a Probiotic - no , they suggested Budesinide at about $ 2 a capsule . You really have to research things yourself . I found this a while back and started to add half a capsule to my cat 's wet food . He does n't gulp , just licks the food ( barely eating any of it ) but he must be taking in enough on a twice daily basis because he does n't throw up 3 to 4 times a week like he used to . ( same food-no change ) . The new Holistic Vet said Budesinide is a harsh medication and said I should look for another more natural thing . I researched and decided to try the Probiotics . It must be a routine , but I do believe in it . I noticed the formula has gone from White powder to a brownish powder in the capsule . I 'm not sure why , but if they are not 'bleaching ' it then I all for that . I just hope the ingredients are as good if not better ... .. Not sure , but so far it seems to be working as it did before . I may call the company to see what was changed . If I do , I will update this review .	1
This product is a very effective digestive remedy . I have been using it for both my 16 y/o cat and 13 y/o dog . It is very easy to open the capsule and add the appropriate portion of the capsule contents into their food . Neither pet seems to know it is there or , if they do , it does n't bother them . I have noticed that as a result of this remedy , their stools are firm .	1
This was recommended by a former pet store employee . I was talking to her about the diarrhea that my dog was having . She told me this would work within a day ... and I must admit , she was right . I have 3 dogs , 1 of which is always having normal stools , the second has intermittent diarrhea , and the third always has an issue with soft/loose stools . I initially tried it on my 2 and it cleared up the diarrhea with the one immediately . The other one who always had an issue with intermittent loose/watery stools , I had her on another regimen which over time gave her stools form , but it was rather costly and she did n't always like eating it ( herbal regimen ) . This , however , is very easy for me to give to her as she only requires one capsule of which I open into her bowl and mix with canned dog food then hand feed to make sure she eats it , and she eats it as if it were a treat . I can then feed her the normal dry kibble in her bowl afterwards . I am continuing this on a daily regiment with my one dog . I recommend it . The price is very reasonable and it is easily dispensed . I am not certain , but I guess you could also just feed the entire capsule to your dog , but I prefer opening it so I know it will work quickly.Update : August 2013 . I am now feeding 1 capsule daily to both of my dogs who had loose stool issues . Once their stools were firm ( within a couple of days of opening capsule and adding to wet food ) , I am now dispensing the entire capsule and everything is fine . I have one very finicky senior gal so she will only take her meds with peanut butter ( she ca n't spit it out as I scoop it on the roof of her mouth ) . Pill pockets work just as well with my other pooch , but since I have gone the route of peanut butter with one , they all get the peanut butter with pills ... and it 's much cheaper ! I still buy the 3-packs of these capsules from Amazon.com when my supply is getting low , but only using 1 capsule daily per dog , it takes a few months to empty 3 bottles . I still highly recommend this product and am very pleased with it . I have even told my veterinarian about it and she is impressed as well .	1
I 'm a big believer in probiotics . These products are meant to replenish your intestinal bacteria after a stint with antibiotics , or just to help keep it in tip-top shape . The idea has been around for centuries , but it 's only been the last few decades that science understands why those who eat natural products like yogurt seem to be a bit healthier than others.Did you know that most of the immune system is in the gut ? Makes sense when you think about it . When we eat , there are billions of bacteria , fungus , and viruses on our food . ( Viruses are n't a big problem , since they do n't use food as a substrate ; they look for living tissue to thrive in . ) The stomach with its high acidity helps kill most bacteria and fungus , but some survive and get to the small and large intestine , where they can cause disease that is commonly called food poisoning . Part of the problem is when there is missing 'good ' bacteria that has been killed off or dies for some reason . This niche may be filled by the bad bugs , leading to an unbalanced fauna in the gut.Pets have the same problem as we do . And you know what a dog will eat ; just about anything ! I find that regular use of a probiotic will help keep diarrhea under control , and makes the pet feel better . Cats , too , can have digestive problems , and this type of product will probably help.The Gentle Digest seems to work well , and it reasonably easy to administer . Recommended .	1
I purchased this product after my 1 year old mini aussie began having diarrhea/loose stools on a daily basis . She was n't sick , and combined with some other symptoms ( oral papillomas , vomiting on an empty stomach ) and the research I did , I decided a probiotic would be the way to go . I went with Gentle Digest because it had excellent reviews and was the cheapest probiotic I found , so I ordered it and tried it out . Let me tell you , this stuff reall works ! After about 3 days of giving 2 capsules a day ( like some other reviewers I just cracked them open over her food ) her stools were back to their nice , firm selves lol and after only about a week her oral papillomas fell off ! I have since been able to stop giving this , but plan on always keeping a bottle on hand , especially whenever either of my dogs is prescribed an antibiotic ( which I think caused all of these issues in the first place -- antibiotics at 6mos old wiped out the natural flora in her gut and affected her immune system ) . I highly recommend this product , you wo n't be disappointed ! !	1
This is the best price I have found for this product . Shipping was very fast .	1
First , the noise level is low . Nothing that 's going to drive humans crazy . Second , the Wiggly Giggly Ball is everything it promises to be . Tough , makes low-level noise , and requires no batteries . Love that . Though my current dog did n't go bonkers over this ball , I 've had dogs who loved batting them about . My dog is into noisy toys but not balls so much . But I 'd still recommend the Wiggly Giggly Ball for its quality and durability .	1
My puppy loves this thing . She wo n't play with it for a long time but when she does it is all out fun . She barks at it and chases it around the room . She is only 5lbs and I thought this would be too big for her but she plays with it just fine .	1
As our dog is small , { 11 pounds } this is perfect . he is so funny trying to find out where the sounds come from . Great entertainment for the whole family..	1
I would not give this to a chewer . One of my dogs loved this and played with it but the other ... destructo girl got a hold of it and destroyed within mins . Soft plastic . Otherwise , great amusing product for dogs .	1
My blind dog loves this product , but unless it 's couched inside a large 'ferret ball , ' his teeth destroy it within just a few minutes . Make Wiggly Giggly a more hard and less 'squeezable ' product and it will deserve a 5-star rating !	1
My pup has larger ball that makes much more noise . I threw it and it would make small noise . dog love the largerbroken one better .	1
Great toy , but toy will not last long with a pet that likes to chew . A tougher material on the exterior would make this a must buy .	1
I love the Wiggly Giggly , even though it lost it 's giggle pretty quickly due to high playing usage , my dogs loved it and still take it out of the toy box !	1
The ball makes this cute funny noise when its in motion . I play soccer with him with this ball and he loves to play with it . Great toy ... I recommend it to all new puppy owners .	1
It is working GREAT ! It 's clean and you do n't have to clean the waste yourselve . My cat also having fun watching it !	1
I was amazed to see some negative comments about littermate.My has been working fine for five years . No mechanical problems at all . The instructions say to empty the container once a week . My cat fills it in five days . So I schedule myself to empty it twice a week . Is it Monday or Thurs ? Time to clean the litter box.It does take expensive litter , but you use less . I find that emptying all the litter and starting over needs to be done about one a month . I do check the box on a daily basis . That is easy for me as it not located in an out of the way place.Yes , it does make noise . But , that just tells me the cat has been there . I only change the container when I empty the box . Works find to simply empty it and replace . I use baby oil in the bottom to help keep it from sticking.One funny story is that the first time my cat heard it she ran out of the room . Now she puts her head over the top and watches the rake . It is quite humorous to watch .	1
I have to admit the thought of dropping [ $ $ ] on a LITTER BOX was a scary prospect ! But , as I am sharing my one-bedroom apartment with two kitties , I was desperate for a solution to the inevitable odor problem . As I work full-time outside the home , it seems the box is never as fresh as I 'd like , and there is no place to `` hide '' it - like a lot of homeowners who keep the litter box in the basement , or some such out-of-the-way location.One day after setting up our new LitterMaid , I was completely sold ! All embarrassing odors were gone ! I am happy to use my little hand-vac to clean up the kicked-out litter every few days in exchange for an apartment that no longer smells like a litter box.Also , some reviewers have brought up the issue of cat litter : buy the best-quality clumping litter you can . The system uses so little of it compared to traditional boxes that it 's a wise investment towards a smooth-running system.All-in-all , it 's my opinion that the legitimate drawbacks ( litter mess , noise , container cost , sticky clumps , etc . ) are a small price to pay for a house that is n't stinky !	1
I 've owned a LitterMaid for the last 6 or 7 years . These units are generally reliable . The biggest benefit is the odor control . The dirty stuff is raked into a plastic catch-bin that has a lid . The smell is kept to a minimum , until the catch-bin is too full and the lid does n't close fully.My first LitterMaid 's retractable power cord ( on the rake ) stopped recoiling into the unit , so it eventually got snagged on the rake , and it broke . That was after more than 3 years of use . Not bad for a product that runs at least 10-15 times a day ( I 've got 2 cats ) . My second LitterMaid has been going strong since I replaced the last one well over 2 years ago.The most important thing I can suggest is using *premium* clumping litter . I 've been very happy with the ScoopAway brand . Cheap litter breaks apart and makes a mess . The next thing is to keep the litter level below the `` max fill '' line . Too much litter causes the rake to bog down . Also , cooking oil spray ( pam ) works very well to keep the clumps from sticking to the bottom.I use the `` disposable '' catch pans over and over until they crack . I can normally get 2 or 3 months before I consider changing it out . I ca n't imagine tossing it out after one filling . That 's a big expense , and a waste of money and a perfectly operable item . I do n't use a liner/bag in the catch . Just dump the dirty stuff into a bag and out to the trash . I have two cats and they can fill the catch-bin in 2 to 3 days . Normally , I just dump the bin , use a scoop to quickly get the smaller bits missed by the rake , and that 's it . I have gone well over 6 months before doing any major cleaning of the box.If you have more than one cat , I would get the `` Mega '' model , since it is bigger . The new Advanced model is n't getting good reviews here at Amazon , so I would keep away from that unit.The LitterMaids are a bit noisy . That maybe the biggest drawback . Also , it is not a perfect cleaner , and will leave little bits that need to be scooped by hand every few days . There are times when litter will build up in the back of the pan , and the rake will cycle over and over until you level things off ( this can mostly be avoided by not filling to the top fill line ) . It takes a few weeks to work out all the kinks , but once you do , you will love it.I will always own a LitterMaid because it keeps the house smelling like we do n't have cats .	1
I like hiking with my dog and purchased this collapsible bowl for our outdoor excursions.I also use it whenever I take him to the vet or in the car . Dogs over heat in this weather very quickly , carrying water is essential.This bowl is handy and easy to slip into your pocket , just put it on a flat surface and fill it with water or food.My dog has n't gotten the opportunity to chew it because I take it away as soon as he 's finished.This is one of the more sturdier bowls I 've found and I 'm very satisfied with it .	1
The water bowl was exactly as I had hoped . It 's large enough for a large dog , but can be turned downed to make a smaller animal able to drink from it . It 's attractive and light-weight and good for traveling , biking or hiking . The shipping was really quick , too .	1
We bought two of these . One for food and one for water . The sides on the bowl are high enough that the water does not splash out while driving . The seams are done very well and do not leak at all . We had water in the bowl for over a week while out of town for the holidays . I would surely recommend this to other people .	1
Love this . Always in the car . It works great and is very versatile . Thanks for an awesome product . Planet Dog makes the best stuff .	1
Nice little collapsing bowl . The only improvement I would suggest is that the opening is kind of square and a bit smaller than the bowl base so it can be kind of tight for a larger dog and previous , more round bowls we have owned were a bit more friendly . However , it works just fine , and looks good .	1
So far that best collapsable dog dish I have found . The shape makes it more likely to stand up and not allow the water to overrun or tip it over as easily . The colorful material helps me to keep track of it while packing things up , or when setting it down for use .	1
my dobe puppy loves to play w/ this but after a week he has peeled off parts of the continents -- have to examine and cut loose pieces off -- expect the ball to be solid blue at some point in the not too distant future -- the puppy also chewed through rope covering w/in two days of play -- except for peeling and rope issues ( which require careful supervision ) would have rated higher for puppy satisfaction	1
My Doberman just loves this toy . Soft on the teeth and easy for her to carry around at the park . I do n't use tennis balls because of the glue , so this is perfect ! Will be getting a smaller one for my Pomeranians	1
when i pull out this toy.. my dog goes bonkers .. great for building drive.. or just for fun	1
Like other Planet Dog toys , this ball is good , but not the best . The knot in the rope comes undone quickly , so you will have to tie it again . Also , if you have a constant chewer/mouther on balls ( and do n't just use it for fetching ) , the outer shell of the ball can come apart off of the inner shell that has the continents on it . But that is usually after lots and lots of chewing . Other than that , my dogs LOVE these balls . They love the softness and the chewability .	1
This is a very cute little Lambchop doll . I bought 3 of them for my little dogs ' Christmas presents . These dog toys seem to be fairly tough and they 're very cute . A nice gift for your pup .	1
I do n't know how this guy is still around and yelling when the pugs have had him for about a month but he is . Very cute . I do n't know if it sends the best kind 've message to your dog , but darn cute and durable .	1
I would never have order this dog toy- but after reading the reviews I thought I would try Mr Bill . He was an instant hit . I do n't know why . My puppy has tons of toys , but loves Mr Bill .	1
I bought Mr. Bill for my puppy . Alas , puppy is far too young to have watched and enjoyed Mr Bill on SNL . His reaction to the toy was a politely horrified look saying `` What on earth IS that thing ? '' After it became obvious that puppy had no intention of ever playing with Mr. Bill , I took the toy into work . Mr. Bill now spends his day wailing `` Ohhh Noooo '' as he sails back and forth over the cube walls .	1
Awesome ! One large black Labrador named Sammi girl can not put this down ! She normally shares but this is sacredly guarded from her big brother Bear Cub . Hee hee !	1
My dog got this toy as a birthday present back in Sept . He loves it and it still works so the batteries last a really long time . It 's pretty durable and it 's cute .	1
So , do n't expect it to be a toy they 'll love for years . It was cute while it lasted , and drove the dog nuts until she destroyed it . She can be very focused . And , is n't that really the point ?	1
Got this as a 'present ' for my roommate 's dog because her old toy was destroyed . Figured it 'd be safe because my own dog is really particular about her toys , and so I 'd only get one.That was a mistake . The instant I pulled the toy out both dogs wee enthralled , and are now engaged in a very long game of hide-and-seek/ keepaway . I 'm pretty positive I will be ordering another monkey in the immediate future.The sock monkey version of this toy is a nice soft plush with that does n't have 'long hair ' or anything - it just feels like , well , a soft cotton sock . It 's a good size and the limbs are different shapes/widths , which is great because that means dogs with any type of muzzle can pick it up and run with it.I highly recommend this to anyone who 's looking for new all purpose puppy toys . We fetch , play tug of war and chase with this toy- it 's brilliant !	1
My 20 month old German Shepherd shredded Mr. Bill in less than two weeks . Oh ! He loved the toy and always kept him close , even sleeping with him . However , for a reason known only to `` Igor '' , he got carried away one day and shredded Mr. Bill into microscopic pieces . I managed to salvage the voice box , but Mr. Bill has no body now to go with his voice . However , since Mr. Bill was a favorite and is reasonably priced , I have ordered Igor yet another one for his Xmas stocking .	1
This may be the best of all the Mutipet toys ! Previously gave great reviews of others , but this one never stops ! They bite it , step on it , sit on it and hide it from each other . It always gives itself away tho with its `` OOOOONNNOOOOOO ! ! ! ! '' I keep 2 around here and have given several to friends . I think it 's particularly popular with those of us who remember Mr Bill , but it sure translates to the dogs ! While these are really durable for us I do n't think real chewers will take long to dismantle this . My guys are over 80lbs bot do n't chew or pull things apart .	1
This is a great soft toy . It 's funny and dogs love it ! My only complaint is it 's kind of thin , so I do n't think it will last too long , but it 'll be fun while it lasts and the price was great !	1
To heck with the dogs or cats ! I got this for myself to play with ! I press the belly and out comes OHHH NOOO . Comes in handy on occasions to bring levity to ponderous situations , like the tax bill , marital debates , forgot to get something at the grocery store , an unexpected expense , lost Amazon order ; you know all those life situations where you just need to bring humor into the situation . We are enjoying using it in our household . The cat , though , did bat at it , tried to run with it thinking it was his . OHHH NOOOO , I said . Not a lasting quality item , but a fun time .	1
Great sturdy dog toy . They still love it !	1
Dog loves it and it does give me flashbacks of & # 34 ; oh no & # 34 ; so far it has held up well so we will see	1
My rescue dog absolutely loves this toy . She will carry it around the house , and generally uses it as a pillow when sleeping . By far her favorite toy out of the multiple toys we 've given her . : )	1
I bought these for a friend because her pup loves these things and he needed backups . My friend told me that I got all three for *LESS* than what she paid at the local ( big name ) pet supply store . Ca n't go wrong on this if your pup loves the Lambchop .	1
This is a great dog toy for all size dogs . When the dog picks it up it says `` Oh Noooooo '' Our dog really likes to hear it talk . This is the third or fourth one we have had , the others just wore out over the years .	1
I got this for my dogs but I 'm keeping it for myself ! ! It is sooo cute and when you squeeze it the sound is perfect ! !	1
Not only does my dog love this toy , but so do I ! ! ! I have a Westie and he loves to fetch Mr. Bill and then toss him around and shake him . He gets really excited when he hears the `` Ohhhh Noooooooo '' : - ) Watching him makes me laugh and laugh - it is wonderful fun ! Before I gave Mr. Bill to my pup , I had taken him to work . Everyone that remembers Mr. Bill from Saturday Night Live laughed and loved him ! I ended up being asked to pick up FIVE more for friends ! The one reviewer mentions the inside voice box - many of the dog toys I buy my dogs have a voice box - I just do n't let them have those toys for long or without supervision . When the toy gets ripped , I either sew it back up or take out the voice box.I do n't think ANY toy is supposed to be given to a pet without some type of supervision - it just is n't safe.If you , or your friends remember Mr. Bill -- buy this and laugh !	1
My dog is an 80lb . mixed breed who just loves to pull the stuffing out of any and every toy . Mr. Bill far outlasted any thing with a squeaker in it because of his speaking box . When the dog started getting a little rough , the & # 34 ; Ohhhhhh Nooooooo ! ! ! & # 34 ; would make him stop . Ahhhh , but it was not to be . Mr. Dog conquered Mr. Bill , but it took him over 2 months to slowly and painfully , bit by tiny bit , get the stuffing out -- first at the nose , then slowly , hour by hour , day by day , then entire head was emptied , and VIOLA ... 2 months later Mr. Bill no longer had a voice ... alll bets were off , he is now nothing but the shell of the toy he used to be . But he 's still good to play tug of war with . I already got Mr. Dog another one but I 'm saving it for Christmas .	1
So this is now the 4th Mr. Bill in the last 6 years . I think my dog has torn up 1 after about 1 year of having it and the other 2 have been killed via circumstances beyond my dog 's control ( one was mistakenly left outside and peed on ... repeatedly , and the other was left at a coffee shop ( but I think someone stole it ) . When I pulled Mr. Bill out of the box , my dog 's face lit up like it was the best day ever and he carried it around crying and wiggling and making Mr. Bill say & # 34 ; OH NOOOOOOOOOOOOO & # 34 ; . Its entertaining for the dog and definitely for us ( we like to ask him questions and then hear Mr. Bill say & # 34 ; OH NOOOOOOOOOOOOOO & # 34 ; ) . He takes Mr. Bill to bed with him every night along with his teddy bear and spiderman ball and Mr. Bill has to go everywhere with us ... along with his teddy bear and spiderman ball ( the dog is n't spoiled at all ) . As long as Mr. Bill can be purchased , there will be one in the house .	1
i bought this for my puppy , but my older dog loved it , too . They have fun playing with this . It is a nice size and pretty durable considering two dogs are chewing on it .	1
My dogs both love the sock monkey . They play with it all the time . I all ready had to sew the arm back on so it really is not that sturdy . My dogs are hard on all the toys they have so I am not surprised .	1
This is the perfect size for a medium sized dog and so adorable . Our dog loves the squeaking and chewing on the ears . Very durable and a great price .	1
My puppies love these sock monkeys , and I am pleasantly surprised at how well they hold up to aggressive play .	1
my pooch LOVES this toy . He is used to squeaky toys , so the & # 34 ; ooooooh noooooo & # 34 ; sound effect is a nice change , and it seems to intrigue him . I 'm glad he likes it because it makes us laugh to see Mr. Bill being chewed on and tossed around just like the good old days of SNL	1
I originally purchased just one of these , but after my other dog saw it ( she almost never plays with toys , while the other loves toys ) I knew that i was going to have to order another ! They have lasted a pretty good time considering my dog usually tears through & # 34 ; heavy dog toys & # 34 ; in about a week !	1
My 70 pound Lab loves this toy ! She is a bit scared , but still interested enough to play with it . She is a chewer so I had to cut off the nose because she was trying to eat it , but other than that she has not chewed the toy up . She got one for Christmas and accidentally broke it when I threw it and she caught it and her tooth hit the box that makes the noise . I ordered 2 more for her . This is her favorite toy and it is durable .	1
Mr Bill says & # 34 ; oh noooooo & # 34 ; when the dogs put him in their mouths . They love him . I put all their toys away and he 's back out every day .	1
This is her second Mr.Bill . She loved the first one , but eventually chewed open the back and removed the battery pack . The three button batteries are a definite hazard for pets , so I only let her play with Mr. Bill under supervision .	1
Our two Schnauzers love this toy . As with most toys , if they last six months , I 'm happy . It 's been about six months and Mr. Bill is going strong . Our Schnauzers are pretty smart . They know their toys names and will retrieved them when called . This one is called & # 34 ; Oh No ! & # 34 ; , what Mr Bill calls out . As soon as we say OH NO ! they are searching for Mr Bill.When we travel , Mr Bill is one of the toys that they look for in their travel bag . It has been a lot of fun for the dogs and for us too .	1
my sister 's dog is IN LOVE with Mr. Bill . i 've given her at least 3 or 4 since she was a puppy ( 7 now ) and she adores this little guy . fun , inexpensive , adorable toy .	1
My goodness ; my brother bought me one of these for Christmas in 2012 as a gift for my dog . My dog is a toy lover , but when he realized Mr. Bill also talked when he was bitten , he fell in love . Mr. Bill has been his favorite toy ever since , in spite of the fact that he stopped saying `` oh nooo '' after about 2 days . It felt like the sound box came apart but there 's no way to fix it without cutting the doll open . Regardless of the lack of sound , Roscoe carried Bill everywhere and put him through many doggy ER operations . Alas , doggy-medicine failed to save Bill 's internal organs . He lasted about 6 months but was definitely worth every penny . Even without any stuffing , I kept the doll because Roscoe kept crying at the trash can when I tried to throw him away . Your dog will love one.Update : Mr. Bill # 2 had a shorter lifespan than Bill # 1 , but it may have been due to holiday stress . He now joins Bill # 1 's lifeless body on the shelf . Roscoe has mel been experimenting on Mr. Bill # 3 for about 6 weeks , destroying moderately . Basically , I 've come to find that each Bill doll 's lifespan is going to be dependent on the dog , so if you 're really interested in a long lasting toy , this may not be the one for you.To help put the toy 's size into perspective ( and also to show just how attached my dog has become to Mr. Bill ) , I have uploaded a picture of Bill and doggy cuddling ; it can be found in the Customer Images section on the right side of the product page alongside several other photos from very happy Bill owners .	1
my puppy loves mr.bill but despite all the 'oohhhhhhh , noooooooos ' . mr bill has been hospitilized on several occassions . he recovers , returns to play & is soon back in hospital . we 're were thinking of signing him up for the ACA but it 's just too pricey	1
Kira loves her Mr. Bill plush toy . She had one once before and played with him all of the time . We had a large dog visitor that crushed him , so he could no longer talk . Kira would bring him to me like & # 34 ; Mom , he does n't talk anymore ... fix him ! & # 34 ;	1
Too cute ! Takes me back ... . I HAD to purchase it as soon as I saw it . I bought it for my dog b/c I knew she 'd rip it to shreds and Mr. Bill would cry out at the same time . What a riot ! ! ! My dog is a lab and would gently carry Mr. Bill around in her jowls . When she 'd bite down , Mr. Bill cried out - cracks me up . She played tug-o-war with it with my sister 's dog , too . Within a short period of time , Mr. Bill was sadly torn to shreds , but it was fun while he lasted !	1
Mr. little 8 month old female puppy loves this toy best of all . It 's unique `` oh noooo '' sound is activated by pushing a spot on the tummy area and whenever she hears that she comes running ready to play . A couple of times lately she has accidentally made its `` voice '' go off too which she seemed to like also . It 's good to throw holding by one arm so it does `` cartwheels '' . I have two dogs actually , both under 10 pounds , and sometimes the two of them both grab and arm and play tug of war after I throw it which is fun too . It 's holding up very well but nonetheless I 'm getting another because she likes it so much and I do n't want to be left empty-handed if the other one quits working or if it just gets too dirty . Me and my two dogs give it a definite thumbs up .	1
A great talking toy featuring the famous & # 34 ; Oh nooooo ! & # 34 ; Our dog loves it and it 's hilarious to see her reaction to the sound it makes when she squeezes it . Priceless ! One of our dog 's favorite toys !	1
I bought this toy because we have a running joke in my house basically saying that one of my three Pekingese loves to make toys with squeaks in them `` scream '' . He only plays with a toy that has a squeak in it until it does n't squeak anymore , then moves onto the next . I bought Mr. Bill for him , because I thought that he would love the `` Oh NO ! '' sound and sure enough ... instant hit . He carried Mr. Bill all over the house with him and we always knew where he was because we could hear the `` Oh NO ! '' sounds from all over the house . Sadly , Mr. Bill has been retired , because he was taken out into the yard in the rain and got muddy and as I ca n't wash him with his battery pack in , I threw him away until I can buy another one . Anyway , great toy ! Ca n't wait to get him back into our house !	1
We are on , I believe , our fourth or fifth one of these . You may assume by that they they are not indestructible , and you would be correct . However , in every violent `` casualty , '' another dog has been the 'killer . ' My dog LOVES these things and treats them like they are her baby . She carries them to bed , she licks and licks them . The licking was the `` cause of death '' for at least one of them ; I have another around that 's still intact but looking rather haggard from being so well loved ( so we have a new one as a 'spare ' ) . She LOVES the FIVE squeakers , and it 's a great soft , squishy size . ( FYI , my dog is a 7-year-old 70lb Golden Retriever female ; she 's typically somewhat gentle on stuffies , although she 's certainly destroyed her fair share , too ) . For MYYYY dog ( and I know this does n't work with all dogs ) , if she sees me cuddle and pet her toy for a while first before letting her play with it , she tends to not destroy it ( or , at least , not as quickly ) . I 'm not sure if it 's because it gets my scent on it or if she decides that my actions mean it 's to be 'babied . '' I guess I 'm playing into her maternal instinct . This has absolutely been her FAVORITE toy for the LONGEST of all , so I definitely recommend it if stuffies are at all an option for your dog .	1
Mr. Bill is a toy for my dog , and when you push his stomach he go & # 34 ; Ooooooooooooo Noooooooooooooooooo ! My dog ca n't quite figure out of he 's hurting it , or what , but my dog had her ears all perked up , trying to figure it out ! ! ! It is cute watching her play with it .	1
Little did I know when I boughtMr . Bill , that when chewed , he cries out `` Oh nooooooo ! '' just like his SNL tv namesake ! Lady , my black lab absolutely loves this toy . When we gave her Mr. Bill two months ago , she forgot about her other toys for almost a month . She has started playing with her other toys again , but this is still her favorite.The only drawback is , because of the `` Mr. Bill '' sound-maker , it can only be surface-washed . This is Lady 's only toy that ca n't be tossed in the washer and dryer , but it 's worth it to see my Lady with this toy . I 'm going to buy a few more , just to have on hand , in case Mr. Bill gets too dirty to surface wash . I only wish they had a Mr. Hand dog toy to go with this . ; - )	1
This toy is carried around by our rescue Jack Russell and has not been ripped to pieces , we like to think it is because he thinks of it as a human and loves it . He has many because humans are not supposed to keep saying Oh No as it get on anyone 's nerves even a dog .	1
This particular Lambchop Toy is very well made , had a good loud squeaker in it , but most importantly is soft and comforting to my & # 34 ; big baby & # 34 ; , a 75 pound Labrador Retriever ! ! He had a smaller sized one about two years ago , and he loved it to death by sleeping on it , carrying it in his mouth , regular tooth pulling play time , and we finally had to retire the scraps of what was left ( when he was not looking , of course ... . ) . He looked for Lambchop for awhile , but he gave up . I was so discouraged that I could n't find one ANYWHERE . THEN , I was so pleased to see a new and BIGGER one on Amazon ! ! The Price was outstanding , and my Labrador and his Lambchop are back to being cuddle buddies again . This is a great dog toy . I highly recommend it .	1
My dog loves all things that squeak . This toy is especially entertaining bc when it says `` oh no ! '' my dog brings it to me to `` fix '' . It 's funny to watch and the dog has a good time tossing Mr Bill around . It 's surprisingly durable ( it 's still around and it 's been about a month ) . Good fun !	1
This toy is just great ! I originally bought one from Target ( on sale for about $ 2.00 ) and my dog just feel in love w/ this him . He was playing with him , sleeping with him and he has to have Mr. Bill next to him at all times for next few days ... Then somehow , we lost him ... . so I had to buy him another Mr. Bill ! He still loves to play with him and I think the sound he makes is just great ! : ) Totally recommend this product to any dog owners.. My dog is a 15 lb maltipoo btw	1
The actual toy lasted only a few weeks but for what it was you knew it would n't last longer than a rope toy with a dog that likes to chew more than some dogs.Cons : -the arm stuffing came out first-the plush material got really gross with drool on the outside more than other dog toy materialPros : -Mr. Bill iconic soundmaker that says `` Oh Noooooo ! '' still working great-batting inside can be reused to make a whole new toy.For those inclined to make their money go further and give Mr. Bill 's words new life I have instructions on how you can remake this dog toy into a new one : To reuse the soundmaker I left the soundmaker in Mr. Bill 's head because the batting ( stuffing ) there provided pretty good protection . I removed the batting from the rest of the body and placed Mr.s Bill 's head with the soundmaker inside into a long men 's sock ( think sock monkey ) . I placed more batting around Mr. Bill 's head to give soundmaker more cushioning . Suggestion : it may be a good idea to use packing tape on the outside of the soundmaker itself to keep it intact ( just in case you have dog that likes to chew ) . One sock is not enough cushion surrounding Mr. Bill 's head though because holes can be made easily into just one sock layer and the jaw pressure from a dog 's mouth could break the plastic on the soundmaker . Because of this , I suggest 2-3 socks ( short or long on the inside ) with the outermost sock long because then you can tie 2-3 knots at the end . What you have is a long body that you can draw some eyes on with permanent marker on one end of the body and the knots at the other end will be like a rope toy.Pros from this design : -dog can play with either end of the toy.-person can throw toy ( without much drool ) with the knotted end easily.-more stuffing= more protection for the soundmaker you wanted to reuse.-it 's easier to notice when the toy is being destroyed- then you just rewrap in another sock !

This toy is one of my Standard Poodle 's favorites . She loves Mr. Bill and his mournful , & # 34 ; oh no. & # 34 ; She likes to carry Bill around and make him talk to her . It is well made and a good toy for SNL lovers .	1
Seriously . She was my Maltese puppy 's first stuffed plush toy and is his favorite . I got Lambchop because I thought she might remind him of his litter mates and he has loved her from the very beginning . If you see him without Lambchop in sight , all you have to do is ask him where Lambchop is and he will go running to find and bring her back.Lambchop is very well made . She has to be to withstand the daily tumbles she has to endure with the puppy . Not one seam has come loose , nothing except she 's beginning to look pretty grungy and I 'm not so sure about touching her any more without washing my hands afterward . I 've ordered some stuffed animal cleaner and sure hopes it works.And , uh , this is kinda sensitive and I 'm not sure the pup would want me to share , but I think it 's time to call the vet .	1
A friend got this as a gift for my dogs & my Taiwan Mountain Dog puppy ( 1yo ) claimed it as his own . He absolutely LOVED it when he chompd down on it & it screamed `` OH NOOOOO ! ! ! '' He got to the point where if I mimicked the `` OH NOOO '' he would squeeze the toy if he had it & run to find it if he didnt.Jack didnt tear it up for a long time - several weeks - but once he did , the stuffing in the head came out first - then the arms & legs . Once he started in on the body , I took it from him & removed the machine parts & he actually carried it around for another couple weeks like it was a security blanket . Even though it no longer spoke , he still knew to go & find it when I said `` OH NOOO '' to him . lolThis was , by far , Jack 's most favorite toy & I 'll be getting him another one - along w/several others for the future . ; o )	1
Not the & # 34 ; Ohhhhhh noooooooo ! & # 34 ; again ! This toy gets to be very annoying because that 's all it says but it 's fun to see the look on the dog 's face when Mr. Bill says it . This toy is not for destructive breeds or if the dog does n't use the soft mouth . The box inside breaks if dog chews on it alone . It has stuffing in it but if you want and know how to , you just sew it back up . It 's a fun toy but easy to break . This was the 3rd toy I 've bought for the dog . She likes the & # 34 ; Ohhhh noooo ! ! ! & # 34 ;	1
Something about sock monkeys ! Kids and animals love them ! I purchased this for my large miniature Cockapoo puppy . He loves that it is floppy , and it miraculously has survived puppy teeth ! I am amazed . Most of his floppy animals were destroyed . This is obviously made well . Good for medium to small dogs . Am looking for a giant version , as puppy is growing fast .	1
So , Mr. Bill is not the sturdiest of dog toys , but he 's hilarious . It 's a great toy to give the dog when we have company over , because his 'Oh Nooooooooooo ' squeaker makes everyone laugh . Our pitbull/rotweiller beheaded Mr. Bill in a few days , but the squeaker has survived , and our dog is terrified of it . If he 's doing something naughty , we pull out Mr. Bill 's squeaker , and the & # 34 ; Oh Noooooooo ! & # 34 ; stops him in his tracks . Worth the money , for sheer entertainment value .	1
This is a durable and soft plush doggie toy - The dogs have a small basket full of toys , but Lambchop is one of their fav 's to pick out of the box and tussle around.Has a couple squeaker 's - so if that drives you crazy you may want to consider something different.Lambchop has also been machine washed and dried in the dryer ( on low temp ) several times and survived just fine.I have even purchased them a replacement for when the old one does bite the dust , they will have another -	1
Dogs really take to this dog toy , and anyone from the days when Saturday Night Live was new will remember Mr. Bill saying & # 34 ; Oh no ! & # 34 ; whenever Sluggo was being mean . The toy says that when squeezed in the middle . Fun and well made !	1
I bought this for my one-year old Chocolate lab mix and she loves it ! When you squeeze it hard enough , he screams , & # 34 ; Oh No ! & # 34 ; and I laugh every time . She did bring in my bedroom at 2AM and squeeze it and it scared the daylights out of me , but other than that , it 's a great toy . My dog does n't chew toys apart so it 's held up well for us .	1
Bought this toy for my Golden when he was 7 months old , it was a lot of fun for him while it lasted , maybe one month .	1
My dogs love this toy . I wish there was some way to replace the batteries when they inevitably wear out . For now , though , poor Mr. Bill is providing lots of fun for my two mutts .	1
I did n't know this was a dog toy . I did n't buy it for my dogs . I saw it one day in a store and it cracked me up . I did n't buy it then , I came home and ordered it some time later on amazon.com . I bought it for my adult son for Christmas . I will warn him not to chew on it .	1
my puppy went crazy for Mr Bill when I gave it to him . It is now his favorite doy . It is super cute and this -oh nooo- drives him nuts.Mr Bill is a MUST for every dog ! ! !	1
We have a chewer in the family so I knew this would n't last long . Fortunately , our dog was content for a while just playing catch with it and experimenting with what would set the sound sensor off . Eventually , she nabbed it and went into a chewing session and went straight for the battery compartment . However , we did know this is n't a chew toy . The battery lasted the four weeks until he was destroyed . We all had fun going around the house listening to Mr. Bill and his & # 34 ; oh no & # 34 ; cries . If they made a durable version of this I 'd buy in a second .	1
I recently got a puppy who is chewing on everything , except most of the puppy toys . This is one of the exceptions . He loves it . His two favorite things are his Mr. Bill doll and his bully stick . Both of them are holding up well . If I activate the & # 34 ; Oh , noooooo & # 34 ; sound , he pounces on it and jumps around . If he activates it in his mouth , he does a demonstration of the shaken baby syndrome and runs around the house . I am amazed at the abuse this toy has taken . If he ever destroys it , I will be getting him another . As to the reviewer who bought it for his brother , not realizing it was a dog toy , I am sure any fan of Mr. Bill ( and maybe even those who have never heard of Mr. Bill ) would love to have this doll .	1
I have a 4-mo-old border collie mix , and she loves this doll . It 's solidly built , and can withstand quite a bit of tug-of-war . I do n't think that an adult German shepherd or pitbull mix would have any trouble destroying it in minutes , but my dog is generally rather nice to her toys , so that 's not much of a concern . That said , I own a number of stuffed dog toys , and this one feels better-made than pretty much any of them.The soundbox is located in the upper chest , and the trigger is a little finicky ... You have to squeeze it in just the right way to make it go off . Which would normally be a problem , but considering the loudness of the `` OH NOOOO ! `` , I 'm not complaining that it ca n't go off every 10 seconds ; ) .I 'm nearing age 30 , and the Mr. Bill sketches on SNL were some of my favorites as a kid . Makes me realize how long ago the 80 's were though , considering the fact that many of my friends have NO idea where the Mr. Bill character comes from.Oh well ! Even if I did n't have a dog , I 'd probably still like this for the novelty factor : )	1
Purchased this for my English Bulldog . She loved hearing it say `` Oh No '' . But bring a puppy , she tore him up within a few days . I have purchased four of these for her . They last a little while but not much of a match for a bulldog . Definitely a cute toy .	1
Lambchop is by far our dogs ' favorite toy - I ended up buying three so I can be sure to have one when they get a little too dirty . That 's the only drawback - it 's white so it gets filthy relatively quickly . Still , the joy this brings our fluffy friends is well worth it !	1
Bought this toy after reading some hilarious reviews and finding out that Mr Bill shouts & # 34 ; Oh nooooooo & # 34 ; when squeezed . My dog loves it . However , the stitching on Mr Bill 's back came off after my dog 's first play with him and this normally does n't happen with her other plush toys . Not too big of an issue as we can sew it back up .	1
Great toy for dogs , durable , long lasting battery . Had one for about three years , still works , got one for my sister 's dog .	1
We actually keep one on back-up at all times , in order to ensure no lap in coverage , lol ! I have two little Boston 's , and it takes them a good 2-3 months to fully tear apart .	1
My 9 year old Lab loves his Mr Bill and we get a tickle out of hearing the OH NOOOOO ! We remember Mr Bill ( telling our age here ) and this was a great reminder . We have an 8-month old shepherd mix that is scared of the Mr Bill ( which thrills the Lab as he can torment the puppy ) . I bought the puppy the Lambchop and he torments us all with the squeaker but he is happy . These toys have lasted longer with my dogs than any other toys I have bought . Things like a loofa toy do n't last 10 minutes and even the stuffingless toys are torns to shreds in short order . I have had these two over a month now and only had to do minor repair . Though these toys do have stuffing so you have to watch your dogs , only portions of the toy rip easily for access to the stuffing ( like the face ) . I have taught the puppy that if he tears his toy , `` mommy '' will just sew it up with dental floss and then he has to find a new place to tear . He learned quickly and no longer destroys every toy when it arrives ! ( If you do this , do yourself a favor and use the regular unflavored dental floss . I made the mistake of using a mint floss the first time I sewed up Lambchop and the puppy licked the poor lamby until it was one big spitball . ) It turned out that both the puppy and the Lab are enamored with Lambchop and I was about to order two more but when I read the tag I discoverd these are made in China . I am usually very careful about food and toys that are made in China but had neglected to check this item . My vet says you need to be careful - particularly of the dye on toys made in China - and Mr Bill is heavily dyed . Though my dogs have had no ill effects from the toys they have to date I may give it more time before reordering .	1
My dog loves this toy , it is now her favorite also it 's not obnoxiously loud either . I do remember Mr. Bill from Saturday Night live and that 's probably why I enjoy it .	1
He is 5 1/4 pounds so this is the perfect size for him . It has a squeaky which he loves . Seems very durable .	1
My two young Siberian Huskies play with this . My girl claims it as hers and often sleeps with it . It fits her mouth about right , as she is on the small side for Huskies . This is her 2nd teddy bear . The 1st lasted about 1 year being squabbled over , pulled on , licked on , and gnawed . It finally died when she figured out how to open the velcro opening in the back and chewed up the squeaker , the velcro , and other parts of the bear .	1
My 2 yr old standard schnauzer will chew through anything . I 've been searching for a bully stick that will last more than 20 minutes with her , and still have n't found one . For some reason though , she plays with this toy differently . Handles it gingerly and is more interested in playing catch with herself than tugging and tearing . That said , this is the first non-animal-part toy that has lasted more than 5 minutes . It has become her favorite over the past 24 hours , which is 24 times longer than I thought it would last.Update : one eye is missing from the bear , but all the seams appear to be intact and she 's still very engaged . Very impressed with the item , although I 'm sure it would be torn to shreds if it was her choosing .	1
I love the kong . We have agressive chewers and these last a lot longer then anything else . Plus the price is very reasonable considering what local stores sell them for .	1
My dog is very spoiled ans has access to 20++ & # 34 ; babies & # 34 ; ... this Kong Teddy Bear is always on his bed or near on the floor . I put it back in his bin and less that 24 hours later there is the Teddy Bear ! Very soft , strong build quality ( he has used it for over 6 months ; 70lb German Sheppard/Doberman and & # 34 ; plays & # 34 ; with his & # 34 ; babies & # 34 ; ) . I highly recommend this product as a cost-effective toy that , for my dog at least , is a must-have on a daily basis . As I type he is laying with it on his bed !	1
The package says it 's for dogs 20-40 lbs , so I hoped my 14 lb mini-schnauzer would n't rip it apart too fast . The day it arrived , the schnauzer , and her 30 lb Schnoodle `` brother '' played tug-of-war with it til they wore themselves out . Teddy survived - yay ! We 've had it for five days now and Teddy still looks like new and the squeaker is great . My schnauzer has pretty much claimed it as her toy and she loves to make it squeak , she throws it in the air and chases it , and occasionally enjoys a game of tug-of-war with Teddy in the middle . I just wish there was a 'large ' because it 's a pretty small toy for a 20-40 lb dog . It 's just about right for a mini schnauzer , toy poodle , etc.Update : my little bad-ass Schnauzer LOVES this thing . Some people have said their dog ripped open the head for the stuffing . My dog usually destroys things but she really likes to make this squeak . I hear her in the middle of the night playing by herself , making it squeak . This is the first toy she has not destroyed within the first week and she plays with it all the time . Kongs are my new best friend .	1
I 'm glad this toy has no stuffing in it , but for a few dollars more , the Kong Cozie is stuffed firmly and has a squeaker in the middle that lasts and lasts . My puppy has two varieties of the unstuffed Kong animals , one being this frog . They were correct to give you a free extra sqeaker . The toy , without stuffing , is very thin and flimsy , and the squeakers do n't last . So far , the toy has not ripped , though , so I think the quality is decent for 5 bucks ! But my 8 and 9 dollar Kong Cozies last as well and there is no need for extra squeakers .	1
Having a 3 year old beagle that has destroyed toys in 3 minutes or less after receiving them , I 'm always on the lookout for one she will like , and that will last longer than a bullrider does.This toy is one of my beagle 's favorites ! She fell in love with this critter ! She loves the squeaky in its head , and will carry it around in her mouth . We do n't let her have it when she 's home alone , since I do n't want her to get bored and chew her way through to the squeaker , but otherwise , it 's held up wonderfully . We also do n't let her play 'pull ' with it . It comes with a replacement squeaker , which is nice.It 's the perfect size for our beagle , and almost the perfect toy . If the size we received is 'medium ' , I would n't order anything smaller for any dog except a Chihuahua . I hope to find some more !	1
Glad to see that so many others have found these to be great toys . These toys are among the best plush dog toys out there , and we 've tried several . I do n't think any are truly `` indestructible '' since there 's always a dog somewhere that will defy that claim , but these are well made and worth buying for the majority of dogs . Just be *sure* to buy the size that suits your dog ; do n't buy one too small that can be swallowed easily ! Dr. Noys ' toys are great in that they always include an extra squeaker in the pack , and the toy squeaker is easily replaceable in its hidden velcro pouch . ( Squeakers are not indestructible ; that 's why they include an extra . But the advantage here is that they are very secure , and ca n't be eaten . ) You can even buy separate packages of squeakers if your dog is tough on plush toys . Or you can remove the squeaker if it drives you crazy ! ; - ) Pay attention to the sizes listed : extra-small is really small , best for only the tiniest toy breeds or for small puppies . Medium will work for most dogs , but if your dog is a shredder , loves to destroy plush toys , only get the large sizes . If you have certain breeds , like Staffordshire terriers and bull dogs , then perhaps another toy would be a wiser choice . You know your dog.So if you 're tired of buying so-called `` dog toys '' that are really glorified baby toys and are easily destroyed , try these . Ours have lasted for two years with hard play , only replacing the squeakers . Even better , they 're usually included in the Amazon 4-for-3 promotion , so you can get one free if you buy four ! That way you can test out different designs , or save one for later . Highly recommended !	1
we have 5 of these . one of our bostons loves it , but then he uses as a sucking toy . instead of a teddy bear , it is more of a tiddy bear for him . really all the dog like them . i throw them in the wash every couple of weeks , but they have held up longer than some of the othe toys .	1
Our Apollo ca n't live without his Teddy ! I 've never had a dog so attached to his toy . He mangles it , runs with it and sleeps with it . Absolutely in love with it . It has held up better than any of his other toys ... I just wish Amazon would bring back the large version of this toy . I bought 2 mediums in case his beloved large fails . This dog toy is the best and has taken 2 years of 95 lb . black Lab punishment ... now that is a true test ! !	1
I got this for my 6 months old puppy and she liked it . A few months later , she loved it . A few times , when Mr. Teddy was downstairs and Al knew we were going upstairs to take a nap , she would carry Mr. Teddy all the way to the bed and rest her paw and muzzle on it . I even bring it when we go on trips .	1
Smaller than I expected , but the dogs like this toy . My dogs do n't try to destroy toys , they just play hard with them ... .and this has stood up to their playing .	1
Purchased for a mini shih-tzu for Christmas . This teddy bear is her absolute favorite toy . Not only does she play with it by squeaking it and carrying it around , she takes it to bed with her at night . She holds her bear under her paws . Provides security for her .	1
My first dog loved this toy as soon as I took it out of the box . He is n't an aggressive chewer , so I do n't have to worry about the toy being ripped apart . He likes to throw it around and chew on it . ** UPDATE ** After 6 months , the paws and ears have been chewed off , but overall still a useable toy . I got a second dog in September , and the two dogs tug on this and love it still .	1
This I would have to say is my puppies favorite toy . She loves it and plays the it all the time . Recommend for any one that has small dogs .	1
Everyone in my home has a teddy . This one was bought for Lucy my puppy . She is really hard on her toys . This has lasted a year and counting . Sturdy toy . Easy to spot or hand wash .	1
wow my 2 dogs love this , brought 2 of them and very please , was please with shipment and will order again and would recommend this dog toy for any dogs .	1
I purchased this item mid January 2012 . Its mid July now 2012 & the teddy has lasted so far with no issues . This is my dogs absolute favorite toy & she plays with it daily . It can be her chew buddy for hours on end & the squeaky noise just thrills her to no end . She has several other toys but this one is her first love . I was about to purchase another one right now as backup for when this one goes out , when I realized that I had not reviewed this & given it the credit it deserves . 5 STARS all day long .	1
My dog destroys every toy he gets in his mouth . This one actually lasted longer than most . He still has fun with it , although it now has no face and most of it is pulled to pieces .	1
3 and 4 pound puppies like this size for fetching and squeaking and attempted dismemberment ( no limbs lost yet ) . Cute .	1
My miniature pinscher Bella has this little bear and a little duck . Both of them she 's had since she was a baby , 9 months ago and both of them are still in great condition . They last a long time ! She has torn up many toys in the past but these have held up with no problem at all ! They are definitely two of her favorite toys ! They are very small though , do n't buy them if you have a larger dog at all , I think they are just best for toy breed dogs , Bella is 6 pounds .	1
My husband & I have 3 wonderful pups/dogs that LOVE to play with stuffed animals . The problem is that they usually destroy them quickly , as they really enjoy playing with their stuffed toys together - with one pulling a leg & another pulling a arm , and they are also known to chew on them until they get to the insides - where they then work on spreading the filling all over our house.Because of this we decided not to get them anymore plush toys . But then I read the description for Dr. Noys Teddy Bear & decided to give it a try . My `` babies '' have been playing with it for almost a month now and it 's still in pretty good condition - it 's nearly indestructable ! ( This is a record for us , as most stuffed animals are completely destroyed in an hour or less ! ) The stitching is done extrememly well - with the only part getting chewed open being the nose . But one of the best things is that there 's only a tiny bit of stuffing in there - so even when they got the nose off , there was just one little blob of filling to pick up - and they can still play with it ! Another plus is how easy it is to replace the squeaker . We have n't had to do it yet , but I checked it out - and it really is amazingly easy ! And it comes with an extra squaker too ! Overall , I would HIGHLY recommend Dr. Noys Plush Teddy Bear to all pet owners - it 's well made , nearly indestructable and our dogs LOVE it !	1
My puppy loves the little bear . I took the squeaker out because he already had a squeak toy . It is very small , and at first he did n't seem to like it , but it because his `` in-crate '' toy . He loves picking it up in his mouth and moving it around his crate . Now he loves it so much that he tries to sneak it out to toss it around and play .	1
My little dog likes these toys and I like the fact they have no stuffing . They provide an extra squeaker but she will quickly kill both the squeakers and then just drag the little bear around with her . This is her second one of this same toy because she liked the first one so well that it eventually just started to fall apart . It did last for quite a while though as she normally can destroy a toy in a day . She just kept looking for the stuff on this one which was funny because there is none .	1
My Jack Russell Terrier puppy loves this toy . He has tried his best to `` kill '' it , to no avail . Dr. Noy 's toys are almost indestructable . I like the fact that there are no pieces to break lose or come off this toy which could be dangerous to a puppy who likes to put everything into his mouth.This is one great toy , at a reasonable cost , which has provided my puppy with hours of amusement and exercise . I highly recommend this toy .	1
Although missing an ear ( was in the way of getting to the squeaker ) , this toy is still around and pretty much intact after a few weeks . My dog carries it around with her , rotating it with a few of her others as the favorite of the day .	1
I 've had the Dr. Noys teddy bear in the medium size for almost 6 months , purchased for my 30 lb sheltie girl . Our dog is not a `` sit down and try to rip apart '' kind of dog , but she does love to play tug-o-war ! I usually grip the head while she grabs onto either the squeaking body or one of the limbs , and she hops and pulls and shakes and play-growls until she gets too thirsty to continue . Hubby and I also play keep-away with the bear , tossing it back and forth so she 'll run between us for some exercise ( she 's not much of a retriever ) . Sometimes she 'll pick up the bear and bring it over to me to let me know it 's time to play , but otherwise she really does n't play with the bear on her own . Not the fault of the bear , it 's just the way my sheltie is , and I hope it gives you a better idea of how this bear might hold up with your dog.This bear came with a free replacement squeaker , which I placed inside the fleece bag that contains the other squeaker , for extra squeaking fun . Probably because of the extra protection the fleece gives , both squeakers have survived my little girl 's needle sharp teeth . The fleece thing inside the bear also gives it bulk , without that messy stuffing that dogs so love to pull out . I could hear and feel stitches pop on occasion while playing tug-o-war , but this toy really has held up well compared to other plush dog toys . For 5 months , this bear looked perfect , other than the slobber on it . Our bear has about three sizeable holes and is missing a bit of fur on its chest , which all happened in the last month , but we still use it because there 's no stuffing in the bear . I 'm currently looking for another Dr. Noys toy as a replacement , when that teddy bear goes to tug-o-war heaven.In addition to being very sturdy , this bear is super cute . I have a photo of the Dr. Noys teddy bear in the arms of my sheltie who was laying down , and it 's a photo I 'll cherish forever . **UPDATE** We 've purchased our 2nd Dr. Noys teddy bear in medium size . I tried buying regular stuffed animals , the kind intended for kids , at second hand stores but they all got pulled apart . We now have 2 shelties and they 've been plucking at this Kong teddy bear 's nose for a week ( they really like that fleecy material ) and this bear is holding up like a champ .	1
I bought the Kong green frog for my dog at Christmas . Although she has tons of toys , She always picks up the frog when she wants to play . That is why I bought this one for her birthday . It does not have a lot of stuffing , and I think she likes that .	1
I have two dogs , one big and one small ... they both love this toy . Best of all , it 's extremely durable . Normally with squeaky toys I have to monitor their play with them because if I do n't then I come back in the room three minutes later and they have it all torn apart , stuffing all over the room and have proudly destroyed the squeaker . This one we 've had for a couple weeks now , it 's in their toy basket that they always have access to , they play with it pretty much daily and they 've yet to destroy it . Fantastic deal on this .	1
Lulu 's a small rat terrier mix . She needs a tiny toy and this is perfect ! We keep a stack of them !	1
My dog usually has the squeaker ripped out in a day and he has had this Teddy for months and it is still living-minus an ear but still ok . I plan to only buy Kong toys .	1
Very good quality item . My dog is still playing with it a month later ! Good value and highly recommend A+	1
This was a great purchase ! And we got our extra squeaker ! We have a Chocolate Lab & a Black Lab-Blue Healer mix and they love these . I thought they might be a little small , our dogs are 69 & 54 pounds and they have a great time tossing this in the air , running around squeaking a d having a great time .	1
He carried it everywhere for weeks ! As he got older and his teeth and jaws got stronger , poor little bear eventually went to toy heaven , but it was a terrific toy for a little puppy . So soft and cute , too .	1
I have a Jack Russell Terrier that is a chew-maniac . I bought this bear hoping it would last a bit longer than most , based on good things I have heard about the Kong brand . It 's been about a month and a half now , and he has ripped out the pouch for the replaceable squeaker ( the squeaker itself was the 1st thing to go- in the first week ) , but the squeaker in the bear 's head is still there . Aside from that , the rest of the bear is fully intact . My pup treats it with care , not biting as hard as usual when playing tug of war . He also plays fetch with it , but surprisingly does not chew it . I have seen him licking it and carrying it around though . When I get home from work , he often greets me at the door with a toy already in his mouth , and this bear is definitely one of his favorites .	1
Really cute ... makes a nice toy for a puppy who is perhaps missing his siblings ... Well made and so soft ... I highly recommend ...	1
This toy is advertised as being indestructible . My significant other says , `` Time will tell . '' But I say , after watching my five-pound Xoloitzcuintle ( Mexican hairless ) go nuts with this toy , that I think the only problem will be when the toy needs to be washed and line-dried . I think my dog will be depressed until he gets his little '' victim '' back again.Squeak , squeak , squeak . My dog likes the second squeaker SO MUCH ( it goes inside the toy 's body , with industrial-type velcro to seal it in ) , that when I took outthe squeaker , my `` Mi-T '' dog went nutso , trying to find the darned thing . I mean , he really , really , REALLY wanted that squeaker -- -- bad ! I think he would havespent hours chewing on the squeaker itself , if I had let him have his way.I love that this toy is soft , oh-so soft . And it is significantly light-weight ( no stuffing ) . It is PERFECT . I highly recommend this toy for small and larger dogs , too . Buy onetoday , if you have a dog that loves toys . Just be prepared for non-stop squeaking . You can always take out the second squeaker and hide it . Good luck with that.UPDATE : It took him months and months of daily chewing , but my little dog finally chewed the end off the bear 's nose . Sigh . I have recommended this toy to lots of dog-owning friends . It 's a great toy !	1
This stuffed frog is for & # 34 ; small & # 34 ; dogs , and I mean small . It is very small , and my dog is 12 lbs , and she loves it . She loves tiny toys . I estimate this toy is best for mini-pets like Chihuahua or small ( under 10 lbs ) . I did n't actually see this one from Amazon because I ordered it for my best friend 's new puppy who live in CA . I saw this at Petsmart and loved it . It is very cute , and from memory , it is about 3+ inches tall . The fur is soft , and I believe it also has a squeak in it .	1
Dog loved the KONG Teddy Bear Toy , however , now for long . Though she got it just to tear up . Would buy more of KONG products .	1
At least this toy is sturdy for a dog that loves to chew . However , it is very small . About the size of a field mouse . I would only recommend it for very small dogs or puppies . If your dog is more that 8-10lbs . I would get a larger one as it could potentially be a choking hazard .	1
These are very durable , but are tiny ! We use them for our toy size dog . Great squeaker though and they love them ! Would definitely recommend for a chihua or any smaller dog !	1
My pug loves this little toy . He does n't get it to squeak , but he plays with it alot . Good toy !	1
I have a little dog that is 10 pounds and she just loves this toy . It 's the perfect size to fit in her mouth and she carries it everywhere .	1
The dogs play with this for hours and love the way it squeaks . I always keep a few extra on hand .	1
Awesome toy ! Stuffingless and my pit bull chews up everything but this toy has seemed to withstand the times of his chewing	1
I bought a ton of these . My dogs love them . I go through tons of squeakers a day and Justin Beaver still holds up .	1
This little beaver is really more on a par size-wise with the kong & # 34 ; extra small & # 34 ; dog toys than their & # 34 ; small & # 34 ; toys . The body of the toy is only a couple inches long plus an additional couple inches for the unstuffed tail . It 's great for small breeds , like shih tzus but I would hesitate to give this little thing to bigger dogs as I would be afraid they could shallow it . Just like with other Kong toys , the back is sealed with Velcro to replace the squeaker if need be and an extra squeaker is included . All in all it 's a good toy and my dog does play with it ( although it 's definitely not on her short list of favorites ) but be prepared that this is a tiny tiny toy.Just a note - the pictures show two different toys . I received the one with the dark , flat tail not the one with the fluffy lighter tail . I ca n't imagine that matters to anyone all that much but I just wanted to let you know which one I received .	1
My dog loves this little toy . I thought it would be destroyed in a matter of minutes because of its size but I was wrong . He 's had it for quite a while and it 's been through the washer at least 3 times and it still looks new . I recommend this .	1
Oh she adores all her pets but the beaver even it is so small the adores and tries to hide this one and bury it in her bed so no one sees it to take it away from her . Oh this is so cute being so small ( The dukies are cute too - but ) ; she loves the beaver even more ( maybe because of the tail ? Thanks so much KONG for this one . Again NOT FOR A LARGE DOG ( TOO SMALL ) My dog only 4lbs 5oz .	1
These toys are among the best plush dog toys out there , and we 've tried several . I do n't think any are truly `` indestructible '' since there 's always a dog somewhere that will defy that claim , but these are well made and worth buying for the majority of dogs . Just be *sure* to buy the size that suits your dog ; do n't buy one too small that can be swallowed easily ! Dr. Noys ' toys are great in that they always include an extra squeaker in the pack , and the toy squeaker is easily replaceable in its hidden velcro pouch . ( Squeakers are not indestructible ; that 's why they include an extra . But the advantage here is that they are very secure , and ca n't be eaten . ) You can even buy separate packages of squeakers if your dog is tough on plush toys . Or you can remove the squeaker if it drives you crazy ! ; - ) In the larger sizes you can replace the squeaker with a tennis ball for active dogs.Pay attention to the sizes listed : extra-small is really small , best for only the tiniest toy breeds or for small puppies . Medium will work for most dogs , but if your dog is a shredder , loves to destroy plush toys , only get the large sizes . If you have certain breeds , like Staffordshire terriers and bull dogs , then perhaps another toy would be a wiser choice . You know your dog.So if you 're tired of buying so-called `` dog toys '' that are really glorified baby toys and easily destroyed , try these . Ours have lasted for two years with hard play , only replacing the squeakers . Even better , they 're usually included in the Amazon 4-for-3 promotion , so you can get one free if you buy four ( smaller sizes ) ! That way you can test out different designs , or save one for later . Highly recommended !	1
As soon as I opened the Amazon box , Harri was right there , jumping up and grabbing the toy in her mouth and tearing off like a dog on fire . She seems to like the visual texture the dye-job provides , along with the actual texture of the fur . I got her the large dog toy , wich seems to be just the right size for her . She 's a 65 lb . Coonhound , which is not what I would consider to be a large dog , for those of you wondering about which size to get . So far , it seems to be a sturdy toy , but it has yet to be tested by a good game of tug-of-war between Harri and her sister , Sally . It has held up very well to a lot of other plush toys , and I 've found that I 've had good luck with Dr. Noys in the past , so I 'm more likely to take a chance on Dr. Noys compared to other plush toys .	1
Given to our 6 month old puppy when he was 14 weeks old , this toy remains one of his favorites . It is soft and cuddly yet can get tossed around for fun and takes the beating !	1
This toy is very little ... ... ... .but so is my miniature poodle puppy . She loves this toy . I have machine washed it once , and it came out of washer in good shape .	1
A plush toy that my Bassets Hounds love - it squeeks and is well made so it will last long than most plus toys .	1
I am a fan of Kong because they are durable and cute . My dogs love them because the toys are strong and survive their games of keep-away .	1
Dog liked this one . Enough to play with it lovingly until it was just a shred of brown cloth and fur . He chewed through the body right away to get at the squeaker , but continued chewing long after the squeaker was removed . Did not contain any stuffing for me to remove , and surprisingly the tail stayed on for the whole ride , even after being used frequently as a tug toy.It lasted about 1 month in good condition ( not counting the whole where the squeaker was removed from ) and lasted in ok condition for another 4 months . I still have it and occasionally give it since dog seems to like killing it just as much as day one.It is very small . fits nicely in the palm of my hand . Dog is 10 lbs , and it was perfect for him , but playing chase the beaver was sometimes a nail biting affair . Dog 's biting , my nails .	1
Love all these toys that are made for small puppies ! They really enjoy playing with them and last really well ! Amazon has the best prices on all dog toys ! Fast shipping and quality merchandise ! They each come with an extra squeaker in case the original squeaker gets a hole in it ! Just love Amazon !	1
Really neat toy for a small dog . My Maltese really loves it . It comes with a replacement squeaky which came in handy when my friends cocker killed the first one .	1
My dachsunds love this toy . It is one of their favorite . It 's small but this seems to appeal tho them .	1
This is really tiny , and although it came with 2 squeaker inserts , neither one worked . That said , my little dog loves chasing and & # 34 ; killing & # 34 ; this toy . So I squeak another toy , throw this one , and he attacks it with gusto . Good enough .	1
My little Yorkie Zoe just loves these little dog squeakers . She will not play with anything larger than these and being able to refill this toy is a plus ... .They have become very hard to find in the stores , so I was very happy to find them on Amazon ! !	1
In her review of Frosty Dog , Chantal Ritz says that she does n't think that any dog toy is `` truly 'indestructable . ' '' I agree . There 's not a dog toy made that can withstand the chewing of a particularly determined mutt . So the only really fair tests for a dog toy are whether your dog likes it ; whether it 's safe ; and whether it holds up reasonably well when subjected to day-to-day gnawing ? With those tests in mind , the `` Dynamic Duo , '' ( a male Westie and female Scotty ) give Frosty Dog four stars . They are currently trying to dismember their second . The first one lasted a year , the last six months of which were spent with two legs and no nose . And they would still be playing with it , except that I got tired of looking at the poor bedraggled thing . By the way , I think that the `` large '' FD is probably the right size for all , but the very smallest , dogs . The Dynamic Duo only weigh in at 20 pounds each , but the `` large '' FD suits them fine .	1
My dog loves this toy . He 's a 65 lb border collie mix ... ..it even comes with an extra squeaker . The belly has a velcro opening for speaker replacement . It 's perfect to have him carry to keep his mouth busy and his brain focused . It washes perfectly ( I removed squeaker first ) . It 's a good toy .	1
This thing is so cute and perfect for a small dog the only thing that throws me with this is from a distance it looks like dog poo . When i see it i usually have to do a double take . He loves it , he will chew on the body and i pull the tail and tug with it . Great lil toy for him	1
Small dogs love them and and seem to use it as a binkey or comfort toy my little one carries it around all the time - sqeeker dies quickly with chewers	1
I bought this for my brother 's chihuahua and she loves it to death ! It seems to last quite awhile for a smaller dog and she drags it everywhere !	1
My shih tzu puppy loves this tiny kong toy . He 's able to squeak it easily and gets great joy out of that . Larger squeaker toys are difficult for him to squeak . This is perfect for small puppies who are teething and still have their baby teeth . I also have the tiny frog like this one . If your small dog or puppy has a hard time making his or her toys squeak they will love this . It also comes with a replacement squeaker and you can remove the squeaker easily through the velcro opening to wash the toy . The velcro seals tightly.I see some other reviewers dogs have destroyed this toy , it is tiny so keep that in mind before ordering . It definitely is a small dog toy ( slightly smaller than the length of your hand when you include the flat tail ) .	1
It is a really small toy . Not appropriate for anything over 15 pounds . My mini dachsie loved the squeezing sound . She is a very enduring chewer and destroyed it within a little bit but she really liked playing with it . If you have a chewer on your hands , this toy will be fun but not everlasting , but in the end , which toy actually is ?	1
But my puppies love them . Perfect size for a pomeranian puppy . My two ca n't get the squeakers squeaking on any other plush toys . I bought all of the Kong teenie weenies and my puppies squeak them and fight over them all day . Good for the dogs & # 8230 ; not so much for the humans in the house .	1
The picture was different from the item we received but we like what we received better . Squeeker still works and still not torn up , gave to the dogs as a Christmas gift ... that is pretty good ! ! !	1
i bought this for a sibling 's doggie , and received emails all a long as it was in back order ; good communication about this purchase , and real cute , had to hide from my doggie to get it where it was supposed to go . . i 'm not sure how it was as i have n't mailed it yet as my family did n't make it here , but it looks cute and sweet . good experience none the less .	1
My dog loves it so much she destroyed it within two weeks . Wait for it to go on sale if you 're planning to get for your husky or lab . They will tear it apart !	1
Our Yorkie absolutely will not share when it comes to the KONG bever . It has well secured squeak ball within that allows for hours of shaking and tugging . It launders beautifully and a second one is sure to be on the order list when this one wears out . KONG is a brand name that I trust and always find satisfaction in the product .	1
this is a great toy for any dog that likes small toys . my dog loves this toy so much and has played with it so much that it now looks like a sad mouse not a beaver . its a cute toy with an extra squeaker you cant beat that .	1
I must 've bought a dozen different toys for my mini dachshund puppy ... and for some reason this one is her favorite . I was hesitant to buy it seeing as other toys had higher rated reviews , but I am really glad I got this one .	1
Have had this with a new puppy for over 6months now and it 's still going strong . No stuffing to rip out , comes with an extra squeaker . Have not had to use extra squeaker yet . Perfect for small dogs and puppies .	1
This is n't a squirrel ? Its a beaver ... .And my little man sure does love it ! ! ! They are cheaper at petsmart and are usually on sale for around 3 bucks ... same with the duck and frog ect ...	1
I like that you can remove the squeaker out of this plush toy and wash it . My Shih Tzu is not very interested in the plush toys , so I gave it to a friend with a female Chihuahua that likes to 'baby ' plush toys . The Chihuahua carries this little beaver around and really enjoys it .	1
We must use the past tense since he was destroyed by Buster Brownie . We almost cried at his destruction , but he was a guest .	1
Quality squeaky toy of all times ! Even for a midsize Spaniel it is dearly cherished . Well made and comes with extra squeakers but not needed as yet after a jillion squeaks . Would buy same thing again .	1
I 'd previously had a Dr. Noys medium-size teddy bear to play tug-o-war with my 30 lb knee-high sheltie , and after 6 months of tug-o-war , it looked like it had open-heart surgery . Held up quite well ( looked perfect for the first 5 months ) , so I decided to get another Dr. Noys toy for my little girl , as she loves stuffed toys.I do n't use this medium-size Frosty Dog for tug-o-war , as it 's a bit too small , she ends up accidentally biting my fingers when she tries to get a better grip on the toy ( did n't have that problem with the medium size teddy bear ) .So instead , my husband and I play keep-away with the Frosty Dog , tossing it back and forth so she 'll run between us for some exercise ( she 's not much of a retriever ) . When we throw it short so she has a chance to get the toy , she pounces on it and prances around with it in her mouth like it 's the best thing ever . She 'll also run to her toy box and select this toy when my husband is laying on the floor doing back exercises , and she 'll plop the Frosty Dog on his chest as a not-so-subtle way of saying `` Since you 're down here at my level , play with me ! '' . Sometimes when our sheltie is super happy , she 'll pick the Frosty Dog up and hold it in her mouth for a minute , squeaking the toy every couple seconds , just for the joy of it . The squeaker has held up great over 2 months of her joyful squeaking . She simply loves this toy.My dog is not a determined toy destroyer , thankfully . But , based on my experience with my other Dr. Noys teddy bear toy , their toys are built to be far superior to other plush toys . **UPDATE** September 13th , 2008 : Last week , I had to take this toy away because Zoey had managed to pluck open the side of the Frosty Dog 's face , exposing the irresistible stuffing inside . Curses ! If I had sewing skills , I 'd take upholstery thread ( tough stuff ! ) and sew it back up . But , I do n't have sewing skills . Double curses ! I 'm searching for a new toy . *sigh* Still , the Frosty Dog lasted over 4 months , that 's not too bad .	1
This is one of the favorite toys of our dogs . It is small , the squeaker can be replaced or removed , and they are able to just toss it anywhere they want .	1
My dog loves this little toy . She 's not a large dog , so the little toys are not intimating and easy for her to carry in her mouth .	1
My smaller girl dog like this one . She runs around the house with it . Its really quite durable . I was surprised as it is so small .	1
Our french bulldog will tear anything up in a day . I read somewhere that this specific model seems to be the strongest . I have n't tried other Dr. Noys toys , but I got ta say the little guy loves it . We got it for him 3 months ago and he has not tore it ! His toys rarely last , but this one is still intact .	1
I hope that this toy gives these poor animals a little bit of pleasure while waiting for their forever homes	1
We got this as a holiday present for my friend 's dog , a Shih Tzu . It was adequate for him as this thing is SMALL . A lot smaller than I thought it would be.This little guy lasted a long time though , but the little shih tzu eventually shaved his beaver .	1
My 12 lb Chihuahua/Rat Terrier mix will chew through anything . This toy has lasted a record 3 months . He pulled out the squeaker and the stuffing early on but this toy is well sewn and is still holding together despite his rough play . We just bought a replacement for when this one finally comes apart .	1
He loves it ! My newly adopted long hair chi ... ... ... ... .first time he has had a squeaky toy . and he 's loving every minute of it ... .it 's much smaller than I expected , but works perfectly for my little man .	1
I was happily surprised because for the firs time my 4.2 lb chihuameranian got her jaws and claws on a 4 lb sized dog toy instead of larger sized stuffed animals . She went to town on this beaver dog squeak toy and a squeak duckie . Now if you are a buyer that expects plush materials in a squeak to for 3 or 4 buck you better rethink and open your wallet more . I just wondered how long this would last because I knew it would be hours or days of enjoyment before the kill . She had a blast squeaking this thing and shaking it like nuts for about a day before she fixated on getting the squeak out . She could n't open the velcro so so she made her own hole to get the squaker out , as it is thin material , to destroy the squeak gnawing off the whistle . She went though both squeakers in 2 days but still loves to haul the carcass around for me to throw for her . She must still love it because she 's got a boatload of other toys and she still gets this to throw and catch . Yes , both the beaver and duck are empty carcasses but she still carries em around . I got what I paid for and expected and am happy .	1
AGAIN THIS LITTLE TOY ALSO FASCINATES MY CHIHUAHUA.. SHE KEEPS TRYING TO MAKE IT SQUEAK..SO CUTE TO WATCH . i CALL IT `` ' YOUR BABY `` & THROW IT . SHE CHASES & BRINGS IT BACK TO ME.. AWWWW .	1
I got this for my 10 week old miniature dachshund puppy . She loved it , and unlike a lot of toys , she was able to make it squeak very easily . The body of the toy ( minus tail ) is about the size of a small mouse ( real ) , so you would n't want to get this for a big dog . It came with an extra squeaky , which I loved . Unfortunately , our larger , chewing machine dog got a hold of it and tore it , so the old squeaky is broken and the new one wo n't stay in . I might have to order another one , it was such a good toy for the puppy !	1
This toy is holding up very well . All the Kong toys seem to last . My dogs , jack russell terriers , like the small size .	1
The little dogs love this toy , and I have to keep it away from the big dogs because it would n't last long with them . But the small dogs like to carry it around , chew on it , and hide it from the bigger ones . Definitely for non-aggressive chewers but my dogs do love it .	1
My little morkie loves her need toy ! She got it for Christmas and plays with it a lot . Perfect for a little dog like her ( 4lbs )	1
Held up well for a teacup poodle	1
I got this for my 2.5 lb Yorkie puppy . She absolutely loves playing with it . The low stuffing and small size are perfect for her tiny mouth . She is able to carry it easily in her mouth and is able to make it squeak on her own . Well made toy for teacup or small size breed dogs . i would highly recommend .	1
Pup has been on this for about a month..starting to see slight improvement in the movement..do n't expect a overnight improvement in any of these products..need to look for the long term ..will update as time goes on	1
Already knew that the product was working for the dogs who are 12 and 9 years of age , but at $ 14.oo a bottle in WalMart I was looking for a better deal and I found it ! Kudos to you ... you beat WalMart !	1
My only complaint is that for a 40-lb dog ( and below ) you have to cut the pills in half . And they crumble more than cut . Use a pill cutter for better results . Directions : one dose each morning and evening .	1
Really great product for dog joint health . I recommend it to anyone who has a pet that has poor joints .	1
These are great for my dog with serious arthritis . It is not a miracle and will not make your 14 year old dog jump like a puppy . However , It does work about as well as prescription drugs . I have tried Meloxicam and Deramaxx . I found these supplements provide just as good a result without the risk of liver and stomach problems.I would strongly recommend trying this product . Your dog will love them like treats . They are as good as some prescription items but do n't expect a miracle .	1
My Golden has to use a couple of different hip and joint medications , this is one of the ones that she is on . They definitely do the job for her she runs around playing in the snow with no problems . I can tell the difference if I have not given them to her , she will limp around and has problems getting on and off the couch .	1
I have been giving my lab mixed breed dog Glucosamine for the last several years -- on advice of a vet . Since my husband and mother swear that the people version help their arthritis and aches and pains , I figure why not the dog ! He will be 13 years old in two months and people ca n't believe he 's that old -- still jumps and runs around like a puppy . I will continue to give him these tablets .	1
Has made a big difference in how our 7 year Golden Retriever is able to play and get around . Definitely a good buy and we will be buying more .	1
I gave this to my 7-year-old Shar-Pei mix because he was walking funny from time to time . So I thought he might need some type of supplement to strengthen his hip and joint.It must have worked because at the moment he is wrestling with a puppy , and he has a huge grin on his face !	1
We have several animals and flea control gets expensive . This product was exactly identical to what I normallly get from the vet and easier as it comes to me .	1
I have always used Advantage on my cats & dogs . My 2 cats have been trying to get outside all the time this year every time we open a door . So they have gotten fleas from sneaking outside . I do not see them scratching anymore & they are still sneaking outside when they can ! ! !	1
... between this product and Advantix , depending upon which product is priced less expensive at the time . That 's because both work well at fighting fleas for approximately 3 1/2 weeks . I do n't know whether it 's because I have a dog and four cats , but we have to reapply flea meds every month , so claims that this product breaks the cycle completely either is n't accurate , or . . . well , I ca n't fathom why it would n't break the cycle completely . We apply the product on all cats and our dog simultaneously , so you 'd think that the fleas would die off permanently . Still , it does seem to kill the adults very quickly , as any scratching that took place prior to application immediately stopped after application .	1
This year I decided to go cheap and purchase a less expensive brand of flea control ... well I certainly paid for it with a nice infestation of fleas , even on my inside cat ! I went back to this more expensive ( but certainly more reliable ) brand and the fleas have completely gone . I noticed with the cheaper brands they have a lot of liquid and it takes forever for the big greasy spot on the back of the cat 's neck to try . How unsightly ! But with this I could n't even tell if I was putting any on them , it was so discreet . I will definitely be sticking with this from now on .	1
i used this in conjunction with a ton of other things to finally rid my poor ferret and cat of fleas . had to use over a period of time but finally kicked in .	1
For similar products , I have to pay double locally . I 've got 2 cats so this means hundreds of dollars a year I will save using this . Advantage is the highest recommended flea treatment in my area . I 'm on evening one and I expect the fleas to drop within a day . If I 'm not happy I 'll edit the post , but it should last for about 4 weeks per treatment .	1
I was debating whether to purchase frontline or advantage for a few days . This was my first time purchasing a product to kill my cats fleas . I ended up choosing advantage for a few reasons . One reason is the price was a little cheaper and was offered with free shipping . The second reason is with Advantage you do not have to shower your cat and wait two days to apply the treatment . Although frontline does kill ticks you might get more for your money but then again my cat does not have a tick problem . The applications were really easy to apply . Instructions are really clear and self explanatory . My poor cat was meowing in distress for days and I would comb him and use flea sprays but the fleas just kept coming . So I use advantage on him and I was just amazed on how quick and well it works . I combed his fur and not one flea was found except for some dead ones . It has been two weeks and my cat has not been meowing . He is enjoying life and sleeping in peace again . I recommend this product to anyone who has a cat with a flea problem . Quick and easy to use .	1
Advantage is an excellent product . I 'll use it for a few months and then use another product that kills fleas AND ticks . I live in a heavily infested tick area , so it 's necessary to use this flea and tick medication . However , this medication is not as effective as Advantage in killing fleas , which is why I alternate the two.Advantage is also less expensive than `` the other medication . ''	1
Fleas were really bad this spring , garlic in her food was n't working . W/i one day she stopped scratching . It 's about one month now , so will treat her again , but the little tormentors have n't started up yet . Great price on Amazon , got it two days later with Prime .	1
I feed several feral cats and bring the fleas inside to my cats . With one treatment , no more scratching cats and no more fleas on my socks .	1
I have used this product both of my cats for a good while now . It works great and fast . My cats are sensitive to a lot of things but neither has any kind of reaction to this product . I will continue to use .	1
Needed some for my cats . The price was great ! I 'll definitely buy again . Keeps down on the population of fleas and makes my cats more comfortable .	1
Safe , effective , and instant . I 've used this and only this on all of my pets and could n't be happier . Never had a single problem , though my cats do seem to enjoy licking it off each other even though it 's supposed to have a bitter taste to discourage that . If you have more than one animal you may want to be wary of this !	1
I have used this products for many years and it has always worked . Will continue to use it until we are all gone.Dinne	1
I remember the days of flea collars and how ineffective they were . This product is like a miracle . My current cat does n't have fleas but my last cats did , and this worked great . Definitely worth the higher price .	1
As strictly related to shipping , it arrived several days late , which causes me concern with a product that should be kept in a controlled environment . Amazon shipping is usually spot-on , but this was not one of those times . Frustrating to wait for something that we needed for our pets . So I suggest ordering ahead of your actual need.We have 2 indoor cats that had what I would call a minor flea problem . The initial dose seemed to do the job . And unlike some treatments I 've used it was well tolerated . No irritation to the skin , etc.We had a recurrence of fleas just over a month later and had to re-apply the product . I know fleas are hard to get rid of completely so I 'm not totally surprised . I was hoping that the first dose would end the problem , seeing as the fleas were n't that bad.I shopped around and Amazon had the best price . So really the only thing bugging me was the mishandling of the shipping .	1
We have tried various flea treatments and this is the only one that does the job for us . Have been using it for years , do n't intend switching ever ... ... ... ..	1
I like this for use on my cats . However , it doesn t last 30 days and I find the need to re apply about every 3 weeks .	1
No fleas so far , so this working as far as I can tell . We 'll see what happens next month . We tried to have our vet give our cats the program shots ; however , the vets insist on a physical for the cats first . This costs us $ 250 every six months for two cats , so this was too expensive for us .	1
I like the new design of the box , but I feel like it takes up more room now . The old package was slimmer and fit in my bag I keep my cat supplies it . But I do think this product will be better than FrontLine .	1
I use Advantage on all my cats every month . The price and time it took to receive it was terrific . The product is really good & I do n't worry about fleas or ticks because of it .	1
Many products are not safe ... like Hartz , and made my cat sick . Advantage works great on all my cats , and they are indoors at night and out playing most of the day . I alternate cats when I use Advantage , and apply it only every 3 weeks to ONE cat at a time in the winter ... . still no fleas ! In the summer I use it every 4 weeks as suggested . My daughter has 8 cats and a dog , and uses only Advantage for flea control . It works better than anything else out there . It 's so nice not to have flea bites all around my ankles , or fleas in my home ! !	1
Product works well but like human drugs , it 's very pricey . When is a generic coming out ? ? It does keep the fleas away , very definitely.I 'm re-posting about a year later . My cat , Kitten Kaboodle , started reacting strongly to this drug so I switched to Frontline , and he 's better with that . And , a generic version of Frontline is out now.Both Advantage and Frontline are excellent at keeping fleas away , not only from the catters but from my home .	1
Advantage works very well on my cats . They tolerate it well , and it gets rid of fleas quickly . I use this every other month on my cats and it controls the fleas very well	1
Advantage is the first flea control for my 3 cats that seems to be effective . We have tried lots of products and this is the bomb . No more fleas on the cats , no more fleas on my ankles , no more fleas period . You 'll need one dose per cat per month . I got the six pack and treat all 3 for 2 months at a time . This stuff is alot more expensive at the pet store . Found it on Amazon and bought it from a place that resells overstock . The box was wrinkled , but the contents were in perfect shape . Paid an excellent price , I think around 34.00 for 6 doses of the up to 9 pound cat mixture , and the shipping was free ! Quit wasting your time with other stuff and simply give it a try .	1
My cats barely seem to notice this treatment and it seams to sting less than other similar treatments I have used . I have found it effective for up to three weeks the first two applications and now after having used it consistently for almost a year I have found that the cats need a new treatment every 5-6 weeks.This Advantage works much better than other products I have tried .	1
Puts Frontline to shame . It killed them initially , but they came back and/or did n't get rid of them completely . Other products worked at first , but more showed up only a couple of weeks later.Advantage started working immediately and has kept them away . The only disadvantage I see is that it does n't kill ticks , but my cats do n't go outdoors so I 'm more worried about fleas . Put it on my cats and it also took care of the fleas on my ferret without having to put any product on her which was another big plus .	1
I usually go to Advantage when the flea season starts ( and it always worked good ) , but Costco had the cat Frontline and I tried that this time ( I figured they were all pretty much the same ) . Boy what a MISTAKE ! ! ! ! My flea population EXPLODED on Frontline ! ! ! I had my 2 cats and 2 dogs on the Frontline , and they were all itching and scratching with fleas . I waited for the month ( literally picking at least 30 fleas off each of my dogs every night by hand to try and help ) , and then went back to my Advantage . The day after applying Advantage , I found 1 flea on my dog ( I have long hair cats , and I can not see the actual fleas on them , but I can on my dogs ) and it was almost dead , it just fell off her ( on Frontline , I went from having about 15 fleas fall off my dogs while bathing them before the application , to almost 100 while they were on it , so they had A LOT of fleas when I applied Advantage ) . My cats are not scratching constantly anymore . In 1 day , this product did what the people at Frontline told me would take up to 6 months for their product to do ! ! Advantage SAVED my animals and house from being COMPLETELY infested with fleas ( gross ) . This stuff is amazing , and I will always use Advantage ! ! !	1
I 'm so happy to see I could buy Advantage through Amazon . I thought I could only buy it through my vet.I 've used Advantage for my previous cat and for my current cat . My previous cat did not like Advantage at all . She 'd try to lick it off . If I put it on her too low , she 'd be able to get at it and her mouth would foam up . Apparently , this was not unusual , since the people at the vet 's told me about the foaming mouth when I reported it to them . They did n't think it was too harmful . To prevent the foaming mouth , make sure to place it where they ca n't get to it , higher up on their head . My current cat does n't seem to mind it so much.Easy to use , and the scent is n't bad compared to other brands . Not too greasy once it 's fully dispersed over the fur . No fleas so far . This is my preferred flea product for my cats .	1
This is the only product that works on my three cats ; Frontline did nothing for them . Amazon 's price is the best anywhere , every time I have purchased it .	1
I have used Advantage flea protection for almost 15 years and only the price has increased over time . We may or may not have fleas , hard to find proof , but if an itchy spot shows up on my arm or leg we give the cats the treatment . Seems to work at least for mild flea issues .	1
I have used Advantage on my cats for years . I could only get the 4-tube package at my vet and it was rather expensive . Being able to get the 6 pack and at a price less than what I pay for the 4 pack is amazing to me . I have used this product for over 13 yrs . It keeps the fleas at bay . I would n't use any other product .	1
I like Advantage as it does n't bother my cats when I put it on , and it is very effective . I used Frontline before and they acted like I was putting acid on them . This is gentle and it works ! ! !	1
I buy the capsules for flea controle for my other cats , but my & # 34 ; big boy & # 34 ; wou n't eat it on his food or stand still to be given it by force . This is the way he gets his !	1
always trying to stay one step ahead of the summer infest has been my best bet with 22 cats . 22 flealess cats and the guests they invite over . i am the party house .even the guests get a dose so we have no unwanted company . it works .	1
For my cat , the older formula advantage seems to work better than their newest one , and my cat seems to tolerate having it applied a little better , too .	1
I started walking my cats outside at the beginning of summer , so I knew I had to have some flea protection . I had n't had them on any flea prevention for at least 3 years because they were strictly indoors . Prior to that they would go outside on their own and I used frontline . Frontline seemed to stop working after awhile . I switched to revolution , but that is extremely expensive , especially when you have 3 cats . My only reservation about using this product is that it does n't kill ticks , just fleas . Even so , I thought I 'd give it a try because I figured that I would be able to feel a tick on them as they are always climbing all over me and I 'm constantly rubbing them . So far , so good . No fleas or ticks and it does n't stink nearly as much as frontline .	1
Although my cat gets out sometimes , she never has fleas or ticks thanks to Advantage . At one time I used another product that did n't work ; Advantage does . I 'm so glad I have it to use . I know my cat is too . ; - )	1
I also thought it was cute that the picture on the box looks like my cat too -- -no seriously , this product works and I 've never personally had a problem with it on any of my cats . As usual , do be careful what you put on your pet .	1
I switched to this a few years ago when the fleas were unbearable , even with the other medication I was getting from the vet . Within a week of the first dose of Advantage my whole home settled right down and the cats and I were no longer getting any bites . My cats are 16 , 18 , and 24 pounds . ( Yes , the vet and I have gone rounds and rounds with the big boy . ) The 9 pounds and up vial is fine for them . Just one vial , and an upset cat for a few moments for putting stuff on their shoulders , and the fleas are gone.At first I thought there were no more fleas in the neighborhood , but the neighbors pets were still covered in fleas . Apparently when you have a pet , the fleas prefer the animal and will go to it ( treated or not ) for a feast . When the flea medicine works , all the fleas in the home are wiped out too . Vet said I did n't need to waste my money on flea bombs for the house since we have cats . Living in a humid environment ( Oregon where we do n't tan , we rust ) Advantage actually seems to work better and fleas are less likely to develop a tollerance.I have a reminder that tells me to get more medicine every month , and wo n't be without this . Best product for my area.I had heard that some people were buying this in pet stores and inside the packaging and blister seal was another product ( Advantix for large dog ) , but buying through Amazon so far I have never had that happen . I still check each tube before administering the medicine though . I do n't know if I have just been lucky , because our Dentist 's receptionist said she just went through this when she bought the product at the pet store . I still strongly recommend this product though . Just check everything to be sure .	1
Fleas ! We hates them ! Nasty little bitey bugs.But this stuff kills them- for one application , for an entire month . Easy to use but the little applicator is a teensey bit confusing , do read the instructions.One other `` advantage '' the cats did n't seem to mind it as much as some other prodcts . And- it works .	1
I absolutely love this product . When I first bought my dog she was full of fleas and I was recommended this product to treat her condition . Whithin a day there was no itching or scratching and I saw the fleas dead in her bed , which I washed afterwards . From then on I 've been buying this product and continue to use it on her . I definitely recommend it .	1
this seemed to work fast and well ! pros : descent price , works , fast , and is better than frontline hands down ! ! cons : it gets into their blood stream of something because it makes their breath smell like chemicals , i dont know why.its also a bit drippy .	1
I saw fleas after having been using an oral medication for my dogs -- it seemed to have STOPPED working..threw the kids in the tub ... bathed them - then RAN to PetsMart and bought the Advantage ... .in less than 24 hours my dogs STOPPED scratching and slept the night . I have ordered their next doses from Amazon ... but at the first sign of the fleas I wanted IMMEDIATE action..LOLand per another reviewer I did in fact notice a whiff of `` altered '' breath on one of my ( small ) dogs -- -but it was't awful -- but definitely `` changed ''	1
This ended up working better than the other brand . We purchased front line and it did n't work that well . This one did work great . Immediately , I noticed that our dog minimized scratching . It took about two days for our dog to completely stop scratching . This one was a little cheaper than frontline as well .	1
Bought this online and saved mysef quite a bit of money . This was at least $ 5 more from my vet , and 10 more at the local pet store .	1
We used this for our dogs and did n't have any issues with it not working for fleas . It does n't work for ticks , at least not according to package and what I could tell . I ended up buying flea and tick preventative through our big name savings store because buying in bulk worked well for this product for us . Tick preventative is pretty important for us where we 've got woods behind us and do n't want the dogs bringing ticks into the house .	1
Our outdoor area is suffering through a major flea infestation . Having tried frontline without success , we waited some time before trying Advantage . Worked like a charm .	1
Advantage was the second flea treatment that we used this year . In the past we have used Frontline ( large dog ) , but the batch I got this year did not have an effect at all . My husband had nearly itched his ankles through to the bone , along with the dog and cats . We actually considered dosing his feet to give him some relief ( ! not serious , just joking ! ) , he is very sensitive to flea bites ! We have 1 dog , 7 full time house cats ( currently ) , 2 outdoor cats , and a couple of semi-feral cats that we treat and feed when they are around . Since the dog version of the medication is the same active ingredient as the cat , we buy the large dog and meter it out based on their weight . One of our cats is sensitive to the `` recommended '' dose strength . We have found that if we dose based on how many mL should be administered per pound , we save even more ... and of most imporatance , we are not giving a larger dose of chemicals than is needed to achieve the same results ! Relief for the pets was immediate . The same day that we applied the chemical , they stopped scratching as bad . Since the house is all hardwood , no rugs , no carpet , very little cloth of any kind anywhere due to allergies ... with continued cleaning of the house on a daily basis , the population of fleas soon dwindled to almost nothing . Four stars because it is a chemical . I really wish there was an organic alternative that is effective ! We use food grade diatomaceous earth in the house , but only as a dusting before we vaccuum . Otherwise the dust bothers my breathing .	1
great price for a great product . I have 4 dogs so price is a concern and this was a good deal .	1
This is a really , really Great product . It worked great on my Westie . She is very active outdoors , we walk to parks , trails in the woods , and she has no fleas nor ticks ! It did n't surprise me because she had gotten No Fleas Nor Ticks last Summer either.Highly recommend it , could n't recommend it enough for a dog who spends lots of time outdoors .	1
I bought this to split between my three cats and one small dog . They all had fleas after I forgot to treat my dog before I went on a lengthy vacation and one of my cats ended up living outside for two weeks ( escaped while I was on vacation ) . Anyway , I was so worried and upset when I discovered that my pets had fleas . I gave them all flea baths , picked off live fleas , gave them other flea treatments that did n't seem to work ( the store-bought flea drops , for example ) , washed linens , and I still could not get rid of them or even see a dent in the population . That 's when I decided to start hunting online for a solution since taking them all to the vet would be very expensive.I bought the large dog Advantage ( > 55 lbs ) with the intent to divide it amongst my pets . I used all but 0.5 ml of one vial for the first treatment . I have not treated them a second time yet , but they are due very soon . After treatment , the place on their back was not greasy . In fact , by the second day , I could n't even tell they had something put on their backs , and it did n't smell bad . It did not smell AT ALL . On day one , I found quite a few fleas laying around on the bed blanket . They had evidently jumped off the pets . They seemed very confused and slow , but were still alive . I made sure I killed them in case they were only temporarily impaired . By the next day , I could find no evidence of fleas on my pets ... .not even any flea debris ( I guess the pets had groomed themselves to remove it ) . All the pets were extremely thankful for treatment and extra loving after they no longer had fleas pestering them.I 've continued to snuggle with my pets , checking them daily for fleas or signs of them , and monitor the bedding for any evidence of fleas . NOTHING to be seen or found ! I am so happy with the Advantage flea treatment ! I will treat them all again in a few days in order to make sure any new eggs hatching do n't re-infest the pets.I put 1 ml each on a 13 lb rat terrier , 20 lb cat , and 16 lb cat . On my smaller 6 lb cat , I administered 0.5 ml . I certainly wanted to make sure I gave them enough since I think I had a serious flea problem and knew some of the medicine would be rubbed off onto their surroundings . They suffered no ill effects , only benefits , from the Advantage . I benefited greatly by only spending $ 31.50 on Advantage that would treat all of my pets ( 4 ) for 4 months ( plus 2 large pets for another month OR the dog for two more months , who is really the one who needs protection since he goes potty outside ) . I really recommend this product . My pets and I thank you ! In addition , I ordered this product late on a Monday night and had it in my position by Thursday evening . Not bad for using the free shipping option .	1
I have used the Advantage for cats before and it worked great . I was not disappointed in this products for my dog . I would reccommend this to everyone and have .	1
This is the only drop product that is safe for cats too ! ( always check the labels and ingredients before using ! ! ! ) . I use this on alll of my cats and dogs .	1
I decided to buy Bayer Advantage because Frontline Plus was not killing fleas for a whole month , after 2 weeks I noticed fleas on my animals . So when the month was up , I bought Bayer Advantage it works great , for a whole month , killing all fleas , I did have to reapply 2 weeks later because it said so on the box in case of severe infestations to do so . I did so because my animals are allergic to flea bites . I will buy this again . Its a great value here on amazon . Much better than Frontline .	1
This works on our pets well . Sometimes it does n't seem to show the evidence right away , but essentially a good product .	1
With two dogs , we are firm believers in the Bayer Advantage Topical treatments for fleas and lice - and have used this ointment for several years . Our dogs play outdoors , but live indoor with us . This treatment works .	1
Works as a flea killer and a flea preventer . Does n't bother my dogs . I 'm so glad that in today 's economy I do n't need to fork out for the expensive stuff fromt he vet . We live in the Pacific Northwest so fleas are common ... but not for us !	1
I 've been using it for some time , after a crazy flea frenzy on my dog . Originally it took maybe 2 months for all the flees to disappear . And now , 2 years later I never had flea problem again.My dog and my cats a flee free , and I do n't use flee control on my cats ( I guess advantage is this good ) . I do n't even use it every month , 6 pack lasts me all year .	1
I have been using this product for years with good results . There have never been any side-effects or other issues with it . I have heard a product called Comfortis is almost all natural and is supposed to work better than this product , but it is quite expensive and has n't been on the market very long . I will stick with Advantage for the time being .	1
Ditch your Frontline Plus . Advantage does far better in both a wide variety of cats and dogs . Just make sure to choose carefully from the weight categories .	1
My dog 's groomer recommended Advantage for the treatment of fleas . I find it works the best !	1
I usually go to Advantage when the flea season starts ( and it always worked good ) , but Costco had Frontline and I tried that this time ( I figured they were all pretty much the same ) . Boy what a MISTAKE ! ! ! ! My flea population EXPLODED on Frontline ! ! ! I waited for the month ( literally picking at least 30 fleas off each of my dogs every night by hand to try and help ) , and then went back to my Advantage . The day after applying Advantage , I found 1 flea on my dog and it was almost dead , it just fell off her ( on Frontline , I went from having about 15 fleas fall off my dogs while bathing them before the application , to almost 100 while they were on it , so they had A LOT of fleas when I applied Advantage ) . In 1 day , this product did what the people at Frontline told me would take up to 6 months for their product to do ! ! Advantage SAVED my animals and house from being COMPLETELY infested with fleas ( gross ) . This stuff is amazing , and I will always use Advantage ! ! !	1
As a former Veterinary Technician I have considerable experience and knowledge about fleas and their life cycle . However , you do n't have to be a technician to do a google or wikipedia search to learn a little bit before writing an ignorant review . The vast majority of the bad reviews I have read here , are obviously ( to me ) from people who really do not understand where fleas come from and what you have to do to eliminate them.Here 's the thing : 90 % of the flea population that feeds off of your pet are NOT ON THE ANIMAL RIGHT NOW . That 's right , the vast majority of the pests are actually on your floors , carpets , furniture , pet beds and so forth - waiting to hop on Spike and Fluffy when they are hungry . Fleas feed , then jump off the animal , while some more of their family jump on and start feeding in their place . To truly manage the flea problem requires TREATING THE ANIMAL AND THE PREMISES . If you do not treat the premises ( including the yard ) you will never get ahead of the problem . Sevin dust in the yard or some pyrethrin-based spray have been effective for me for many many years.Also , the lack of effectiveness that people think they are seeing is not because the product is not as good , it is because the fleas have become tougher over the years . You just have to attack the problem on all fronts and be as persistent as the pests themselves . Treat the animals and the premises and do n't let up.Now , I am going to save some people a lot of money . The drug in Advantage for Dogs and Advantage for Cats is exactly the same drug ( Imidacloprid ) at the same concentration.If you buy this `` Large Dog '' package , you get four 4ml tubes . If you then empty those into a vial or vials , you can use a syringe ( without needle ) to apply the right dosage to your dogs AND cats . In fact , if your cats are under 10 pounds , you can get 10 cat doses out of each of these vials . That 's a real bargain ! Advantage II is the same , but adds Pyriproxyfen for the full life cycle coverage.Use the following chart and you will be fine.Cats up to 9 pounds - 0.4mlCats 10+ pounds - 0.8mlDogs 11-20 pounds - 1.0mlDogs 21-55 pounds - 2.5mlDogs 55+ pounds - 4.0ml	1
I occasionally buy this item from one of three websites , but chose to buy from Amazon this time since it had the best price . Works as well as the same product purchased elsewhere .	1
In spite of all the newer flea treatments out there , I still like Advantage . It 's always worked for me . I get the large dog version and divide it into 0.8 ml doses for my cats . Saves money and keeps fleas away .	1
This product is soooo much cheaper on Amazon than it is at the stores . It seems to work very well for my dog ( Border Terrier ) .I will continue to use this product .	1
Always preferred Advantage working for my pets . Lost money on other brands . I read that it was safe for my bunny as well . A few itches remained this month.. I am hoping a second application will help .	1
I remembered the days of trying to be cheap and not using any flea control on our dog . It ended with flea trap , flea lamp , flea sprays ... .. so flea control is a must . Advantage is a brand our vet recommended , be sure to apply it every month .	1
This was such a great price , I saved quite a bit of money compared to purchasing this from my vet . Same product , great price !	1
I used to use Frontline with good results , but over time , I noticed that it became less effective -- -and it could , in no way , handle the epidemic flea outbreak we began to experience this summer . The environmental conditions were perfect for an infestation.Since our dog is a giant , long-coated breed ( Shiloh Shepherd ) , you can just imagine how much fun the fleas were having , at the expense of our poor boy . And , since he 's primarily an inside dog , we were also experiencing flea bites . Not a good thing ! I found , that with moderate environmental control , an application of Advantage , and administration of a Capstar tablet ( which I highly recommend ) , that we were able to bring the critters under control.I know , I hate chemicals for my pet , too . But , fleas are not benign -- -they can cause severe flea allergies -- -and those disgusting tapeworms . Plus , your dog ca n't be the happy canine companion he wants to be , if he is constantly digging , ca n't rest , etc . Who knows the long term effects , but right now , I know we are all at peace here , so it is a risk worth taking to improve the quality of his life -- -now.I 'm delighted that you can now buy Advantage online . It is much easier than a trip to the Vet and more cost effective . Yea !	1
I have two Shelties and now live near the Beach where Flea problems tend to be worse . It works well for my dogs and with their long hair , it does not leave a greasy residue like others . I use this along with the Flea Treats Supplement and have not had any problems since .	1
we have to have this in the summer ... ... it got here very quickly . i always get the largest size and divide it between my dogs	1
I have only been using this for a couple months and it appears to work just fine with no side effects . I see the dog scratching a lot less and have n't spotted a flea since we started using it . I simple apply the medicine to the back of the dogs neck after a bath and then let it air dry . As simple as that . Ca n't beat the price online either . I got a six month supply for only $ 17 .	1
I have used Advantage on my dogs for 10 years . We do not have ticks where I live otherwise I 'd switch to Advantix . Since Advantage has worked fine for all my dogs , I see no reason to change.When I got my puppy I was given 2 coupon packs for Frontline . I gave those away because I am not going to switch . I do not want the dogs on different flea meds . So for me once an Advantage user , always and Advantage user .	1
Have used Advantage on my pets for years and we have ZERO flea problems ! Using it every month only when it 's hot out saves money , and it works !	1
I previously used Advantage to take care of my cat 's flea problem , and it worked immediately - but my cat absolutely hated the smell which lingered on her body . She would howl and run off when she saw me approaching with the Advantage vial , and I hate being the villain once a month . So now I 've switched to Program . It 's kind of a pain mashing the tablet and mixing it up into wet catfood . Also , it takes a couple of days to take effect . But - it does work well , and my cat is very happy . I will definitely buy Program tabs again .	1
I have used it since it came out and I do n't have a flea problem . I also like it for the fact like the drops you can have the problem of the side effects .	1
There 's a good article comparing the flea products : [ ... ] The condition of the surrounding and pets all need to be considered before choosing the right product that suits your needs . I have a cat and dog . My dog is a flea magnet and the only product that works for him is Revolution and I love the fact that it 's a heart worm prevention med also . However I put the cat on Program since she is an indoor cat and I feel more comfortable using this on her because my dog licks my cat but not vice versa . I use the Greenie pill pockets to wrap the tablet and has no problem at all enticing her to eat it . So far this combination works perfect for me . Every animal is different . It takes a little trial and error to find the best product for that animal specifically .	1
Moved to Florida and my dog immediately picked up an infestation of fleas ... tons of them . I used this in conjunction with CapstarNovartis Capstar Flea Treatment Blue Tabs for Dogs and Cats and completely control the flea issue . Fleas and bugs are a very common problem in Florida , but with this combination , NO MORE FLEAS ! !	1
This works great . It is a little pricier than some of the products here , but I trust it . It works right away and continues to kill fleas for 24 hours .	1
My dog is MDR1 positive ( common in herding dogs ) so she ca n't have certain medications , including Frontline ( which caused a paralysis of her leg ) . At a recommendation from other MDR1 dog owners I decided to try this and so far there has been no reaction but it has only been two months . I have n't seen any fleas .	1
I used Advantage for years on our outdoor cats and always dreaded the monthly trial of applying it . It was messy , smelled , and neither the cats nor I enjoyed it . I started using Program a couple of months ago and could n't be happier . There 's a lot of liquid in the monthly dose , but I mix it up with some wet food and the cats do n't even know it 's there . They gobble it up and DONE . One cat is 8 lbs and the other about double that , and neither has experienced any negative side effects . Since Program targets flea eggs , we combine it with the Capstar tablets to address the adult fleas , as well . It 's made a huge difference , and I 'm gratified to see the cats relax in comfort rather than constantly scratching and biting .	1
So far it seems to be working . My cat is strictly indoors , so I only had to give him a few doses over a couple months to get rid of what he had . Since then he has been happy and healthy all the way around .	1
This is the best flea product in the world ! I had a cat that was allergic to everything.Flea bath , treatmant , even it being on the other cats and not him.I discovered this product and he had a very happy life ! I use it still on his 2 siblings and the new kitten.It 's wonderful !	1
Easy to use , works well for the two feral cats I care for . Put in food and they ca n't smell it .	1
Worked great , sadly they are not available now and Little City Pets supply of the same stuff does not hold up for my pets as after two months on treatment my pets were covered in fleas .	1
I like this product . I did wish to purchase pills and got the oral liquid . Its all good , just convenient to have pills . Now we are working on getting rid of adult fleas !	1
Program is the safest long lasting flea treatment for pets -- I used to work in a veterinary hospital and I have seen many cats have serious reactions to Advantage and Frontline , which are topical pesticides.Read the inserts for Advantage and Frontline , it says that they are NOT safe for sick animals , young kittens , etc , etc . My cat is allergic to both Frontline and Advantage . Frontline gave him a lump in his neck and Advantage gave him a bald spot where I applied it , and he kept trying to lick the spot.Program is super safe -- you can put it in a dish and mix it with tuna and your cat will eat it right up . You can use it with Capstar ( also super safe , but not long lasting ) to kill live fleas if your cat picks one up . This is the best monthly flea control to keep your cat safe and healthy ! I have used it for almost a decade and I will not use any other product on my cat .	1
No doubt about it , these bags make the responsible but rather unpleasant task of cleaning up after a dog much more tolerable . The typical ultra-thin bag makes the process a little too intimate . These are like wearing thick gloves ...	1
I love these bags . They are the best poop pickup product I have ever used . They are larger than most and really get the job done	1
We have a couple Labradors . these are great for larger dogs ... . I have n't purchased any other poo-bag brands for a couple years now..	1
I first discovered these on Facebook . The lady who manufactures them has a really funny FB page that I recommend you check out . These bags are great . I never go on walks with the dogs without a couple in my pocket ( and often an extra one or two to share with those dog parents who just maybe did n't think about the fact that they should pick up their dog 's business ) .They come in different sizes and a clean one can even double as a portable water bowl for your furry friend.I like that they are biodegradable so I am not adding to the landfill problem.You can use them to put your cat 's litter box deposits in as well .	1
These really do the job while protecting your hand from soiling . Large , easy to use , heavy duty , biodegradable . They work exactly as advertised .	1
Mutt Mitts are the best waste bags I 've found . They are much sturdier ( you wo n't stick your hand through ) and the double layer at the bottom of the mitt means even more strength and protection from unpleasant poop pick up . These are pretty good sized , so it 's easy to tie and fabulous for extra large breeds down to small breeds.The packaging is well designed too . The two holes at top allow you to hang the bags near the door or out of site behind a door or panel . Two thumbtacks easily hold up the package and allow you to tear off bags as you need them . A++ product . If you have dogs , you really should try these baggies !	1
We have an 85-pound dog and use 1,000 bags per year ( 3 per day ) . There is no denying how good these are , as described by other reviewers . It 's the most comfortable way to handle an unpleasant task.What bothers me though is the extra plastic and expense involved with these . Taking into account environmental and economic factors , I prefer to use the smaller and thinner120 Earth Rated Dog Waste Bags , Lavender Scented , 8 Rolls , 120-Count.So what we do is keep both items on hand in a fanny pack . For the biggest or messiest `` jobs '' , we use Mutt Mitts . For typical `` duty '' , the above linked product is very good . That way everyone wins !	1
I think the other bags tend to be flimsy and weird to handle - I would have all sorts of mishaps and end up with dog doo on my hands . Yuck . These are just more substantial ( and I tend to only need one on a walk with two dogs and not two or three of the smaller bags I usually need ) .	1
This quality spray did exactly as advertised . I have a cat , who likes to go outside his litter box , and an active toddler who loves to drop food and color on our light-colored carpet . I used this Bissell Pet Stain and Odor spray as directed , generously spraying a stained area , blotting and covering with a wet rag , and leaving it alone for several hours . I am pleased to say that even some long-time stains that I grown to live with are starting to fade considerably or disappear entirely.As another reviewer pointed out , this product does not work on ink . My toddler colored on a portion of our den carpet with an ink pen , and this spray was not very effective on that area . However , as promised , it did eliminate virtually all of my cat stains throughout the house . I have no complaints and would easily recommend this to others .	1
If you have pets then you should have the BISSELL PET STAIN & ODOR PRE-TREATER SPRAY on hand for those occasional accidents . Even though my Shiba just turned 2-years old and she 's potty trained , she 'll still has accidents . The other day she ate something and threw up a little and so I used the BISSELL PET PRE-TREATER to spray the area , after wiping up the mess.I let it soak for a few minutes then used theBISSELL Spotbot Pet Handsfree Spot and Stain Cleaner with Deep Reach Technology , 33N8Ato power clean the area and it works well together , though the SPOTBOT machine works fine on its own.I think the spray is the same type of solution that you use in the SPOTBOT , so I think this can be used even if you do n't own the machine itself.Definitely keep a bottle on hand just in case .	1
Used with Bissell 2x Pet stain & Odor Full size machine formula and Bissell Big Green Deep Cleaning Machine and had wonderful results . Would highly recommend all three products and a black light so you can see what your pets have been doing around your house . Read all three of my reviews on this product . Hoover is a thing of the past as far as I 'm concerned . Has quality issues now the Bissell has mastered .	1
I have a Bissell Spotbot Pet Deep Cleaner , which is fantastic . However , there are times when I am looking to clean just a small area and do n't want to have to pull out the Spotbot , fill it , etc.I have found that the Pre-Treat works great by itself to remove some spots . It works great as intended ( pre-treating ) , but I 've used it to remove small pet food stains on rugs and it works great . It smells pleasant as well.For pre-treating , I 've used it and its removed stains like pet vomit or urine in cases where the Spotbot worked but left an area slightly darker than the rest of the carpet . A quick spray with the Pre-Treat and everything was as good as new . I typically have not left it on for the recommended time ( 12-72 hours ) , finding a half hour to be plenty . However , I did have a small , tough stain that other cleaners did not remove , so I tried this and left it covered for about a day . After a little rubbing afterward with a cloth and water , it did come out.I have used this on an off-white textured sofa and ottoman as well , and its worked effectively .	1
This pretreat works fantastic ! ! Got out stains on my beige rug I thought would never come out ! ! Let sit 15 minutes.. Use your carpet cleaner and boom ! Gone ! ! : )	1
I use it to pre-treat my carpet in heavy stained spots , but it 's also VERY handy for when my puppy has accidents here and there . Instead of cleaning my carpet all over again ( no way , it takes too much time ) , I just spray this and clean it off . I think this works better than the concentrated 2X formula , not to mention its scent is even better . If you own a puppy or a pet that is n't fully housebroken yet , buy it . You 'll be glad you have something that cleans your carpet easily and fast without the use of a cleaner .	1
With two long-haired cats , hairballs are unavoidable here , no matter how often we brush them . This spray makes it much more convenient to clean the stains off the carpet , instead of whacking with the SpotBot immediately . Spray on , let dry , and THEN SpotBot . Much cleaner . I 'm happy . Ideally I 'd change all our carpets to hardwood , but ... that 's a much more expensive solution !	1
Works great to pre-treat your carpet before cleaning , as well as an all purpose stain remover . So far I have n't encountered a stain that it has n't been able to remove .	1
Works well in getting those hard pet stains out of your rug before you steam clean it . I also use this as a regular treatment for when my dogs have an accident . It works as well as the Resolve Pet and Stain Remover . So since I try to steam clean my rugs once a month anyway , I now buy this instead of the Resolve product I was buying for quick clean ups .	1
I 've long used the Bissell Spot-Bot for the occasional stain from my cat . The machine works great , but I 've found the cost of the formula to be way too high . Happily , I got to try out this pre-treatment , and am really glad I did . Although it 's intended to be used in conjunction with the regular formula , I decided to try it alone on a couple of mild stains ( fresh ones ) . Then I loaded the machine with plain water and walked away . When I came back , the stains were completely gone - and at a fraction of the cost of using the in-machine formula . I also like that using plain water to clean up the pre-treatment means I do n't have to worry about any cleaning residue on the carpet.A third stain a few days later did require a double treatment , but it was still easier and cheaper than the old way . I 'll keep a bottle of the regular formula on-hand for really stubborn spots , but from now on will just use this and plain water . Highly recommended !	1
I typically pre-treat most stains prior to carpet cleaning . This is a ok pre-treat but I likeBISSELL Tough Stain Pre-treat for Carpet & Upholstery , 22 ozbetter . I have beige carpet and this cleaner seems to occasionally leave a residue that leaves my carpet with a pink tinge . I 've been able to remove the substance by waiting until the spot dries and going over the spot with the carpet cleaner a second time . For lighter carpets , I would recommend theBISSELL Tough Stain Pre-treat for Carpet & Upholstery , 22 oz .	1
I have to be honest - I needed a good pre-treat for carpet under a dining table that had lots of walked in food and child tossed crumbs.I knew that just a regular pre-treat was n't going to work so I decided to try the pet stain one just because I figured that if it could work on those than maybe it could break down the stains from stomped blueberries and squashed squash.I sprayed the entire area heavily and then because it was so ground in , I scrubbed it good with a plastic fiber brush - the kind you might use to clean a bath tub with . Then I let it sit a good 20nminutes while I got the carpet shampooer ready.At first a could n't see much change but after going over the area twice with my Bissel shampooer filled wit Bissle carpet shampoo and water , the stains just started to disappear.Once I was done , I was prepared to do that spot again the next day when it had dried completely.Such a surprise to look at it the next day and see that it was just as clean as the rest of the room and NO MORE STAINS ! Awesome because this a low profile carpet that is mostly white.I think it was the enzyme power that Bissel mentions that is supposed to break down pet stains SO pet stains are organic and so are food stains.I will be keeping this product on hand to catch the small spots , in future , before they become one huge spot !	1
I have aBISSELL ProHeat 2X Select Pet Upright Deep Cleaner , 94003which I use to clean-up after my indoor puppy who has had a number of pad training accidents . I like to use this to pre-treat and or clean-up accidents before steam cleaningn my carpets . It has a nice clean scent and it does seem to neutralize urine scent on cat and puppy urine.I 'd highly recommend for spot treating and for clean-up in between steaming .	1
We have 5 cats , all of whom are mostly good . Mostly . They do mark occasionally , and it repulses me . This spray is good at helping to eliminate and clean the odor . It is n't perfect ; so far nothing is . This is as good as anything I 've tried yet , and is good . It does smell nice , but more importantly , it seems to mostly remove the basic underlying scent . Good product .	1
I 've used a variety of Bissell cleaning products and machines , and it can be tough to evaluate something like this one . The problem is that since it 's a pre-treat , if you use it withBISSELL 2X Pet Stain & Odorcarpet formula or with one of their machines , it 's hard to tell which one deserves the credit.I used this on a variety of `` pet problems '' ranging from fresh pet urine to vomit . It got the odor out instantly and the carpets ended up stain free . I used aBISSELL Lift-Off Deep Cleaner , 94Y2as a portable spot cleaner , and was able to let the pre-treat do most of the work by merely giving a slight spray with the machine and a light brushing as it vacuumed up the spot . There 's no question that the two worked well in combination , and with the rotating brushes of the full machine you could expect it to do an outstanding job.I did have some older hidden stains that it did not remove , but those are ones that had already been treated with other Bissell pet and non-pet products in the past , as well as with non-Bissell products . So if you have some stains so tough that absolutely nothing seems to get them out , this one might not work miracles . And Bissell 's non-pet oriented products are pretty good to begin with , so using them alone might be all you need . But with this one and their other pet related ones in particular , they go after pet specific odors instantly and eliminate them , not just hide them .	1
I have three Border Collies who love to play Frisbee and ball . I got tired of bending over to pick up the ball , this solves that problem . I can also lob it farther for them or make it bounce extremely high .	1
My German Sheperd LOVES this ! ! He is crazy about playing ball and the Chuck it ! makes me happy to play . No more slobbery balls to throw.Your dog drops the ball at your feet ( hopefully ) and all you need to do is slap the Chuck It on the ball and toss again ! Care must be taken if using in a fenced enclosure -- the ball can travel quite a distance when & # 34 ; chucked & # 34 ; . I have gone into neighbors yards several times to retrieve an overthrown ball.This is a great toy for man and beast ! ! The rubber balls that are used with the Chuck It are sturdy and have stood up to the chomping of my dog 's jaws -- which have reduced other balls to rubble.The white ball actually does glow in the dark if you have a dog who is in to night time play .	1
Not bad but having now had both in my hands , when this one wears out i 'll be opting for the Classic 26M instead of this version . the grip on the 26 feels better to me .	1
I have a crazy lab mix that is obsessed with tennis balls . We had a smaller version of the Chuckit , which worked great until we lost it . We recently replaced it with a larger version and BOY can this one really launch my balls ! ! Its great cuz now that she 's gotten older she 's faster at chasing them down . I really like how it is sized for tennis balls too because my balls are constantly getting destroyed . But , ahh , such is life ...	1
Fun for dog owner to use . Standard tennis ball can be used . Now if we could just get the puppy to bring the ball back !	1
I wish I would have bought this a year ago . I used to walk past this in the store and think , `` Wow I should try that ! '' But the 20.00 price tag always turned me away . I already had toys to play fetch with and my dog loved the frisbee so I was n't sure if he would take to the ball the same way . I saw this on amazon and had to buy it . 10.00 was a steal . Now that I have tried it I would spend the 20.00 that the big stores ask for this . I am very happy with my purchase and it shipped very fast !	1
Loved this product . It was so easy to use my 3 year old could use it . I ca n't throw very far and this added more distance for my dog to run .	1
My dog loves playing fetch and does n't tire quickly so this was a life saver for my arm . I definitely recommend !	1
our dogs LOVE the game of fetch , This toy keeps them happy and is so easy to use ! Kids even throw the ball long distances !	1
This is small enough to fit in my backpack , fits several brands of small tennis balls ( including the squeaky Kong ones ) and REALLY gets some distance on the ball .	1
A BALL THROWING ARM EXTENSION ! It does best overhand , my uncle mike who was in Vietnam and does n't have much use of his arms after the agent orange issues he has , can use this thing like no problem , hes the reason i got it . I figured if my uncle could chuck-it 50 yards i could do a little more , honestly i only get it about 50-60 myself , I bought a set a balls definitely buy the ones from chuckit , normal balls work fine but when they get slimey the release early , plus my lab skins and splits tennis balls down the seem in about 3 mins ... she has yet to destroy a chuckit ball , but i also dont give her much of a chance to do so.Great for dogs that like to run , as long as they dont run off ! lolits been over a year now and the original set of balls are still good , the chuckit rides in the trunk just fine ... i love it	1
This thing is great . I 'm not very good at throwing the ball far for my dog . With the Chuck It , it goes all the way across the yard with ease ! We 've even lost a few balls from inadvertently chucking too hard !	1
My dog destroyed the included ball within a span of a few months . It was split open and then jest sort of flattened . The plastic launcher though is excellent ! It is very nice not having to pick up the slobbery ball with my hands . This also really gets the ball launched too . I really like it . I know Chuckit sells more solid balls , but it does n't come with this toy .	1
I have a large black lab who is only 1 1/2 yrs old . He has quite a bit of energy . He loves this ball as much as I do . He picks it up and carries it back with no problem at all so I do n't have to keep bending over for a little ball . I recommend this for everyone . It is great .	1
We absolutely love this . The kids will actually play with the dog again , before he would always try to get the ball and nip the kids . I also do n't see what the one reviewers problem was with control , ours went exactly where it should have from the beginning , even our six year old can use it	1
The chuckit pro is worth every penny . My dog is very active and lets face it the dog owner does not always feel like an extended walk at the end of a long day . The chuckit does the job as I am able to stand or sit and exercise my dog . And most importantly , my dog loves it .	1
These are the absolute greatest . Launcher will last forever if your dog does n't eat it . The set comes with the tennis-type ball . My dog chews the cover off the ball pretty quickly but he is very perseverant . Replace with the Ultra Ball . I would n't like to see the dog that can destroy one of those .	1
I got the one in the photo , what an awesome price for this ! Its not a knock off , its the real chuck it ! My pups love it .	1
My dog 's all-time favorite pastime is her small ChuckIt ! ball . She always knows exactly where it is and makes plenty of opportunities for me to toss it for her . After a while though , it gets slippery , so when I saw this Launcher I was n't sure it would work for me but decided to give it a try . Well , it does work ! It takes a small effort to get it to snap onto the ball , and then toss the ball with a flick of your wrist and the ball will fly much further than tossing it with your hand . Terrific little gadget for making playtime fun for you and your dog . Be sure to get the appropriate size for your dog 's mouth . This comes in several sizes . Make sure the ball is not small enough for the dog to accidentally get it lodged in the throat , or so large that the dog strains the jaws trying to hold on to it .	1
My dog can not live without playing fetch , and this is the perfect helper . I had shoulder surgery a year ago , and this makes it so much easier to throw the ball without hurting myself or getting worn out too quickly . Really gets good distance , and I do n't have to get yuck on my hands picking up a slobbery ball .	1
Great size for someone with a smaller dog and perhaps a smaller stature . I would n't recommend this amended size for a tall person .	1
This model wo n't & # 34 ; chuck & # 34 ; the ball as far as a full size , but it goes quite far and is more durable than the other models of the same size . It also fits in a back pack better .	1
My dog runs over to his chuckit as soon as we go out the door . It is clearly his favorite toy . I work out and play sports , but I got ta tell ya , my shoulder could n't keep up with the 3 sessions a day of trying to throw the ball far enough for my larger athletic dog to get a good run . this is perfect . Get the GLOW BALL !	1
The chuck it is a great product . We have a golden and he will retrieve all day long this product makes it possible for me to throw his ball with out getting my hands slobbery	1
Besides the Kong , that is ! If you have a dog that loves to play fetch , buy this ! Everytime it comes out of the closet my dog goes nuts and she ca n't stop fetching until I make her and put it up high and away ! Can not beat the exercise you give your dog with this , either .	1
I like the product but I think it would work better with a slightly longer handle . It works but there is a learning curve on where to stop the snaping of the arm and wrist .	1
The inventor of the chuck it is amazing - this is a great product and the craftsmanship is well designed . I love how I dont need to touch a slobbery tennis ball , it picks it up perfectly . Great product for a dog that loves to play catch for hours .	1
Allows you to throw a long way without throwing your arm out . My dogs get a lot more exercise and I enjoy it now .	1
I love this product , and so does my 7 month old puppy . She loves to run and chase the balls . Now if only I can her to bring them back to me .	1
I have bought 5 of these - I have 2 German Shepherds Dogs and they love to chew on them ! I am older and ca n't throw well now so this has come in very handy . Throws several hundred feet with ease .	1
We 've got a golden retriever and a pug russel mix and both of them are crazy for playing fetch . Unfortunately I have a pretty pathetic pitch . I have to give it everything I 've got to get any distance so after just a few throws my shoulder hurts , my hands are slimy and the dogs are still rearing to go . Which is why I LOVE THIS TOY ! ! I can send it so much farther without having to put in so much effort . My favorite part is having clean hands and tired dogs ! The product comes with one `` Chuckit '' ball but also works with standard tennis balls ( which I recommend ) . The Chuckit balls are n't very durable and it seemed like the dogs were having a harder time seeing the darker colors in the grass and water .	1
Easy to use etc etc . Recommend you buy the plastic balls that do n't come with this launcher . Much cleaner and more durable .	1
Great tool . The new grip is comfortable . The length is perfect . The ball does is average but any tennis ball works fine .	1
I first saw the Chuckit line when working at a pet store during high school . I dismissed it as simply a gimmick for people who did n't want to bend over to pick up a ball , and/or had no idea how to throw a ball . Nearly a decade later , I finally decided to give one a try.I have no problem throwing a ball a fair distance with my arm , but the Chuckit allows me to throw it even further , with significantly less effort.Though regular tennis balls work fine , I 'd recommend using the Fetch balls that Chuckit sells . Compared to tennis balls , they 're easier to clean , I do n't have to worry about my dog chewing them ( since there is no fuzz for her to rip off ) , and they bounce a lot better ( even on grass ) .I also have the Erratic ball , but do n't recommend it as much . It certainly lives up to its name when it bounces around , but its awkward shape makes it more difficult to fit snugly into the Chuckit , which makes it more difficult to throw , meaning it does n't travel nearly as far .	1
The Chuckit Launcher is a necessity if you have a dog that enjoys the game of fetch . I have always known about this product but considered it for the lazy man . My yellow lab has enough energy to make a game of fetch feel like pitching nine innings in the big leagues . It would get to the point where I would have to ice my shoulder . I eventually invested in one of these and now use it regularly . Once you get the hang of the throwing motion you can launch the ball incredible distances with very little effort.It came with a fuzzy tennis ball which I eventually replaced with a Chuck glow ball . This rubber ball is much better then any tennis ball and glows in the dark so I can use it at night.I gave this 5 stars because it has now become an essential tool to deal with my dogs energy . Keeping her exercised makes life a lot easier in the house .	1
I 've owned a Chuckit ! for over three years , and I ca n't imagine owning a dog without owning one . They are durable , inexpensive , and a great aid to throwing balls , especially for we women who do n't have the upper arm strength of you men . They also allow me to pick up the ball ( any standard tennis ball will fit , though it comes with a two toned ball ) and throw it again without bending over , and you need not touch a slobbery , muddy , grass covered wet ball . I can throw a ball at least 3-4 times farther with the Chuckit ! than without one . They are very common among local dog owners , and the dogs love them . Treat yourself and your four legged loyal friend to this great toy . I only wish I had invented it !	1
Great for a large back yard this thing will make a ball fly far .	1
Why did I wait so long to get one of these ? I blew out my elbow and my shoulder throwing tennis balls over the years . This ... . is magic ! I can toss the ball WAY high up in the air so even the old dead ones bounce . The only downside is I have to be careful not to fling the ball so far that it goes over the fence .	1
We already had a green chuck it about the same size . We got a second one so we could each have one in our car . Our dog gets so excited when she sees the chuckit that she 's a excited mess all the way to the park . So now we keep a chuckit in each of our cars , out of sight , so that we can always be prepared to play ball with our dog . The chuckit pro is nice . The grip is a nice touch and this one flings the ball further than the regular chuckits with not much effort . Maybe it 's weighted differently ? Anyway- we fight over who gets to keep the chuckit pro in their car .	1
Works great at the dog park . Do n't have to constantly bend over to pick up a nasty wet / dirty ball ! Does n't matter which size launcher you get unless you are trying out for some world wide distance competition .	1
Brooke our mini Golden Doodle loves her new launcher . So does her best friend Dan .	1
Better the wrist launchers , better then throwing ! it 's easy to swing and throw the ball about 200-250 ' Best there is .	1
It worried me at first because he showed no interest in his playmates ball when thrown . But his came in and he loves it . I am really glad I got the XL one , the ball is a great size for my Great Dane at 7 months old . At full grown I think the others would be too small	1
Great for a small dog . I wish it collapsed , though , like competing brands do . My 7.2 lb toy poodle is too small for the small chuckit balls . She is very hardy and tenacious but we use smaller squeak balls that are kind of squishy , and fit into the Chuckit launcher . I 'm disappointed that they do n't make squishy/smaller Chuckit balls . Tiny dogs like chasing balls far , too !	1
Bought this so I could throw the ball further for our Rottweiler . He loves fetch and it 's one of the only activities that actually tires him out . With minimal effort it easily doubles the distance I can throw ( with launcher 225-250 ' ) giving our pup double the exercise per throw . It also increases the speed of the ball and I 've noticed that our dog is more excited to play fetch when he has to chase a faster moving object and exerts more energy when chasing . It could be that we play enough fetch ( at least three 10-15 min sessions a day ) that I 'm going to feel a bit sore , or it could be that the launcher makes me use muscles that I do n't normally use , but either way it 's still a minor arm workout for me . I 'm 6 ' and have trained my dog to bring the ball to me and put it in my hand . If the ball is on the ground I still have to bend over some to click it into the launcher , so I just have him hand me the ball and I stick it in the launcher . I do n't mind the slobber and since the `` no bending '' feature does n't apply to me I 'm happy to bring a towel . Still waiting to find a place large enough and open enough to really chuck it and see how far it goes .	1
Great toy but I ordered the large by mistake . I will have to order a small one . I have given the large one to my daughter who has two labs .	1
Classic - the large size lets you launch the ball far . Sturdy construction . Our dog park has one for all to share and sure saves on the arm for throwing .	1
I 've had mine for 7 years now and found it is the by far the best way to exercise my tireless , ball-obsessed German Shepherd as well as my goofy , fetch-loving Lab mix puppy . When she was younger , I would take my Shepherd for daily 5 mile walks that would barely begin to drain her energy . This is the only thing I 've found that would truly tire her out ( without knocking myself out in the process ) . And even now at 7 , she 's like a puppy again every time she sees the Chuck-it come out . I had surgery on both hands this year and had a hard time throwing balls at all , never mind far enough for them to get any exercise . With this , I could still play ball with them , despite limited use of my hands . Best of all , as most other reviewers have already stated , you 'll never have to touch a slimy grass-covered ball again . Kudos to the genius who created this toy !	1
This is exactly what I expected . Makes throwing the ball way easier ! ! The dogs get excited when they see me pull this out !	1
I bought the Chuckit to use indoors to fling paperwads and Savvy Tabby mylar balls for a cat , and it works great .	1
So much nicer than picking up slimy balls and it throughs the balls a nice distance . Works with regular tennis balls which is great . My dog always gets excited when he sees me get it out .	1
Normal sized tennis balls fit nicely in this dog toy . Our Border Collie has boundless energy and this thing tosses the ball quite a ways and gives him a good run . Love it !	1
There 's something about the Chuckit that drives my dog nuts . She 'll bark at anyone holding it who does n't throw the ball immediately . Plus , if you get the end of an empty Chuckit near her mouth , it 's a chew toy . So , it 's a Chuckit and a Chewit . This thing can keep her entertained for hours.The Jr ( now called 18M ) is perfect for active small dogs or medium dogs , and when you lose the ball that came with it ( and you will when another dog runs off with the ball ) , the Jr will fit regular tennis balls .	1
Most comfortable Chuckit we have owned , easy on the hands , balls launch easily and travel far enough to give big dogs a workout	1
This really saves my arm when out playing with the dogs . They love it too ! Be warned though that the ball will go FAR and that the smaller version may be more appropriate if you have a smaller yard .	1
I started with the smaller chuckit and my dog fell in love with that toy ! We took it to the dog park and another dog ran up to us so excited b/c he loves playing fetch too and recognized the toy . We have a very large yard and the small one let us throw it about 3/4 of the way . I wanted to run my lab puppy even more so I bought this one and it is probably because I started with the smaller one , but I feel like it is awkward to use the bigger one and I can still only throw it 3/4 of the way down our yard . It flies a lot higher and gives my dog more time to run down to where it will land before it bounces , but I prefer the small version of this toy . But , it works as intended and my dog does n't care which one I use , she loves the game .	1
Item arrived as expected ... Great toy for those dogs that love to fetch ... and it saves your shoulder and arm : ) My Border Collie loves this item , and yes I can wear him out now before he wears me out . : )	1
My husband and I love seeing who can launch the ball the farthest for our springer spaniel . I can barely get the ball from the pitching mound to home plate , so this thing saves my arm from having to repeatedly throw the ball short distances for the energetic dog.Some people said that they have trouble with how the ball releases from the launcher . I never had this problem -- it always released at just the right time for a perfect distance . My husband , however , has trouble with it releasing to LATE ( some people had problems with it releasing too early ) . I guess it varies from person to person !	1
Good for easy long throws . My high drive Malinois needs the exercise . I useChuckit ! Medium Max Glow Ball 2.5-Inch , 1-Packwhich not only hold their glow in the dark , but are indestructible `` just right '' for holding and chewing . Cool and funPlanet Dog Orbee-Tuff Whistle Ball Dog Toyworks too , but not for chewing . The colored `` tennis '' balls are made of toxic materials ( which is ingested ) and the fur grinds down teeth .	1
My Marley loves to go after the balls from Chuckit launcher and never gets tired of doing it ... definitely a Golden Retriever .	1
Nothing can beat a chuckit in quality and ease . The balls fit perfectly . I 'd highly recommend the rebound blue rubber balls . Enjoy !	1
Perfect for playing fetch with my dog . I do n't have to bend my back to pick up the balls after my dog retrieves it . It is the authentic quality .	1
My dog loves to play fetch and this works great ! The only think I did n't like about the smaller one is that it has a shorter handle . I wish it was still the full length so it is easier to get off the ground .	1
Are you sick and tired of picking up slobbery , wet , drool dripping tennis balls ? Then the answer to your problems is in the Chuck It . I can spend hours at the part with this toy playing with me dog . It 's very sturdy and easily grabs the ball from the ground . It did take some time to be able to adjust how I threw the ball with it so that it did n't just fly into the ground ( I put too much arm swing into it ) . This toy helps you throw the ball farther than with just your arm and keeps your hands clean . The Chuck It does come in a few different sizes also , depending on the size of your dog . It also comes in a variety of colors . Something else that I like about this dog toy is that the balls come in BRIGHT colors so I never loose them ! If you have a dog that likes to play fetch with tennis balls , or a dog full of energy this is the toy for you !	1
I bought one of these and ended up using it for the neighbor dogs more than my own because of the fact that he would not bring it back to me to throw again . Recently , at the age of 2 he has now realized the point of fetch and loves how far I can throw the ball with this . He plays until he can barely catch his breath , so I have stop and give him breaks , otherwise he would just keep going . Also keeps the slober off you and on the ball where it belongs .	1
I bought this for my very enthusiastic lab who was OBSESSED with chasing balls . She LIVED to chase a ball . This one was more economical , I did n't have to pay shipping due to Amazon Prime and it was quick delivery . Unfortunately , Maggie passed away at the age of 3 in her prime . She passed due to complications delivering puppies . The breeder offered me another dog . We will be going to get her on Saturday . She will be enjoying it in Maggie 's memory . Our new dog wo n't replace Maggie but she 'll fill a hole . God Bless you Maggie !	1
I absolutely love this product . Our dog can play fetch for hours and the ball gets nasty ! With this , I never have to touch the ball and I can launch it much further than normally !	1
Wears the dog out 3x faster . The dog is a husky so of course he is full of energy to the point of where I need to throw this ball a billion times but now I just need to throw it a few million times .	1
We love our 1 year old Labrador Retriever ... however , contrary to popular belief , he would n't retrieve much . You see , my husband is an avid hunter and although we did not buy the dog only for hunting - we wanted a family dog that can go like we do - we had hoped that one way we could get him exercised would be through retrieving . We attempted to begin the awakening of genetics early ( the day we brought him home ) . However , we have children , and although we warned them many times and watched the dog training videos together , as a family , on a loop for days - they thought playing chase and tag with him was a load of fun ( which , lets be honest , it is ) ! Needless to say , he would chase the ball , BUT good luck getting him to bring it back ! After the children realized what they had actually done - they vowed no more chase with balls ... and we have attempted to begin the training over again . A couple of months ago I started working with him with a Kong ball - the red one . He would retrieve for a little bit - 5 or so throws and then start messing around . I read and watched more videos and worked/played more with him ... but he would lose interest , and I had a SLIMEY hand - gross . So , when I saw the Chuck-it and it was on sale - I bought it . I thought at least my hand would not be so icky . It was L-o-V-e at first throw for this guy ! He is absolutely obsessed ! We bought the rubber balls as he is an avid chewer and would destroy a tennis ball in 2 seconds flat - and the rest is history . I do n't think the only reason he is retrieving now is due only to the Chuck-It being so awesome , although it is pretty great . We really worked with him . But it came to our house at just the right time and now I have a clean hand and a VERY happy retriever , who also happens to be a Labrador : D	1
Both of my Pit Bulls adore this toy . It 's a little shorter than the regular one , but still goes a good distance . It holds regular tennis balls and anything that size . When I first started bringing my new dog to the dog park , the Chuck-It was my way to get his attention , and for him to follow me to the exit to leave so I did n't have to chase him down . It 's like it hypnotizes my dogs . Gives them fabulous exercise too !	1
I have an 8-pound toy poodle whose passion is fetching balls . Her mouth is so small she could not get the regular chuckit ball in her mouth and carry it very far . I ordered this mini-chuckit and though the ball is a little bigger than her very small balls , it works fine and she catches it in her mouth as it 's heading toward earth . I have noticed that this mini-chuckit hurles the ball much farther than the regular , which is great because she loves to go far to fetch it . We use this launcher several times a day and we never get tired of it . The ball it came with got trashed within a month so I bought Tuff Balls to replace it . We absolutely love this launcher . It 's fabulous for the beach . You ca n't go wrong with this if your little toy dog loves fetching .	1
Wow , this thing can hurl the tennis ball and the other chuckit products far ! Dogs love it , I love it bc no more slimy tennis balls or bending over to pick them up .	1
Walking your large breed dog is not exercise . This tool is exercise ! Saves my arm and makes our Shepherd very happy and sleepy . FYI works with a normal tennis ball , she did n't care for the chuck-it ball very much , prefers a normal tennis ball . Highly recommended for the & # 34 ; fetchers & # 34 ; .	1
I had a chuck it and never used it for several years . I just bought a new one as we have an Australian Shepherd who is a `` ball hound . '' I read the instructions/tips for throwing well and discovered that its `` all about the follow through . `` In order to throw successfully , i need to be standing up and follow through . It works great . I 'm buying some more balls ( including one that glows in the dark ) to keep my dog well exercised.I highly recommend this item .	1
I bought this item because others at the local dog park made it look so easy ! Load , toss , dogs run ! Fun right ? Well theres a little more to it . it takes a quick snap , and lost of practice to get the hang of this thing , once you do , both you and your dog/s will love it . Better buy extra balls ! This thing is gon na become part of the family !	1
I am so glad I tried this new version of the chuckit ! I own a labrador . He is a slave to a tennis ball . However , we use the kong squeaky balls instead of the harder chuckit balls . Often they get dirty or currently icy and are larger than an average tennis ball . It is nearly impossible to get the chuckit to grab and then release the ball to throw it . Often it just sticks in the holder and he barks and barks when I futilely try to fling the ball again and again . I 've even broken the grabber end trying to 'stretch it out ' so the ball will release.Hard to describe , but this version of the chuckit is just great . The whole white stick is more flexible and springy and the ball grabber end is also more flexible so the ball does n't get stuck.GREAT improvement and definitely better than the original design . It 's worth the money and the only style I 'll buy in the future . Each chuckit lasts over a year for me ...	1
Love it . Ca n't throw a tennis ball without it . Took a few times to figure out how to launch but it 's great to get your dog to run far . Great exerciser . The balls that come with it are great too . Bright and easy to launch	1
At first it 's a little tricky to throw properly , but then maybe I 'm a little spazzy . My 4.5lb Yorkie loves to play fetch . The further the ball flies the more she likes it . If she 's happy , I 'm happy . Overall I like the product .	1
My 8 month old golden loves to chase balls and I have bad rotator cuffs , so I was hoping this would really help me . My backyard is fairly large ( 1/3 acre ) so I expected I would have no problem keeping the ball in our fenced area - wrong ! If I use slightly too much & # 34 ; oomph & # 34 ; it goes over the fence , and if I scale it back a titch too much , it goes into the ground 6 feet in front of me . I 've had a lot more success out at the dog park where I can let it fly and not worry that I 'll send my 60 pound puppy crashing into a fence .	1
Better than the chuckit sport 25m launcher that I had , it was not clear from the pictures but this one has soft handle grips and a little more flex , I find it an improvement on the 25m sport one .	1
I think it 's great but only if I can get my dog to fetch the ball back to me when we are outdoors ! But at least I do n't have to pick up slimy balls with my hands !	1
Love these ! On our fourth one . Dog has chewed the others up ... blame the humans for leaving them where the puppy can get them . They DO save your arm though and are easy to use . Chucks a ball nice and far ... hours of entertainment for our lab puppy !	1

SAVES A LOT OF WEAR AND TEAR ON YOUR ARM , PLUS GIVES YOUR PUP A GOOD WORK OUT . THE ONLY THING IT 'S NOT NEARLY AS 'STURDY ' AS THE OLD ONE I HAD , A BIT MORE DELICATE .	1
We are on our third one now not because of the quality but because our dog things it 's a chew toy . I 'm able to throw a ball pretty far with this and keeps my dog entertained	1
Comfortable in my hand and triples how far I can throw . I think I can make it go a good 50 yards . We love it !	1
This is one of my dogs favorite toys . She loves to chase balls . I would advise buying extra balls . I have difficulty bending over and I make her drop the ball she just chased before I throw another . I would have no problem buying this again . It is great for people with mobility problems who still want to play with their dog .	1
My dog and my husband absolutely love the Launcher . We purchased the one that holds a standard tennis ball . I bought the launcher and a bag of tennis balls for my husband to take 'Z ' to the park .	1
My 20lb terrier loves to chase these small tennis balls and this ball launcher helps me to keep playing without making my arm sore . You can sit on a bench , pick the ball up , and throw it quite a ways without ever getting up . This would be a good gift for a senior dog lover or someone with limited mobility . Also good for someone who is n't a great thrower , like me !	1
We have three corgis and now three chuck its . Those little guys go crazy now , when we pick it up , since they love retrieving so much . Excellent product for my purposes .	1
I originally had a large chuck it but it wore out and would not hold the ball in well.So I went to amazon looking for something that would last longer , and found this ... I took a chance on it because I did not see this specific model launcher on the chuckit website and the stock photo is photo shopped ( shows 2 different model numbers ) at the time of purchase there were no reviews.It works and feels a lot less flimsy/flexible than the orange one I originally bought from pet food express ... this does however make it a lot more work to launch the ball further..but hopefully it wont wear out .	1
We have a standard poodle with a ball fetish . She loves ( and this is not a strong enough word ) tennis balls or anything that can be thrown and returned . We have a large backyard but when I throw the tennis ball ( without the Chuckit ) , she just looks at me with an exasperated , `` Really ? '' The Chuckit allows me to throw the ball clear across our ( did I mention large ? ) yard . I can throw it for a long time without ever getting a sore shoulder or arm and the BEST PART is that I never have to touch a slobbery , muddy ball . Picking the ball up with the Chuckit is very easy , as long as the dog is n't attacking the ball while I 'm trying to get it off the ground.This is a highly recommended product . We 've had three ( ours stay outside and get chewed on and bent by the kids at some point ) . And I will continue to buy them as others wear out .	1
absolutely amazing . i 've had this for over a year now and it 's the best $ 10 I 've spent . I never have to touch a slobbery ball and it makes playing fetch so much more fun ! highly recommended !	1
This is the perfect sized Chuckit for my Maltese puppy . He can fit the balls in his mouth which he can not do with most because of their size . Even though it 's a `` mini launcher '' it still sends the ball a fair ways , especially for a small dog .	1
I purchased this when I purchased the medium max glow ball . I love it because not only does it enhance my wimpy throwing , but it saves my gloves when I 'm playing with my dog in our super muddy backyard . I would n't purchase it for a super small space because I have to be careful not to throw it over our fence . The ball really does go a long way when you use this . I definitely recommend using it if you have enough room .	1
What can I say , this is the famous chuckit for a reason . We love it and it lives up to all it 's claimed to be .	1
I wanted a second Chuckit ! , so I saw this deal & ordered one . It 's longer than the one we already had & it sends the ball further . The dogs really get a good work-out .	1
It 's hard for me to tire my dogs out , but this certainly helps ! Paired with the whistle balls it keeps them busy for a loooooong time . I have a big yard so I need one of these to throw the ball all the way across it . I 've also taken it to my local dog park where I can get some serious distance .	1
My dog Buster loves chasing balls and this enables me to toss a regular tennis ball the distance of about half a football field . Great idea ! Prefer this the longer version , since I do n't have to reach down so far to pick up the ball .	1
I love this Chuckit ! , and appreciate that I 'm able to throw the ball a LONG distance . More importantly , my ADHD puppy loves this gadget !	1
I 've had a chuckit for 15 years , yes it has lasted that long . I got a new one because of the handle looking more comfortable . The handle is a bit shorter then the original one I had and I love it . My arm is n't sore after useing it with my 2 big dogs and I have much better control .	1
This has been on my & # 34 ; puppy wishlist & # 34 ; for almost 6 months . I 've hesitated to buy it for who knows what reason . It 's not expensive . My dog loves to play fetch.This takes fetch to a whole new level . I can throw pretty far , but get tired out . This can throw twice as far and my dog goes nuts when I bring it out . I got the whistle balls too , which make him even nuttier . We played with this today until he could fetch no more . That 's never happened before . It has a compact size , but can throw quite a distance . I have n't completely got the skill of using it down yet , but it 's still pretty effective . If you are thinking about buying this , stop . Add to your cart , get a couple extra balls , and check out .	1
I 've been told I 'throw a ball like a girl . ' It must be true , because when I throw a ball it does n't go very far ( by the way I 'm a woman , not a man ) . I ca n't throw very far with this launcher , either , but I know they work well because I watch my neighbor use his Chuck It Ball Launcher for his retriever-type dog and he can the ball to go REALLY far . I 'm up to about 30 ' myself with the Chuckit , which I admit is n't very far . But then again , my dog does n't really 'retrieve ' balls anyway , she just runs around with them in her mouth until I go and take the ball from her , so it 's just as well . But whatever , this launcher makes my ball-throwing time with my dog more fun .	1
Saves a lot of wear and tear on throwing and retrieving the ball from the ground . ( Most shelter dogs have n't learned 'fetch and leave it ' , LOL ! !	1
I have gotten products like this before and they were terrible . This one actually picks up the balls and man can you launch those balls . My dog loves it	1
This is an awesome product . Our dog gets more exercise now that we can throw the ball twice as far , plus we 're not having to touch the gross ball after it 's rolled through the mud and water .	1
First Impression : Someone gave me the Chuckit Ball Launcher as a gift . It seems to be for lazy humans . Fetch is not my favorite game , so we do n't use this toy very often . However even Mom can make the ball go pretty far with the device . For the most part I just look at her like `` Why did you throw the ball way over there ? '' then she goes and gets it for me . Do n't get me wrong I like to chew on the ball ... But why should I retrieve it ? I 'm not a retriever ! Conclusion : If you like to fetch , this is a great device for your parents to buy . They will be able to throw the ball farther , and they wo n't wear out as quickly . Plus if they are `` old '' they do n't even have to bend over to pickup the ball ! They can use the Launcher as a handle and press the cup onto the ball . Nifty . 3 out of 4 stars because Rottie 's are not big on fetch .	1
This is a great accessory for any dog family . Just stock up on tennis balls cause this think chucks them far . Whats nice is you can use anykind of tennis ball not just the chuck it brand ones .	1
Chuckit is the best invention for dog lovers EVER ! ! ! You will never have to touch another slimy , dirty ball again thanks to Chuckit . You can also throw the ball about three times as far with Chuckit . I would suggest buying the Chuckit Ultra Balls to go with it . They are the best balls ever , virtually indestructible .	1
We have 6 Rotties and the standard tennis balls do n't last - plus I worry about them swallowing them . So we got this big guy and the rubber Chuckit Large sized balls . Perfect . I can really throw this thing . Drain some energy , get the dogs some exercise , work on impulse control and training . Love it . Really appreciate the larger size .	1
My family adopted a Golden Retriever who loves to fetch . Problem is she 's a slobbery mess , and I hated touching the balls . I also ca n't throw very far when compared to how fast she runs , so games were short , and she was n't exercising her full potential.Not any more ! I can probably throw the ball 250 feet now , and my dog is huffing and puffing in a few minutes ! I usually play with two balls , one she is fetching , and the other is ready to go when she comes back . She was n't very fond of the tennis ball that comes with the launcher , however I ordered some of the orange chuck-it balls and she 's doing well with those . You 'll definitely need a large open area to use this though ! Definitely worth the money .	1
With this , I can really get good distance on our fetch game . My dog is pretty fit and throwing short distances gets tiring for my arm because the dog brings the ball back so quickly . This gives my arm a break and the dog a longer run . Love it !	1
This product performs well and delivers what I was looking for in my first ChuckIt ball launcher-a standard tennis ball launcher that is sturdy , has a comfortable grip and is more portable than ChuckIt 's longer launcher . I will probably also get the longer version for the dog park because it allows you to pick up the ball without bending as much , but I like this model a lot and would recommend it .	1
This is the real deal . It works like a charm . It took a couple dozen throws for the clamp to loosen up . Now it 's perfect .	1
We love this product . I can not throw worth beans so this really does the trick when I play with our ball loving Airedale . I recommend the shorter handle for better control ... like this one that I purchased .	1
I have 2 dogs and one of them just LOVES to play fetch , especially with balls . She gets excited just seeing this because she knows it means play time . I also bought a variety of balls . Her favorite is the whistling ball . This size also works for a standard tennis ball , which I use if I might loose the ball since I have lots of these . I would recommend this for anyone who has a dog who likes to fetch balls .	1
I can throw my dog 's ball way farther using this , wearing her out way faster , and I never have to pick up a gross slobbery ball . What more could you want . Get one .	1
We use this launcher at a field next to our apartment complex . Our Pembroke Welsh Corgi has a lot of energy and this really helps us throw the tennis ball multiple times really far without throwing out our arms in the process . With minimal effort , you can throw a ball 15ft or so . With a good amount of effort , it will fly as far as 50ft easily . We also like that we can pick up the tennis ball with this Chuckit without having to bend over , as well as getting our fingers all slobbered up . I highly recommend this toy for anyone who has a dog that loves to play fetch and has the space to really run .	1
Great toy for our dog ! Makes it easier to throw further and for longer - the dog loves it . We have a vizsla so she can be tough to wear out , but this does the job .	1
My dog is really active and I call this my & # 34 ; life savor & # 34 ; because when I have it she will do practically anything to get me to chuck it too her . As a girl I never learned how to throw a ball far enough for the dog to get a good run out of it.Of course it 's a natural for a golden or lab retriever , they seem to go on automatic !	1
Use it with the Nite Ize MTLP-08-07 MeteorLight K-9 Led dog ball , Disc-O and it works great ! I can throw way farther with less effort and keeps you from having to pick up dirty tennis balls or other	1
My greyhounds run like lightening , and I 'd practically throw out my shoulder using tennis balls . By the time the balls landed on the ground my dogs would have already ran past the landing point . The chuckit allows me to save myself from overexerting my shoulder and arm muscles , but it also allows me to achieve a further throw than with just my body alone . I love this thing !	1
This product is easy to use and , of course , most dogs love to fetch . The pick-up and throw is not perfect but it is very good and we like to use it . Would recommend it .	1
We were having a grand time with this toy , and my dog enjoyed running the extra distance . That was until I handed it over to my boyfriend who & # 34 ; Chucked it & # 34 ; as hard as he could and our tennis ball was lost forever ... Ok , so that 's not really a problem since you can put whatever kind of tennis ball you want in there , but buyer beware : You must understand physics to avoid losing your dog 's favorite tennis ball or possibly chucking a ball into a passing car . It really depends on where you live .	1
My pup is in love with this . I had never seen the small launchers in stores however I had the balls so I looked it up online and found this . It is more difficult then it looks and it takes a bit to get use to throwing the ball with this but my pooch is happy now that I can throw his ball much much farther . I was never a good pitcher . Whenever he sees his chuck it he gets excited and starts whining . In fact ... He gets excited if he sees anyone 's chuck it at the dog park , and that person , has earned a new 7 lb shadow . Brody was more of a keep away dog he would never drop the ball for me easily . So I 'd launch the ball with this and feed him a treat in the chuck it launcher itself . Now he gives the ball up every time I have it up for a seamless game of fetch .	1
I bought this for my best friend since she has a couple of yellow labs and she was looking for an easier way to throw a ball for them to chase . The fact that you do not have to touch the slimy ball once they bring it back is a MAJOR bonus ! ! I bought her both the regular size and the Jr. Breeze now lets my best friend know when it is time to play with the Chuck It . What a great idea / toy ! !	1
like not having to touch the slobbering balls . you have to practice throwing b/c when you throw it , the balls will go far . best for big yards .	1
Such a easy tool for our energized puppies ! I had some problems with my wrist . It causes trouble for me when I throw a ball.I could not play with my 2 young dogs . This tool is so easy for me . I can throw a ball for them far and fast enough that they have to run hard to catch it.Even my 5 year old son can easily get the ball over 100 yards away.Dogs love it ! Works great for us.The size is perfect . but we did not try the long one .	1
Great launcher , our pup loves playing ball , and so this is ideal for throwing the ball further than we 'd ordinarily be able to .	1
This launcher has saved my arm . My lab could play fetch all day and the launcher allows me to pick up the ball without touching it and throw it farther than just my arm can manage . It 's also short enough to hide inside my jacket when it 's time to stop playing . Kudos for the launcher !	1
This works really well ! Sadly , my dog has no interest in playing fetch ... but we 're working on it with him.This holds the ball tight , making it so you can shove the ball in and take it to wherever you 're playing the game without much worry , and it throws it pretty far ! Would recommend , but would suggest teaching your dog to fetch first .	1
While this will send a ball flying with little effort it 's worth the money to not have to directly handle the nasty tennis balls at my local dog park . It handles standard tennis balls just as well as the ball that comes with it ( which of course got lost in a bush on day one ) .	1
This is the & # 34 ; Pro & # 34 ; version and it sends the ball 50 % farther than the standard 26M . Measured the average throw today ; it was 273 feet . The dog caught the ball on the roll , otherwise it would 've rolled farther . Admittedly , this was with the wind , but 273 feet is incredible . Using a standard pressure-less ball , presumably the Chuck-it ball would go farther . This extra throw-distance appears to be mostly from the thinner and smoother arm . Less wind resistance.The thinner arm does feel a little more flexible , but it 's still very controllable . It 's easy to place the throw exactly where one wants.The Pro version is about an inch shorter than the 26M , which may not matter to most folks , but it means an extra inch bending over . An inch wo n't matter to most , but if one has a bad back and a dog that insists on fifty or more tosses per session , it adds up . Nevertheless , the dog gets a better workout and the Pro version is worth the extra few bucks.The handle is much more comfortable too . Rubberized and form-fitting . The original Chuck-it was the best man-dog interactive toy ever ; this new Pro version is a refinement over the original and well worth it..	1
This is great for playing fetch without having to touch drooly , dirty balls . Plus , I can launch the balls extra far and tire out my pup more quickly !	1
This thing is great . You can grab the ball from the ground in almost any circumstance . My only problem was learning to aim with it . Many trips were made to the neighbors yard..haha .	1
Best launcher I have tried after buying many other that lose grip and do not trow properly . I your dog enjoys playing fetch it is a must to have .	1
I have a 30 lb dog that is stupidly fast and loves to fetch . She can fetch for hours ... even when I am throwing it as far as I can ( which is a good distance ) . So this chuck it launcher is awesome because now we can go and have fun and she can really get going . Plus i do n't have to pick up that nasty ball ... .I do suggest getting the chuck it ultra balls because they are rubber and bounce more , so your dog can see it when its farther away . Also , it does n't pick up as much dirt , so it stays cleaner too . This was a problem I saw with my dog because the regular tennis balls collected so much dirt that she would accidentally swallow some as she was fetching and then end up dry heaving later that night ... ..I also suggest getting the pro version of chuck it because the handle is soooo much better that its worth the extra money.Caution though ... if you throw it to far and your dog isnt paying attention or isnt quick enough to find it before it stops bouncing ... you will be walking a long way to find the ball for them ... especially if you paid extra money for the nicer chuckit ultra balls . Luckily my dog is OCD and has to have the first ball we throw , so if she misses it she searches for it for at least 10 min before giving up.Oh and the Chuckit works ok with regular tennis balls , but it is sized just a bit smaller than a tennis ball size . So , it doesnt quite release the ball as quickly . I only use the ultra balls though ... so no complaints by me .	1
This allows me throw my dogs ' favorite balls faster and farther then with my own arm . The only problem is that one of my dogs thinks this is also a chew toy and chewed it up partially so I must be carefully to keep it our of reach when not in use . I does take some force to release the ball when throwing it so my PK daughter is not able to use it even though she really wants to . I still highly recommend this product .	1
This is my 4th Chuckit or so . We use them until they break or one of the dogs eats it . I like them a lot and wish I had the patent . This is made out of a softer plastic than the others . I prefer the previous ones , but still it is a wonderful item .	1
We have a 8 month old male Doberman that needs lots of exercise and likes to chase a ball unless he gets distracted by a pretty little Boxer , Dalmatian or whatever other female is within 500 feet of him . We have a huge dog park that opened recently near our home and this has been a activity for us to enjoy there . This size might be overkill because you can really send the ball flying but with a little practice it works great and gives you plenty of options . My wife sends the ball about 50 yards and she is petite . I like the fact that I do n't have to pick up a ball with slobber all over it anymore.On a side note I recommend using the Chuckit medium Ultra Balls because they are easy to clean and last longer than the fuzzy balls .	1
I really like this launcher . It works really well , but I 'm thinking of someday buying the longer one . I opted on this one as the long one indicated it threw farther . I did n't want to launch it so far I 'd lose the ball or end up chasing my dog to get him to come back , so for the length of the throw is perfect and it 's very easy to snatch the ball up for continued throwing . My significant other is 6'1 & # 34 ; so he has to do some bending to pick up the balls which is okay for him , but the intention had been to make it easier for him . One thing I 've noticed is that this does not put the stress on my shoulder that thowing by hand thowing does . This makes our dog , Diego , very happy because he can play and play and play .	1
I love these Throwers , which I get for the use at my local Dog Park . They are durable and well made and after the original ball is ruined by slobbering dogs , chewing and crunching on the balls , the nice thing is that they can be used with regular tennis balls .	1
You need to have a big dog for this XL model because the all is what 's XL . All Chuck it products are great quality and dogs love 'em all .	1
My 3 year old Springer is a tennis ball nut ! There 's nothing she loves more than her tennis balls except maybe chasing them - practice for catching the squirrels on our property ! This Chuckit is easy to use and once you get the hang of it you can pitch a ball a long distance saving on elbows and shoulders . Any tennis ball will work in the head of the device . The best way to lob a ball a goodly distance is to NOT insert the ball all the way into the head . Place the ball about half way in , just enough so it does n't fall out , take a standing or sitting position , and swing your arm up from a ground pointing position to just head level and let fly ! Pretend you are a kid again and swing your arm like a windmill . Just stop the motion when your arm is pointing straight towards the heavens . The ball will launch at least 50-80 feet in an arch . Great invention and I love it and my dog loves it . In all fairness to anyone who is n't finding it easy to use , well , neither has my husband been overly successful at using it either but then he 's not very coordinated , LOL ! Such a simple device and I only wish I had thought of it . Buy it and your dog will love you forever and you wo n't suffer any more shoulder pain pitching those balls for that slobbering ball of fur you own . Enjoy !	1
The dog 's favorite toy ! I use it with all of the different balls that chuckit sells , and the dog always comes home tired . It does exactly what you think it does , and actually works better if you do n't try to throw it as hard as you can .	1
I 've bought a LOT of toys on amazon for my pup & let me just say - I should have started with a ChuckIt . I used to see everyone with one so I finally gave in to see what all the hype was about . BEST INVESTMENT EVER ! ! ! Saves your shoulder , my dog loves it , and you can throw the ball very far . Great for the dog park or dog beach . No complaints . Would definitely recommend .	1
This is great - especially for big dogs . If you have should issues or limited mobility , this will allow you to play with your furry friends .	1
We have a mixed lab , 75 lbs . I wanted to get something for the winter time when the ball gets too muddy to keep throwing by hand . This is also fun for kids to use . Mine arrived in orange . I also wanted something compatible with tennis balls since we have so many , I was worried when I read the other reviews but took a chance . Ours does work with tennis balls , kind of a snug fit but works fine .	1
Sadly , my dog is n't into chasing things and I had hoped this toy would get her excited about it but no such luck ( that 's a `` manufacturing issue '' with my dog moreso than this product ! ) . The chuck-it ! works exactly as advertised , no complaints there !	1
I watch my neighbor 's 6 lb . toy Yorkshire Terrier ( Bella ) about half of time and she loves to play fetch . The problem is that she is so fast that she can outrun the ball ( I admit I do n't throw a very mean ball ) . The Chuckit changed the game for us.Bella is too small to be able to hold a regular sized tennis ball properly in her mouth ( she has to pick it up by the `` fuzz '' ) but these 2 inch balls are a perfect size for her . When we are outside and she sees me rear back the thrower , BAM , she takes off ! I try to aim the ball in front of her and as soon as she sees it land she goes for it.With this launcher I can throw the Ultra ball about 40 yards or so . It comes with a 2 '' tennis-type ball which does n't go as far as the Ultra ball . I really enjoyed the Mini Launcher but I wanted to be able to throw the ball even farther so I purchased the older style launcher which has a much longer handle . I use that one all of the time now . Not only can I throw the ball farther and higher , it 's also easier to pick up the ball when it is on the ground . Still , if you do n't need the extra distance this one work just fine.Chuckit ! Ultra Ball Small 2-inch , 2 packChuckit ! Mini Ball Launcher ( Colors Vary )	1
sure , i like to strengthen my arm like a pro pitcher but this just makes things so much easier ( and cleaner ) ! ! this contraption throws the ball so much farther than I can ! Which means my doggie can run much farther too ! Which means she gets tired faster ! and goes to sleep sooner ! ! this is the best thing ever created ! ! ! ! and when she sees me pick it up ( i mean i could just be moving it out of the way ) she goes insane ! ! it also doubles as a water bowl . one day we were outside playing fetch and it was pretty hot . I had my camelbak on but i did n't bring her water bottle . I put the water from my camelbak into the hollow in the launcher and she just drank the water out of that . pretty nifty , eh ?	1
Since the ball is the same size as a tennis ball it can be replaced easily without paying the premium for a Chuckit ball .	1
the release and hold allows you to control the length of throw without worrying about the ball falling out or not releasing ! i use with my puppy for short distances to work on eye focus !	1
Our dogs love it and has been a favorite for over 3 years . They hold up well to daily usage . In 3 years we have only had one break . We keep one in the house and one we travel with . We also have a couple of the other Chuck-it toys . The balls hold up amazingly well that come with it or that you can purchase as extras.The price is good , got it cheaper on Amazon than at a local & # 34 ; pet supply store & # 34 ; .	1
Keeps your hands from getting slobbery or muddy from the ball , greatly reduced bending for the ball , and throws it farther than I could without assistance . As far as this particular product , it works like it 's supposed to and is durable . No complaints .	1
I have the shorter version too . This length of handle and M size is perfect for tossing and picking up Chuckit balls AS WELL AS regular ole tennis balls . We use this one just about every day .	1
My dog can chase a ball for hours , but unfortunately the family does n't last that long . I was originally skeptical about this , but I had seen someone at the park with one and thought I would give it a try . It does take a few times to figure out the ideal launch , but after that this works like a charm . My young children are able to join in the fun now too . The added bonus is how the launcher will retrieve the slimy ball without my having to touch it .	1
Fantastic throwing device ! I received this 26M Chuckit in great condition and on time . The first time I used it I almost threw the ball over the trees into the horse pasture next door . It is easy to throw the tennis ball close to 75 yards . This thing really launches the ball with very little effort . Great for these light weight tennis balls which always seem to bother my elbow when I throw them . I may actually order the shorter version to reduce overthrown balls . Works great to pick the ball up also . The ball snaps right into place just as advertised .	1
I 'm not the strongest thrower in the world , but with this I can really send a ball flying for my dogs to chase . This is a lot of fun , and our German Shepherd in particular practically does backflips when he sees me grab the Chuckit . We use this every day and have a ton of fun with it .	1
I got these on sale . Can never have too many tennis balls with my lab puppy . I love the orange color if we get distracted and loose a ball .	1
These are `` mini '' and good for small dogs , but I should have noticed how small since I have a larger dog .	1
But still a solid product , dog loves them , they 're highly visible in water or snow , and are durable . But like all tennis balls , they get a bit icky , and you ca n't really rinse them as well as the Ultras .	1
Quality tennis balls that last with dogs ! Works with chuck-it or just for throwing around . Endurable . No problems at all .	1
I love the Chuckit ! Let 's me throw a ball MUCH farther , for my fetch-crazy dogs , than I can throw by hand ! Also saves me from having to pick up slimy wet balls , since my dogs will drop them at my feet and I just pop the throwing stick over the ball and heave it again . These replacement balls work perfectly with the throwing stick - my only complaint is that the balls are not as durable as real tennis balls . The balls that came with the original throwing stick split in half under the abuse my Cattle Dog gave them . Now he 's a senior citizen and has no interest in fetching - so maybe these balls will last longer with the other two Aussie-mix dogs .	1
So far , they 've held up well.Dogs really like them.Their humans like them as they do n't seem to get as slobber slimed as the rubber version .	1
Better than regular tennis balls . I do like the all rubber ones better though . They do n't hold the slime as much .	1
This is perfect for small breed dogs . My puppy loves it . They are easy for little dog to carry around and are hard to chew up .	1
I ordered three of these and this item is great , I own an 11 week old German Shepherd puppy that loves to chase a tennis ball and she grows bigger every single day . I was afraid that if I got a ball that was 'her ' size that I would not be able to keep it as she grows , but these seem to be just the right size , she can carry it around in her mouth just fine - she was carrying regular ones at 7 weeks ! They float and they also bounce great like a normal tennis ball , just bigger . Only time will tell about the durability , but these seem like the right size for large dog breeds to play fetch with in and out of the water .	1
Well how the old story goes , you cant get enough of a good thing . After ordering the Chuckit ( which came with only one ( 1 ) ball , I knew that I would need some back up ! Dogs love the game , and in time , I am sure i will figure out how to throw better !	1
Love them . They launch great and you can always find it because it 's so bright .	1
We have a lab/great dane mix who is obsessed with chewing and chasing balls . Big stong jaws and teeth on that girl [ Abby ] This is about the 10th different ball I have provided her and this is the best . Its been a couple of months and she is still in love with this ball . I think she broke through the ball with her teeth [ which she always does ] but she is keeping it intact . We put all her balls that survive in one pile and she will go and pick this one out for special attention . Bigger than a tennis ball , but not too big . very durable . easy to throw . she ca n't get it as slimy as a regular tennis ball . Its a good deal	1
I was surprised at how much my small ( 18 pound ) poodle likes this ball . I thought it might be too big for her . She loves to chase it and has picked up enough of the ball fuzz with her front teeth that she carries it by the fuzz . A nice dog toy . It will definitely get slobbery and soaked if a big dog plays with it , or if it goes into water .	1
My dog usually figures out a way to destroy each one of his toys but he pledges respect to his balls no pun intended.This are also better than tennis balls since he ca n't nibble and eat the fibers .	1
Get this ! These work with the chuck-it ! thrower thing and they are also really nice for general fetch when you 're just throwing the ball yourself . The only thing I would say is that these do tend to get more slobbery than your average tennis ball because they do n't have the fuzz on them ...	1
My small dog loves these things . They are nice and bright so he can see them and the felt material does n't peel off in chunks like the cheap balls do . They hold up alittle better which is nice so I do n't have to replace them as often .	1
My Labradoodle love this toy . It 's large enough to he ca n't swallow it and he has n't destroy any part of it yet . Made well .	1
My dog is obsessed with these balls and the launcher . They have a great bounce and last a pretty long time if you do n't let the dog chew too much.They would probably be too big for the smallest dogs though ( 2 '' diam ) . My dog is 12 pounds and they are on the big size for her.My dog adores her chuck it launcher and I like not having to touch the slobbery balls .	1
I absolutely love these balls , its small enough for my shihpoo puppy to play with and carry around in her mouth and strong enough to withstand her chewing . Definately will buy these again .	1
I have two bichon dogs ages 7 and 5 . My five year old has clicking joints and I thought I 'd try these . So far they 're still clicking but both dogs LOVE these treats . I think I 'll have to get joint food as well as the treats . Treats worked before alone . For the price and how the dogs like these I plan on reordering them . I break them in half most of the time since they are nice size even with the `` small '' size .	1
Both my 10-year old American Eskimo and 12-year old diabetic Miniature Pinscher really loves these treats . Their limps have decreased since I 've been giving them these chews .	1
These biscuits are crunchy and must be tasty as my dogs did enjoy them . They were not easy to break up to use as training treats , but they did enjoy the biscuits .	1
Great deal . I break them in half and feed to my pups as a treat .	1
First Impression : Nutri-Vet heard about my website ! They decided to send me a bag of their Peanut Butter flavored biscuits . Well what dog does n't love peanut butter ? ? ? Right now my hips are fine , but I 'm a young pup at a mere 13 months . I 'm sure as time progresses I 'll run into some sore joints , just like all large breed dogs do . So I 'm happy to know that there is something out there that can help , and tastes as good as this ! Conclusion : Tastes great , no animal bi-products , resealable bag , and it tastes like PB !	1
I bought this for my cats so when I go away for the night they still get fed in the morning . I was expecting the unit to be smaller than it is but overall it looks nicer than I expected and arrived very quickly . I am very happy with my purchase and I will update the review in a few months to let you know how it held up and if my cats figured out how to get to the food .	1
I have 2 cats and one is getting chubby , plus I 'm tired of always feeding them regularly . I needed this for when I was out of town anyway . This is great for feeding them a certain amount of food without overfeeding them . I do n't plan on using it for canned food with the ratings I saw on the site . Besides , it 's not vacuum packed to keep the canned food from spoiling and the ice packs are kind of cheap on the bottom -- -a gel that lasts longer than frozen water in them would work better and the manufacturer should have thought of that .	1
I very - VERY - nervously purchased this feeder for my cat , who has food security issues and is notorious for getting into the garbage and breaking into the cabinets to eat whatever he can get his mouth on . Seriously , I 'm kind of amazed he has n't figured out how to open the fridge yet . But he 's still young , so who knows.Because of his food issues , Mr. CrankyCat is extremely sensitive about his meal times . Meaning , he starts howling for dinner or breakfast about an hour before he knows it 's coming - just to make sure I do n't forget . Yeah , he 's a thoughtful guy , although that 's not usually how I feel about it at 5:30 am when he starts up.At first , I thought this thing was a piece of garbage - my cat quickly figured out how to twirl the top and boom , it was buffet time . Then I did something revolutionary - I read the directions . I know , crazy , right ? Turns out you have to snap the center part into place in TWO spots , not just one . If you miss one of them , any kitty with half his wits about him will figure out how to break into it . If you lodge the center part properly , it 's extremely secure . Secure enough that my guy has given up on trying to break into it , which is nothing short of a miracle.Yes , it 's a little annoying that you have to turn it on at precisely the time you want it to start it 's timer , but really - you 'd be feeding your cat at that time anyway , right ? So you have to fill a few more compartments at the same time , big whoop . It wo n't kill you.It took my cat a while to understand that I did not actually need to be present for the food to magically appear in the feeder . Now , he leaps like a reindeer on Christmas when he hears the motor whirring and is off like a shot . He even lets me sleep in a little later now , although he sits on my bedside table and watches me sleep until I get up . Creeper .	1
One star off because loading the battery into it is not unlike breaking into Fort Knox if Fort Knox were guarded by flying nanosharks . Reassembling it after you 've got the battery in place is slightly harder than that . Hopefully it gets easier with practice , and as some of the parts loosen up.It 's not loud . It 's fairly true-to-time , though I think it 's running in something like 6.75 hour increments rather than 6 . The best part , though , is that my cat somehow immediately figured out that this emotionless machine is now in control of his food , and that meowing at me would do nothing to change his feeding schedule . I 'm seriously cold when it comes to not rewarding that behavior - I 'll let him go to bed hungry before I 'll cave in and feed him to shut him up - but somehow he knew that yelling at me and getting fed must in some way be related . Now he thinks it 's in the hands of this little flattened and earless R2D2 , so we 're fine.Another major benefit is that he does n't think that R2D2 is going to yank the food away from him , like he always suspected I might , so he 's not wolfing his meals down and hoarking them back up.It 's a good product if you have a food-neurotic cat . It 's also going to be nice for when I have to go away on weekends.I already had a Tenergy battery charger that accommodates almost all sizes , including 9V , so I just bought two rechargeable 9V batteries . Those seem to be working just fine and that will resolve the constant expense/landfill issue .	1
I bought this because my older cats only consistently eat canned food so I needed a way to feed them if I go away for the weekend . This fit the bill . The ice packs keep the food fresh but they defrost as quickly as you 'd expect and certainly wo n't last all 6 feedings . Maybe about a day or so . But it 's better than nothing . I bought two of them and they both work well . I like the way you have 6 , 12 , or 24 hour options .	1
We bought this to use to feed our two adult cats whenever we go out of town for a few days . We chose this model because it was reasonably priced and holds enough food for up to six days . The unit has six pie-shaped ( wedge ) sections that you fill with food ; one section is always exposed , so it basically holds food for today plus five more servings . There is a switch that lets you select between 6 , 12 , or 24-hour serving intervals . At the preset interval , the lid advances to the next section . Each section holds enough dry food forup to two cats if you fill them up . There is no clock display on the unit ; there is a manual `` advance '' button on the unit ; whenever you press this , the lid rotates to the next opening and it resets the timer so that it will advance at the preset interval after this , or it will advance at the preset interval after you install the battery ( one 9-volt Alkaline battery ) . There are some small water tanks on the botton that are intended to be filled with water and frozen to keep canned food cold , but they are useless after more than a few hours . Overall , the unit does what it is supposed to do very well , without any complicated clock or timer settings to worry about , and it is large enough to hold a few days worth of food .	1
Good pet feeder , but it only lasts for five sessions . If you are leaving the house for longer too bad . I wish it could be plugged into the wall rather than a battery . You have to be around to know if the battery has gone bad . It is a bit hard to fill as the middle part needs to be pried up . I can do it with my fingers , but my girlfriend has to use a screwdriver as a lever .	1
My only complaint is that you need to pop the whole center out before you refill it , or you mess up the timer programming . It 's not super easy to pop back in , but not too hard either.When you pop the timer mechanism back in , make sure you line up the little prong on the timer with the notch on the plastic dish cover 's center hole . If you do n't , it wo n't fully lock into place and kitty might be able to get into the hidden pockets.My cats have stopped screaming at me when it comes close to dinner time ; instead , they just wait patiently for the dish to open . They took to it instantly !	1
I have had these feeders for 2 years now , and I still trust them . They are excellent for weight loss in those cats that cry for food all the time ( eventually kitty learns that you do n't give food , the feeders do ! ) . They are fairly loud ( which actually turns out to be good because they call the cats to eat ) . I have 2 and they stay in sync just enough to let them eat at the same time ( and so 1 cat does n't get all the food and the other gets none . ) They hold about 1/4 cup of dry kibble well . Anymore would be too much ( so maybe not a good option for dogs over 15 lbs or so ) . It has setting to rotate every 6 , 12 or 24 hours . A little green light blinks every few seconds to let you know that the battery is still good ( they take 9 volt batteries , and I have n't had to change them very often ) .Only 4 star review because I would rather have an 8 hour setting instead of a 6 hour setting . Also , do n't use it for canned food , even with the freeze tray-it just gets gross .	1
I just used it this weekend . I was gone for 4 days and i didnt have to worry about my cat eating all his food to fast . Im just not sure if the measurement for food might be a little small for a 24 hr period but thats why you have a choice of 6 or 12 hrs . Other than that i 'm satisfied completely	1
The Automatic Pet dish is a great thing to help out when you are away from home for a day or so . It is well made .	1
The variety of times available to set allowed us to go on vacation for 4 days and leave our cat at home . We used the dish for her treats and medicine ( she takes a powder med that she loves ) . We would just put the powder on her morning treat and she got her meds . Did n't have to worry about her eating it all on day one . I read reviews that said their cat destroyed the dish , but our cat had no problem .	1
As far as I can tell , it works as advertised . We only used it once while we were gone from the house and my cat did n't eat ( stress I think ) . We have to use wet food though and the ice pack did n't last as long as I 'd hoped . We were gone overnight and the ice was n't cold when we got home , we threw out the food that the cat did n't eat . So if someone can come in to change the ice , it would work . There must be a way to do it where it would last longer , but we 've just had someone come feed the cat instead . If someone knows of a way , please let me know !	1
I like this product , it works well for me . I use it when I am gone 2-3 days . I freeze about half the cat 's food ( in the tray ) and refrigerate the rest before putting it in . I also use the ice trays . This way I avoid the problem some people have had with the food going bad . The frozen portion thaws out slowly . When you prepare the tray , be sure the food is in the right slot and rotation so that the frozen food is accessed last .	1
Gave this to my daughter - she reports that it 's terrific - she 's glad to have the cat find food at 5 AM - those mornings of a cat standing on her , carrying on about food , are over - and she 's very glad !	1
This product is a great buy for the money . I shopped around a lot and could n't find anything to compare . This is the second one I bought . I 've had the first one almost a year and it 's still working . It is pretty quiet and the timer works well . My cats do n't try to break into it like others seem to do . It wo n't work with wet food for 6 days though because the ice will not keep ( since it 's just water in plastic ) but works well for a weekend away . It has eliminated me having to get up at 4:30am to feed the cats too !	1
I 've had this item for about a month and so far , it 's great . I have it set to offer a carefully measured portion of dry food every 6 hours to my cat who likes to overeat . This item keeps his portions under control and on a schedule , and keeps me from having to stop and feed him throughout the day . Since I have it set for every 6 hours , I reload the trays once a day to make sure he does n't miss any meals .	1
So far , So good - I 've had it about a month ( and I bought it on craigslist , in perfect condition for a very fair price ) . Like anything new in their environment , the cats were initially cautious , however , once they associated it with food ( ! ) , now they come right over when the hear the `` sound '' or when I 'm fiddling with it.I have two cats - V and L : L is fat and likes to eat and is not very athletic . This feeder is just for her and works perfectly for her . She has not even tried to bust it open , even though she sniffs it a little after I put the food in , she is satisfied that she can not reach the food and wanders away . L is a very simple cat.My other cat V is thin and just a nibbler , and is very curious and athletic , her seperate , open food dish is up high , so L ca n't reach it , and so V can nibble all day . If I put V 's food in this timed feeder , I have no doubt she would outsmart it and/or break it open in a day.Notes : *I found it easy to set . *Quiet , even in my small apt . ( but I live in the city , which is noisy itself ) . *I found it straightforward to pop apart and add food , just pay attention to the compartments so they are lined up properly for re-assembly ( ex : make sure you place food in the compartment that it will open to next ) . *It is a simple machine . The time settings are not very adjustable - 6 , 12 hr , etc . *I use it for an extra feeding when I work long days ( 12+ hrs ) - but I am not sure I 'd rely on it alone for a long weekend , but seems fine for an overnight . I prefer a live person to check in on my cats and apt anyway when I 'm away . *I use it for dry food only . I would definitely not use it for wet food . * Must stare at it until you see the green light flash , to check to see if it 's actually `` on '' . * A little big , very round , so I put it under the chair or table in kitchen so L has easy access to opening slot.Overall , I found it worth my time & money . Assess your cat and its abilities before purchasing this would be my tip .	1
My cats got infested with fleas and I had a hard time getting them under control , as a result I had many outbreaks of tapeworm in my three cats . The vet bills got expensive after awhile , and since I had learned to identify tapeworm infection , with some research , I deemed these safe . I am an infectious disease researcher myself , so I do have some experience . These do work , BUT please ALWAYS check with the veterinarian FIRST before you try to self treat your pets . The wrong treatment for the wrong diagnosis can lead to damaging consequences .	1
This is the same ingredient and strength as you get from your vet for tapeworms , but at a MUCH cheaper price . I live in Florida and have 7 cats I 've gotten from rescue and shelter places , so I 've seen tapeworms a few times . My vet knows I know what a tapeworm segment looks like when I see one , so I could get the medicine from her , but it costs a LOT more ( about 6 times more than this ! ) . Even the local pet store has this exact medicine but at about 3 times the cost you can find it here on Amazon . So , I was very happy to find it here . All it took was one dose to get rid of the tapeworms the 7th kitty came with . And , I still have a couple extra doses in case a tapeworm-infected flea gets in and one of the kitties eats it ( that 's how tapeworms are transmitted for anyone who might not know already ) .I will definitely buy this again here on Amazon if/when I need more ! Highly recommend this product .	1
I used this product and have not seen any more worms on my dear cat . Ive looked all over and found no remnants of them anywhere . Searching bedding and favorite cat spots around the house . I simply break the big pill in half and give it to the cat in two smaller doses at once . This way it goes down fast and easy for the cat . I recommend this product for tape worms in cats . No problem .	1
My cat has gotten tape worm a few times now from being infested with fleas ( when a cat gets a flea in its mouth that is infected with tapeworm they get it ) and nothing worked ! I tried a few different tablets and the only thing I found worked to get rid of them was taking my cat to the vet for a shot which was pricey . Just from taking 1.5 of these pills , my cat 's worms were gone and for a fraction of the price of taking them to the vet ! Would definitely buy these again if needed !	1
I always keep these on hand because I have cats that pester me to go outside . Naturally they kill things and pick up tapeworms . If I see one I give them a pill and its done . Love this product ! ! !	1
all but one my cats got a pill-one doe sn*t let me ! ! ! Think they worked fine , although cats probably get another worm carriage so rapidly	1
It works very effectively . I had one of my cats with the tale , tale signs of tapeworms , the rice pods ( eggs ) in its fecal matter . The gas it passed was enough to make me gag . It was quite unpleasantly odiferous . After 1 day of administration of the medicine , she passed a tapeworm about 9 inches long . So I treated the rest of my cats . They are all fart free . Indications are , if one has tapeworms , the rest do too . Now , time to get some good flea meds for them .	1
I have bought this product several times . I think I finally resolved the problem even though it took moving to a new house . The product works great . My cats are pretty sensitive to medicine but they have no issues taking this .	1
I have been using the Tape Worm Tabs for several years . I have one cat that is not a house cat , but prefers to be outdoors and only comes in for a few hours a day . He is my problem cat as he does not get along well with my other cats and prefers to be alone and loves to hunt . As a result of his wanderings he does not eat properly and this is the third time in his eleven years that he has gotten worms . Tape Worm Tabs were recommended to me by my vet and I have been using them ever since . They work really well and it is not too hard to give to the cat . Two tabs work well with one dose given and then a couple of weeks later a second dose and you are done.The only thing that I do n't understand is why only 3 tablets in the bottle . Not a big deal but it would seem more logical to put either 2 tabs or 4 tabs in a bottle . Other than that , the tabs do the job and do it well .	1
Wanted to try on my own to get rid a my cat 's tapeworm . I had seen the white pieces of the worm on her rectum . It was 3 pills . The first one was wasted , mainly my fault . The second one was given in a really good treat . I think she ate most of it . Have not seen any tell-tell signs on her rectum since then so I am assuming it worked . The delivery was very fast . I will use them again .	1
Had 2 cats with tapeworms and after using these pills they were gone . It also had to do with getting rid of fleas too as both seem to go hand in hand with each other . If you have a cat with worms this will work like a charm	1
I used this on all three of my cats and have not needed to retreat them . I will keep it on hand just in case it is needed .	1
I had previously washed Goldie with Flea & Tick shampoo and after that applied Frontline Plus control . Thereafter began to notice like little grains of rice near and around her anus as well as in her hair there.During this time , she has been eating chicken and brown rice dry cat food with a little wet food . Also , when she went to the bathroom her stool was hard and no diarrhea . No upchucks either . I had previously washed Goldie with Flea & Tick shampoo and after that applied Frontline Plus control . Thereafter saw this half-inch long thin like rice underneath her right eye and I flicked it away with thinking . So , when I told my mother about it , she said I should have smashed /killed it because it was a worm . After that I started researching online with various websites and found out a lot of information about Goldie 's situation which was mild considering other reviews about types of worms . Realizing she had tape-worms , began comparing prices and products and eventually settled on this product with consultation from a Vet 's assistant via phone . Read the instructions and applied them as soon as possible . I smashed the tablet into her food with some fish oil and she ate it all . Afterwards , she went to sleep and I did n't hear or see her till the following day Tuesday the 7th with no outward visible signs of fleas or worms . Thanks to the company and Amazon for an affordable product with great benefits for concerned people like me . Greatly appreciated ! ! ! ! !	1
These are great pills and the price is unbelievable ! I am back to order more for the rest of my cats . Thank you .	1
I have purchased this product for my cat for many years . Living out in the country it is essential to have the proper wormer medications on hand . A+	1
First of all , this is heavy and bulky . Those two items are why this is a 4 star item instead of 5 . Having said that , I had no problem lifting or using it.This ramp is superior in every way to another ramp I have . ( The other ramp I have is the Solvit 62337 - it has a sandpaper type finish that is hard to get up if the incline is too steep ... say , in a standard SUV . My dog also FELL off of it NUMEROUS times , hence why I purchased this one ) .The PetSTEP ramp has a wonderful rubbery texture that makes it easy to walk up and down for a dog . It is a bi-fold ramp versus a sliding accordian type , but it needs to be for as sturdy as it is . It stows nicely in the back seat or propped up against the wall in the garage . The material on this ramp alone makes it worth the price !	1
I purchased this ramp a little over 10 years ago when I bought an SUV and did not want to lift my elderly 65 lb dog into the rear . He caught on right away and this worked so well he never missed his car . I got 2 puppies 8 years ago and still have the SUVs - did n't want to damage their puppy legs so have used this right along every single day into their older years ! It has held up remarkably well and I can easily fold it and stow it in the back when it is not being used.This has probably been the only item I have ever used on a daily basis and still have as much need as I had the first day I bought it ! I have recommended this item to friends and they seem to think a ramp is ramp . Some of their ramps are too steep ( short ) for an SUV - some are too narrow for our 65 lb chows , and some get either slippery in the rain or hot in the summer . And some are hard to put away . This ramp does n't have any of those limitations . I am pleased with this purchase and hope you will be too . And FYI - I paid about the same price 10 years ago !	1
No assembly , flip open and use it . Works on my Toyota mini van , fold up when done , and lift using the built in recessed handle on the side . I am a guy and can carry with one hand like butta	1
First , let me say that I 've only had this ramp for approximately one week , and normally I do n't believe in posting reviews so quickly . I planned to post a review of this product in about a month , but had to post this early in case it helped someone else in our situation with their dog . So here is/was our situation . Out of the blue one day while on vacation , my dog screamed in pain when walking up the 3 steps to our motorhome . It was so heartbreaking and she ended up at a pet ER while we were traveling . She was put on pain medication until we returned home . After many unsuccessful vet visits , it was determined by a specialist that our beagle has luxating patellas ( kneecaps that pop out of joint ) . She would always walk fine on level ground where no steps were involved . So we had been carrying her inside her metal crate up and down our outside deck steps so she could do her thing ! A 25 lb . beagle AND a metal crate that has to weigh at least 15 lbs conservatively ! This had been going on since this past May when she experienced her first incident of obvious pain when going up steps . I looked and researched many ramps , but this one was the only one made with a rubbery surface , although I think the entire ramp is some sort of plastic , but with incredibly good traction . I did what another reviewer suggested , laid it flat on the floor inside of the house and within a day , with some coaxing and food , she easily walked back and forth over it that way . Well , today , I decided to put it outside on the steps down to our patio , and did n't think she 'd take to going down the ramp , much less up the ramp , right away . Once again , food did the trick ! She did n't even hesitate , and walked down the ramp to retrieve the food , and back up again to retrieve the food , as my husband stood at one end , and I the other . So in less than a week , she has really taken to it much more quickly than I expected . So if anyone is on the fence about it , I highly recommend it , and the weather probably wo n't hurt it since it 's made of hard plastic and rubber . It has one little latch to fold it shut , but I just carry it sideways folded under my arm like a suitcase to move it if needed . It will really prove to be a back saver for both my husband and myself !	1
I bought this for my Bernese Mountain Dog . Since they are prone to all types of joint issues , I thought I would start early trying to protect him . Diesel is 8.5 months old . I have a Dodge Diesel 2500 pick up and they are quite tall . Diesel never wanted to go in by himself so that would leave me to hoist his large 80lb butt into the truck . Then after jumping down he would sometimes limp and was always very nervous about jumping out . So this ramp fixed all that . After receiving it I set it up into the truck and called him into the garage . He looked at it , grinned at me and up he went , then down , then up ... you get the picture . I know this is not the correct way to train , but when Diesel 's in the mood he catches on real quick . He loves rides so he is always impatient for me to set it up so he can get in the truck . But he does manage to wait with great distress . He climbs quickly up the ramp and I am happy that it has a non-slip surface that is permanent not stuck on , and the sides remind him not to step off . It fits ok on the lip of the underneath part of my truck seats if the seats are in the upright position . It 's tight but it fits . This thing is heavy when you are trying to unfold it and hold onto a large puppy . The weight is the only downfall , but it 's also what makes this sturdy and built so well . The pinch factor is always there too , but if it bends it goes to reason it can pinch you . Be careful and you should be fine . All in all it 's a great ramp and remains sturdy while in use .	1
We have three large dogs and they use the ramp with ease . Might have to assist pushing their behind up the first few times , but they get the picture quickly . Saves their shoulders ! It folds easily and fits snugly onto the back end of my SUV ( Porsche Cayenne 2011 ) .	1
This ramp has pros and cons . I used it for several months on my front steps ( placed over 2 deep steps ) with my 75lb . alaskan husky who has unsteady drooping hind legs due to a health condition . It did n't work with my car , so I ca n't attest to using it for that purpose.Cons , first : -It 's not really wide enough for a large dog with an unsteady gait ( unless guided very carefully ) . However , if you are a DIY'er and are placing this in one stationary spot , you could likely attach boards along the sides to prevent falling . We had a few scary moments with this ramp because of the width and low sides.-The ridges are deep ( deep enough that they really do prevent the dog from sliding down , but also made it uncomfortable for my dog to go up , as very uneven surfaces are hard for him to maneuver ) . Wish the ridges were a bit more shallow , as the non-slip surface seems powerful on its own.-No bottom supports ( not an issue for small dogs , but for larger dogs , the fact that there are no supports and is hinged in the middle means that there is some give when the dog walks on it - this made my dog a little nervous , but not enough that it would prevent me from purchasing it ) . This is more of a FYI than a con.-I left mine in one spot , so this was irrelevant for me , but it is fairly heavy ( this coming from a small-framed woman ) .Pros : -The rubber feet at the top seemed to hold well.-Folds for storage and transporting.-The rubberized non-slip surface is awesome ! ! ! I used it during the winter ( and even regularly heated water in a tea kettle to pour over the surface for melting snow/ice ) and it performed wonderfully.-This is superficial , but I love that it is khaki-colored , as it blended in better with my concrete steps and was less obvious than darker colored ones.Eventually I ended up building my own custom ramp , only because the ridges on this ramp were too deep for my dog . If they had a slightly longer model with the same non-slip surface and shallower ridges , I would buy another in a heartbeat !	1
I had to return a telescoping pet ramp I got through Amazon because the scratchy , ping pong paddle surface did n't work for my 30 pd dog . She literally slipped and left scratched marks on it . This one has ridges that are close together and the surface feels like a synthetic rubber . I set it up and put a couple pieces of kibble at the top of the ramp set at a 45 degree angle and my 8 year old dog scrambled right up it , ate the kibble and laid down on it . I had to tell her & # 34 ; table & # 34 ; to get her up and onto the table . She had knee surgery earlier this year and this would have helped a great deal with the car and the grooming table as I have a bad back making it a challenge to lift her that far . I do n't need it to get her down but may try it to get her ready for the back of the SUV . It is 2.5 pds heavier than the other and the sides are relatively thin plastic as opposed to the fiber glass with the telescoping one . The box states that it weighs 18.5 pds which differs from the description a bit . This one is harder to move around and there really is only one length . It 's rubber feet left a mark on white berber carpet that the vacuum removed . A friend of mine has this ramp and has used it for a variety of other uses .	1
Our 90 pound husky just had ACL surgery and I bought this so he could get in and out of the SUV . It is a great ramp , easy to use , very sturdy , a cinch to unfold and very lightweight . The tread is very good and provides for sure footing . We have used it outside over a few steps for him and it has been left outside in the rain overnight . It is plastic , so being outside does n't hurt it and the water runs right off it . I am really happy with it .	1
This is a great product but too heavy and cumbersome for most women to use without risk of back injury . While this product has been a lifesaver , I 'm currently looking for a lighter product that will work as well as this one . If you have a suggestion , please leave me a comment.I use this ramp with a hatchback and for storage am able to stand it on its side against the door using a bungy cord to keep it upright . This saves a lot of room and allows me to carry 3 large dogs in my hatchback with rear seats folded . I previously tried putting it behind front seat but it was awkward to get in and out with back seats folded down.On the plus side , the ramp is sturdy , easy to clean , and the dogs have had no problem using it . I used the training instructions for my dog , but his companions were motivated just by dog bones .	1
Sturdy , wide , big , long -- perfect for my 80lb . dog -- > Subaru Forrester . I wanted something that I could stand and walk on to show our dog that it could be trusted -- and sure enough , it is . Our dog isn ' too old to require this , but I wanted to start using it as trying to teach some dogs to use ramps can be difficult ( and the last thing I wanted to do was to teach him how to use it when he was injured ) . He is n't injured , but it took about 4 weeks to truly get him comfortable with using it . FYI , I always stand on it myself to make sure it 's not wobbly or so the middle does n't slightly buckle upwards ( make sure the top part of the steps is FLAT as possible on the rim of the car/fender ) . It 's a bit heavy , but it truly is solid and constructed well . Also , as others may have written , closing this must be done carefully . Not sure if they changed the design since when I got it ( about a year ago ? ) but you could lose a finger or two when closing this thing .	1
This one is a good quality product sturdy and hard . Difficult to open it . It is too big for my SUV Grand Cherokee . I wish it was holder to 3 piece not two and wider . I do n't have much experience in pet ramps this one is good but did not make my life much easier than before as much as I wished for .	1
The plastic is thick enough not to flex or twist , and the shape of the end is good as it sits on the tailgate . Very stable. [ ... ]	1
Bought used - opted for this version of a ramp for my pack of aging herding dogs - 50 # Aussie/BCs and a 75 # Bouvier des Flandres - who were beginning to tear my aging back . Made in USA from heavy duty plastic by the same folks who made the floor mats I got for the truck ( Weather Tek ) . Folds easily . The weight is necessary for the sturdiness I need ( plan to throw in the truck bed when not being used ) . No metal to rust . Textured ramp built in ( no peeling ) . Altogether the ramp is an ideal product I was very pleased to buy at 60 % retail cost .	1
Toby , our 90-lb `` pup '' , got too old to get in and out of the SUV on his own . The Petstep saved the day . Easy to deploy , easy to fold and stow . You WILL crush your fingers ONCE while folding it up , but only once . Sorta like a child and a hot stove . Live and learn . I do n't really see any way to redesign the edge to avoid this without making the Petstep more difficult to use . By the 3rd day I was able to deploy it from the back of the SUV in about 5 seconds , and stow it in about 10 seconds.From a dog psychology standpoint , I found that even after using it for a year , Toby still wanted to leap off the ramp when he got halfway down . And his legs were not able to handle that , so I had to lead him down the ramp by holding his collar so he would n't try to jump off . In the end , it was prostate cancer that did him in . The Petstep is now stored in the garage and I 'm sure we 'll be using it again as soon as Lucy gets too old to jump in and out of the SUV on her own . But she 's only 6 so she has a few more good years I think .	1
Bought this for our 50-pound dog , for use following surgery , to reduce the risk of post-op hernia . Trained him on it prior to surgery , since he 's used to jumping in and out of the van . Dog navigated it just fine , even in post-anesthesia haze : - ) . Also used indoors to get him on and off the grooming table . All surfaces are coated , so there 's nothing to scratch the vehicle 's paint . When folded , ramp kept closed with a coil spring , protected with a bit of clear tubing . Simple solution that works just fine . Notch in rails well-placed to carrying when folded . Rubber pads help resist slipping off the bumper when the dog is walking the ramp . Definitely recommend to dog friends .	1
Our older dog sometimes has trouble jumping into the SUV , so we bought this for him . It was very easy to train both of our two dogs to use this ramp . We have had the opportunity to use this when we go on our long hikes , we are out for hours and have two very tired dogs when we get back . They walk right up the ramp with no problems.I have had the ramp for about two months and I would recommend this ramp as it is easy to use and to train a dog to use it . We keep it in our back seat to always have it handy . I look forward to using this ramp for years to come .	1
looked into something that was portable AND would hold up in our winter snows . Been very pleased with this product . Following their instructions , I got my dog to use it within a few hours . It has been out in all sorts of weather and seems to be holding up well . I like that it will not rust , folds easily and quickly , and has rubber strips to give them traction . Unlike other similar products , this rubber strip seems to be the superior product . The box it arrived in was damaged but maybe that was it was so bulky . It was in pristine condition . This is helping my dog tremendously with her mobility issues .	1
This is a truly great tool and I 'm now ordering two more -- one more as backup for the dogs , one for us . We live in a tick intense area . I 've tried everything , including extremely fine tweezers , with some success , but ONLY this small spoon remover gets the whole tick , every time , mostly with no visible after effect ( that depends on how embedded the tick has gotten -- regardless , the tool removes the WHOLE tick ) .	1
Pros : Quickly removes ticks from my dog with their head intactHolds ticks in placeCons : Takes a small amount of practice to properly use.You can do the same thing with tweezers with a little extra effort and attention.Often the ticks get stuck in the crack and you will need a toothpick like object to fish them out.Other Thoughts : Many users say they ca n't remove ticks until after they have fed , I did not experience this . I can remove new ticks as easily as fed ones.The spoon , as I call it , is made of cheap plastic , but feels pretty sturdy since the plastic is fairly thick . It should n't break unless stepped on or abused . It is small enough to be easily stepped on if dropped however.I would recommend this and will probably buy another once I get drunk and step on this one .	1
Love this tick remover ! I lived in an area with tons of ticks and my dogs were always getting them . It was disgusting to try and pick them off by hand , and using tweasers was gross because it squeezes the tick and leaves the head half the time . Then the whole match thing never worked for me either.I found this tick remover at the counter of a pet store- took it home to test it out- and voila ! Works great . I 've had no problems , and it works effortlessly every time for me . Just have to `` scoop '' the tick and the tool actually lifts the tick out ( the whole tick ! no head left behind ) . Once you get the right scoop technique it will never fail you.Such a stupid idea really , it 's basically a teaspoon with a notch cut out , but I could n't live without it ! ( & p.s . I have a Siberian Husky with super long hair , and a Great Dane with short hair - so it works great on everyone ) .	1
This is a great product , although I have n't had to use it yet , it is great to have on hand ! !	1
Very easy to use and you do n't have to worry about not getting the entire tick out . Far better than tweezers .	1
Follow the simple instructions and you will be pulling ticks out whole every time.We got this for my Mom who lives in Mississippi , Tick Capital of the World ! She has had no problem removing ticks with this tool . It works like a charm.We highly recommend this tool for anyone who has to deal with ticks in their yard or while hunting or fishing.We found out about it at a hunting safety class , where the instructor recommended it .	1
My dog is a tick magnet , have bought collars and sprays , but still gets them . This simple spoon works great , get the entire tick out every time.Best to pinch the skin around the tick , to better get at the tick .	1
Awesome product ! I have two cats that bring home ticks all the time . This product gets all of them ! No matter what size the tick is , I always get that satisfying `` popping '' sound of the tick coming out , head and all . The v shape of the ticked off keeps the tick contained until you take it out , ensuring it will not crawl away before you can dispose of it . Yes , it works on humans too !	1
I got this for my kitties and all but one love it . Theyre very very picky . Have been feeding them purina one chicken and rice and purina indoor formula . One of them ( the one who doesnt love it ) loves the indoor formula . I have one that eat hills prescription diet k/d so I figured they would like this since they try and eat hers all the time . Im hoping it will be loved by the other over time . Just started giving it to them today .	1
I ordered Hill 's Science for my 2 cats earlier but the nuggets were too large & hard for them to eat..I received an e-mail suggesting the Adult Optimal Care . Both love it & have no problems with size of hardness . Thank you for the help !	1
Science Diet , I use for many years . My Cat is nutritionally satisfied and the food goes a long way . The food makes my cat coat soft , and shiny . The price is higher compare to the other brands you find in the store , but it is worth it . The science diet makes a huge difference in the general well being of my cat .	1
All of my cats like it . It is a quality dry food . Of course , always keeps clean fresh water available at all times .	1
This cat food contains a lower level of magnesium than the `` supermarket '' cat foods . Low magnesium levels help to prevent urethra problems , especially in male cats due to their more narrow urethra . I would rather pay the higher price for this brand of cat food than bring my cats to an emergency vet in the middle of the night because their urinary tract gets blocked , not to mention the aggravation caused to the cat . Other brands of low magnesium cat food include Iam 's and Nutro-Max . Hill 's Science Diet food is round-shaped , rather than `` hooked '' , which makes it easier for one of my older tooth-challenged cats to swallow .	1
My two cats age 5 and 18 , yes , 18 love this food . My 18 year old Siamese can be very picky but loves her Science Diet .	1
Both my cats love Hills Science Diet food ! It 's more expensive , but worth every penny ! I used Iams for years , but lately they seemed to be vomiting more so I decided to switch . Glad I did . I may still try & # 34 ; Blue Buffalo & # 34 ; at least once . I 've read great things about this food also .	1
I use both this and the & # 34 ; light & # 34 ; dry cat food for my two cats . I mix them together and they like that a lot.The price is much better than I can buy locally , and delivery was free thanks to my Prime account.I will be feeding my cats Science Diet cat food from now on .	1
We have a kitty with some urinary issues . He developed unprinted crystals , a precursor to kidney stones ( vet said it probably felt like peeing shards of glass ) . He was certainly letting us know , so nobody was happy . ( Of course , I was glad he let us knows and even happier when we got it worked out ) .Here 's what we learned . Cat food has to have a balance of specific vitamins/minerals and if the amounts are out of whack , cats are very prone to urinary problems . We had switched to Spot 's Stew , an & # 34 ; all natural & # 34 ; food , and it gave our little dude some major problems . Apparently Science Diet is one of the best companies for studying and developing formulas for urinary issues , and behold , we have had NO issues since switching . Can I get an amen ? ! ? ! ? The price point on the big bag is also excellent , if you do much comparison shopping in the stores . So , everybody is happy ! !	1
So far I have been mixing the Hill 's Science dry food with what my catshave been eating and gradually increasing the amount of Hill 's Science.The cats have been eating it so I assume they like it ! ! !	1
My cat who has stomach issues does just fine on this food . And that 's awesome .	1
picky cat gobbles this down . I have to hide the bag or he tries to get into it .	1
Great product for my four cats . I love ordering from Amazon subscribe and save . Always cheaper then pet store or vet and even nicer heavy bag of food arrives at front door in a box . No dragging 30 pound+ bags in and out of car . With super saver shipping it is free !	1
I found two young female cats wondering around my neighborhood and eventually caught them , their fur was rough and dirty from malnourishment and the harsh weather . After a bath and some good science diet cat food , they 're as healthy as can be ! Their fur is soft and their teeth are so healthy ! I also leave a bowl of science diet cat food for the other two feral cats that do n't want to be caught . I will not be taking my two new kitty cats off this food , they love it to much !	1
each time I give up on the high cost and feed my cats another brand , it takes less than 2 weeks to see the difference in their coats and weight . They eat way more of the lesser brands and they poop 80 % causing litter demand to double . They eat much less on Science Diet . I have a personal kitty rescue ranch , no help from anywhere so must watch every penny and cut corners every way possible . I find this to be the ultimate food ... even if it smells bad . : )	1
Our kittens happily scarfed this food down and why should n't they ? ? It smells better than any other cat food I 've ever had and their behavior has gotten much better . They are less lethargic and the morsels are perfect for their developing teeth . We will most definitely continue to buy Hills Science Diet for all of our pets needs.Pros : Made without all the junkHappy Kitties=Happy Owners ! ! All the good stuff your cats needCons : A tad pricey but sooooo worth it ! !	1
This is my cats favorite food . It is the same price as the top box stores and it gets delivered to my front door .	1
This is the same food I get from the fancy pet stores , except I spend less and it comes to my door !	1
Got this for our slightly overweight 5-yr old cat and our bordering-on overweight 9-mo old kitten . I will be looking into a weight control one next , but it 's been great - my 5yo has no teeth and she throws these kibbles down no problems , though : )	1
My kittens like the taste and it seems to do nice things to their fur , it 's also possible their poop is n't as strong smelling , though I was using a good cat food before I tried this one as well so it 's not as noticeable a difference .	1
I was looking for a healthy and yummy puppy can food since my puppy is a picky eater . After opening the first can I new that this was the right product ! She sat next , patiently waiting for her yummy meal . I am happy and she is happier !	1
I purchased for my new pups . I have been a long time fan/customer of science diet for 11 years . My babies love the food ! ! Actually cheaper online them in stores . THanks ! !	1
Prompt shipment on the cans ! Used these for my pregnant girl at the end of pregnancy ... she liked it pretty well . It is a bit dry and dense . Firm stools though and no problems.Pups have firm stools and little smell as well .	1
I have tried several dog foods for my puppy . this is the only brand and type that he seems to love . my puppy had an issue with eating his poo , so i tried all these other brands and he would continue to eat it . i finally put him on this and sucess ! he stopped eating his poo and he eats all his food . i have also given him other science diet wet food with the meat and gravy but he doesnt like it . of note , this food will make your dogs poo extra stinky . which is good so he wont eat it but bad for when you pick it up .	1
I have always been a Science Diet fan . My puppy loved this chicken flavor entree . I also have an elderly dog that was not wanting to eat anything- until he smelled this chicken formula . He started eating it , and we have been able to move him back to dry food .	1
Both my girls love this mixed in with their food . ( I 'm sure they 'd love it more NOT mixed with the kibble , but they tolerate the kibble just be eat this . ) Great service , reasonably priced . I 'd gladly use seller again .	1
I do n't use small cans like Fancy Feast , so I can not comment on those . However , I like these because they LAST . I bought them at a pet food store which no longer carries them , probably because they are so expensive.Except for a lid I bought at least 15 years ago labelled Sargeant 's , these are the sturdiest . The more flimsy ones always end up getting a crack in them and are not always tight.For me , the 4 stars , not 5 , is because they seem expensive . However , on Amazon , it seems that most of the can covers are more expensive than you would want to pay . It 's the S & H that is outrageous .	1
I have four cats , one on a special diet and have to divide up both 3 oz and 5.5 oz cans . I tried putting contents in glass and plastic containers but that takes time and impatient cats do n't like to wait while I put away their companion 's food away . Two clicks and its done . The food stays fresh which is good because special food is expensive . I appreciate the versatility in sizes as it even works on dog food cans too .	1
I read the reviews on this and was hesitant to give it a try because of reviewers who said it was so hard to get the off once they got it on . These lids are very hard to find so I decided to give it a try and , for me , it worked great . It easily went on and came off of 5.5 and 3 oz cans of cat food and 12.5 oz cans of dog food . However , as one reviewer pointed out , after they 've been in the fridge they clan be a little harder to remove . Running a little hot water over the lid while it 's still on the can restores the flexibility and it will pop right off . They 're great . I 'm ordering more .	1
I have used these for almost 2 years on all the sizes of food cans that my cats and dog eat and have n't had any problems at all . They are a stiffer plastic than the single size lids , but they still work well . I have found that you do have to push down more on the smallest size cans to get the seal though . Anyway , I have a couple sets because it is so easy to have a lid that works on them all .	1
My kitten eats plenty of wet food , and was on 3oz cans for quite some time . This cover sealed those cans , and it was not difficult to remove . A lot of people have reviewed this stating it 's too hard to remove from a 3oz can - if it were any easier I 'd be worried that it was n't sealed . The coolest thing about this cover is that now that my kitten is on 5.5oz cans , the same exact cover can seal her food.Only negative is that I was fooled by the photo into thinking I was getting two covers - you only get one .	1
These lids are awesome . They fit every size of cat food cans that I have and my dog food ones too . What a great idea to put so many different sizes under one lid ! I did not read that it fit many different sizes of cat food cans . I bought this because I thought it was a cute lid . Thanks for this cool idea . What a nice surprise ! Fast delivery and good packaging .	1
My dog loves this product ! Ca n't really go wrong with this ... . a good tip : put some puppy toothpaste on there and it 'll help them brush better : )	1
My miniature schnauzer LOVES this toy . This is my second one buying ( not because it broke- because it has gotten so nasty ) He drags it with him EVERYWHERE . We have to make him drop this toy . The only downside is if you have hardware floors , this toy WILL scratch them so be careful ... My boxer likes this toy as well but not as much because her teeth are alot smaller . I would recommend it for a dog with bigger teeth . I have noticed an improvement in his gum strength . I have had to brush his teeth less since getting this toy and he LOVES it ! ! ! I can not say enough how much my dog loves this toy . Also , while crate training he used to chew his bed , but once we got this toy he has not touched his bed . If we leave his toy out of his crate , his bed is chewed again ... ... .. LIFE SAVER ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! Love Nylabone , love this dinosaur !	1
My dogs wo n't touch this toy . I do n't know if it 's the strong odor or they just do n't like the feel in their mouths . I will see to it that another dog gets it . I think it 's a good toy . But I 'm not a dog . Thank you .	1
Both puppies enjoyed this toy and it was great for keeping their attention off chewing other household items- we would purchase again .	1
I have had this dog toy for about five months and it is going strong . I have two motivated chewers who have demolished a household in their time , yet this still is around . I would love it except that is has become all jagged and gross . However , I guess after being chewed up for months it would be strange if it wasnt all jacked up . Very good for medium size mouths and up , not for small dogs	1
Our dino looks slightly different than the picture , but my little maltese still loves it . Had it for about a month and he picks it up and runs with it , chews on it and then puts it down . For some reason this is a toy he goes to when he gets really worked up to come down .	1
Nylabones are a long-lasting , calorie-free , relatively safe , & fun chew toy for your dog . And , the dinosaur designs are adorable .	1
This is a fun toy to have around and supposedly it cleans teeth so that 's a bonus . This toy is not as well loved by our two Bostons as the nylabone wishbone but they do like it . It is very durable . I will warn you that stepping on this thing barefoot is very unpleasant . But maybe your dogs do n't leave their toys in all kinds of unexpected places without warning . ; - )	1
We purchased this Nylabone for our short hair pointer puppy . I was disappointed when it arrive and was not the dinosaur I had hoped we would get ( dinosaur varies ) . We received the stegosaurus . However , our puppy LOVES this chew toy . She has many toys of all types and this one is one of her favorite go tos !	1
My dog got this last year for christmas and its still around and intact , I was worried when after a few days of having it I noticed it had blood on it but he is an obsessive chewer and that soon stopped . Some people have complained about the heads or tails breaking off but mine is still intact . He loves this thing . The only issue I have with it is that now all the little spots on it are sharp and he likes to leave it right in my walking path . I ca n't help but think he does it on purpose .	1
My dogs are aggressive chewers and often go through toys quickly . Anything Nylabone is generally good and I really like these Dinosaurs . They wear well and do n't ever have large dangerous pieces chipping off . Definitely recommend this product .	1
This is a very cute toy . My dog loves it and it was bought for Christmas and it is now March and it is still going strong . It was not the Dinosaur pictured but it is a dinosaur .	1
This was recommended to me by a shopper in PetCo when she saw my Pit Bull . She had a Pibble as well and she said her dog loved them . I remember seeing it on Amazon before for much cheaper than what they were selling it for at PetCo so I ordered it.It is not my dog 's `` go to '' toy but she does chew it often.I had tried other nylabone products that my dog just would n't bother with so I was pleased that she seems to like this one.I 'd say go ahead and give it a try ... iit 's cheap enough and you might luck out like I did.I would n't pay too much attention to the reviewers that claim it breaks their dogs teeth . I question their responsibility as a dog owner rather than the chew toy . Those are the type of dog owners that probably do n't monitor their dogs when they give them a toy . I only allow my dog about 20 minutes with any given chew toy . No one should let their dog sit there and chew on something all day..especially unattended	1
This was one of the first toys we ordered our puppy and it is still one of her favorites . Even though it is almost unrecognizable at this point . But she still loves it . And it has helped keep her from chewing up my shoes ; ) )	1
I have two rescue doggies , who I have mentioned many times in my other reviews . They 've both got anxiety issues , which cause them to chew and misbehave if anything goes off schedule ( usually in our house it does n't , but if I stop at the store on the way home rather than going straight home , something is gon na get eaten ) . Because of this , we try to keep a variety of toys , especially durable ones , available to them in their toyboxes . This has seemed to help immensely , and they realize that if they 're going to chew , we would much prefer that they go to their box rather than our couch or shoes.One product that we consistently stock in their toyboxes would be anything Nylabone . They are definitely durable , and while it is noticeable that they 've been chewed , they do n't shed chunks of plastic like other chewable type toys do - this gives me a huge peace of mind . The boys also really like the nubs , and will sometimes just sit there and nibble at them . They 're both large breed dogs with very strong jaws ( one is a Great Dane/Lab and the other is a Boxer/Rottweiler/Pitbull/Chow mix ) , and these have held up marvelously . Definitely recommended !	1
High quality item - chew toy is a little too large for my 10 pound dog . Otherwise , exactly as described .	1
This is one of the 2 toys that have survived my puppy 's teething phase . The rest are history . I have a female lab retriever , and this is the toy she prefers when her teeth hurt . She does n't chew on it hard enough to break it , but you can tell it 's losing its texture . I think it 's a great toy that will last a long time = ) UPDATE 3/17/2014 : This is one of the few toys that has survived my lab retriever ! It 's losing its texture ( from all the biting ) but it hasnt been broken : ) Very recommended !	1
I own a chewer . If left to her own devices she will chew metal pipes ... and has . This thing is durable as hell , but for some reason not the go to toy . It 's pretty good ; it holds up . But there are better nylabones on the market .	1
My dogs love this dino chew . They chew on it all the time . Its there fav chew I have got them of all the chewable bones I got them	1
They love this thing !	1
Our mega chewer loves this dino chew toy . The head and feet are smoothed out , but the rest is still in tact .	1
My dog destroys ANY toy he gets , so I have to be very picky when I do buy him something . Most Nylabone products are safe ( we have had some bad experiences with some ) but this one is great ! I have a puggle who is 30 lbs and he just loves this . I was happy to see a new toy added by Amazon in the nylabone division , and it is a great price . At $ 5 , I can replace these often enough when my dog starts to wear them down . He loves the dinosaur however , he carries it around with him everywhere !	1
its a nylabone ( i.e . lasts a long time ) and a good size . I think dogs enjoy chewing on it because of the different shapes/angles .	1
I have never been disapointed with a Nylabone dog toy . These dinosaur ones last forever and hold their shape well ( so they do n't look all chewed up right away ) . I highly recommend this toy for dogs who like to chew . We 've bought two of them for our pug/Boston terrier mix .	1
Our pup loves to play with and then chew on something . This is a long lasting toy and dental chew . I have no fear that he will choke on too big a piece of it . He can gnaw or chew on it .	1
I was very disappointed in the `` regular '' Nylabones - my 20 pound dogs chewed them into sharp , dangerous chunks within a matter of minutes . I was wary of Nylabone products after that , but the durable ones have turned out to be great , and I 'll only buy durable from now on . My dogs like the bone-shaped durable Nylabones , but they LOVE these dinosaurs . They never seem to get tired of chomping on them . They do wear down , but slowly and in tiny pieces that appear to be harmless . After about a month of three dogs working on two dinosaurs , the toys are missing their heads , but there 's plenty more to chew on . Their irregular shape makes them easy to hold onto and fun to go at from different angles . My house will never be without these things .	1
I gave this to my mastiff and she loves chewing on it . She has n't been able to break it up or chew any of it off , so it is good for dogs that are aggressive chewers . Would buy another one of these .	1
My dogs really like this toy , there is something about this dinosaur chew that they all like it , so I got another one because they keep taking it away from the dog that is chewing on it .	1
the durablty of this stood up to the puppy chewing . I would buy this product again . It is stronger and will not make a mess .	1
Like all Nylabones , this is well designed and done ... and of course comingthru Amazon , you know you will be happy or they will make it right ... This is for medium chewers , not aggressive chewers like my labs ... and theyloved it so much it was very worth while ... .	1
My dog loves the nylabone products . They keep her entertained and last a long time . Going to be a great stocking stuffer .	1
My pup LOVES his dinosaur . It does n't have a head or feet any longer , but the killer of toys has found his match . Going to have to buy a few of these so that they can go into a rotation of hiding under the couch .	1
Last a very long time , my dog still plays with this today and although its bruised he still loves it .	1
Love this toy ! lasts forever and parts cant be chewed off to swallow ! ! great for puppies and large aggressive chewers !	1
My dog is a power chewer and I have one of these for every room . The only time she left it alone was when her baby teeth started coming out , then I just switch her to a smooth Nylabone in the interim .	1
My dog loves this toy , he chewed on it til there was no little bumps left . Warning in case you did n't notice in description , you do n't always get a T-Rex .	1
This toy is made of a very hard material and pieces do n't come off . Knobs help with teething pups . Typical nylabone quality .	1
I have a 1 year old 40lb pitbull/pointer mix that loves to chew . We 've had this toy for about a month now and still is holding up well . We like how the dinosaur has the bumps on it and our dog likes to chew it in his back teeth so it helps with his tartar build up . He stays amused with it while in his crate during the day .	1
I have a full grown Lab and 2 German Shepherds . This dinosaur chew holds up to endless hours of abuse . Nylabone really makes products built for longevity.. I even ran this through the dishwasher to disinfect it after my younger Shepherd bled all over it from teething.. very durable , my dogs only have chewed off little pieces ( nothing larger in diameter than a pencil eraser ) . Highly recommend .	1
I have a dog with very strong jaws . She 's only thirty-five pounds but she goes through most toys like they 're bubblegum . Even as a small puppy , she would destroy anything and everything . By the age of five or six months we had to give up on soft and rope toys altogether , and at a year old , she is limited to only hard chews like Kong , Nylabone , etc . Even then , she destroys most of these with relative ease . She 's gone through chews others have recommended as long-lasting in literally ten minutes . The only toy she has that has lasted more than a month or so is her original red Kong , which she mostly licks instead of chews.I initially bought the dinosaur for my other , less toy-murderous dog , but the power chewer quickly stole it from him . She was in love . She carried it everywhere and chewed on it constantly . I 'm not sure if it 's the shape or the texture she likes , or some combination thereof , but whatever the case , it instantly became her favorite . Even the most durable hard toys normally only last a few weeks with her , but her dino is going on two or three months now . It 's chewed beyond recognition , all the nubs worn down , and it 's very rapidly nearing the end of its life because little bits of plastic are falling off , but it still lasted far longer than most toys do . A few weeks ago I bought her a second one , in a different shape , and she 's equally as enamored with it . All in all , it 's not going to be indestructible if you have a power chewer , but it certainly lasts a heck of a lot longer than most !	1
I chose this rating because our dogs are strong chewers . I ordered 2 and am glad I did . The dogs love them . If you have a hard chewer you might like to get them one of these . They hold up well -- better than the bones did for our dogs . ( so far they have n't chewed any part off ) .	1
All four of my dogs , two small and two medium , love to chew on this dinosaur . You do have to watch out that you do n't step on it in your bare feet ... trust me , it will hurt . And , strong chewers may be able to get chunks off after it 's been chewed on for a while , so keep an eye on it to get a new one if it starts to get thin in places .	1
The dog loves to chew on this all the time ! It is one year later and we still have half of it hanging around for her to chew on .	1
These are a great price , and my dogs ca n't get enough of them ! I give them as gifts occasionally to friends with dogs , and they find their dogs love them as well . I highly recommend . I have two German Shepherd mixes ( one with jaws of steel I think ) and they stand up to the test . Eventually they are worn down to nothing , but that usually takes 2 or 3 months , even with my more active chewer.Warning though , you do n't want to step on these in the middle of the night !	1
My wife 's dog love these bones . We started buying these from amazon for the price as my mutt , who had to re-define what power-chewer means as she destroys black kongs and lacrosse balls , started destroying these as well . They provide at least a month of entertainment for our pups and we buy 2-4 at a time .	1
My miniature poodle - now 8 months old , is a very aggressive chewer . This chew toy is a good one for her . The toy is heavy and has lots of angles and knobs on it and she really chews it hard ... .. She is getting the rest of her adult teeth in . She just chews and chews ... ... and not a mark on the toy . I 'm happy with my purchase .	1
My two terrier mixes ( 20 lbs . and 32 lbs . ) love to chew , and their paws-down favorites over the past five years have been Nylabone Dental Dinosaurs . We go through 2-3 sets per year and have have no problems , with the exception of an occasion bit of gum bleeding ( very slight ) when someone gets a bit carried away . Well , that , and having to confiscate the toys when we 're trying to sleep , since their chewing enjoyment is a bit too noisy for nighttime ! After months of use , I take the worn down toys away and replace them , and I regularly check to make sure there are no sharp edges or larger parts that look as if they could break off and be ingested.If you have a dog that loves chewing , I 've say to give them a try , at first with supervision . If your dogs are like mine , these toys will offer many hours of entertainment and cleaner teeth to boot .	1
My dogs chew everything in sight , so one of my friends recommended & # 34 ; nylabones & # 34 ; . I ordered 2 from here . They love them , but they do drive me crazy fighting over them ! The dogs ca n't get enough of them . This one is kind of pointy and one of my dogs did cut her lip from chewing so hard , but they still love it !	1
This is my dog 's favorite nylabone , and I have purchased several of these ( and many other nylabone products ) . She is a husky and a very strong chewer , and nylabone is the only thing that she ca n't chew up in 5 minutes ! These are great for heavy chewers ! ( The material might be too hard for dogs that do n't chew heavily- try the puppy ones or the edible nylabones instead )	1
I should have ordered more . all 5 dogs of varying size love to chew on it for hours . so far , no choking issues	1
My puppy loves he carries it from room to room . It 's very durable it feels good on a teething puppies gums .	1
Puppy loves it and that 's great ! I love Nylabone products and this one does not disappoint . My pup really enjoyed this immediately and it sure beats chewing other things .	1
this is a pretty tough nylon ! My Staffordshire Terrier chews on this quite frequently . I am happy with anything that lasts over a week . She has had this since Christmas !	1
She loves this dinosaur ... seriously loves it . She has many shapes of the Nylabone products -- this guy however is by far her favorite . The head , feet , tail -- all chewed off , only the center body is left.I like these because they are designed to massage gums , clean plaque from teeth and as a doggie bonus , they are flavored . I do recommend the dinosaur in particular on her behalf -- she ca n't type but from the rate of chew , this is a good one .	1
bought two for my two golden retriever pups , they both love them , sometimes share other times fighting over them . great for their teeth and teething	1
Durable . No mess . Safe for my pet . During the worst of the teething phase this product helped with chewing . This product along with other teething soothers worked for our dog .	1
Went over well with the pup . It took a few months for her to get older and chew on these but they hold up well .	1
Dog and Cat both love it.. I believe it is the bums on the product they like to feel on gums . I have a pit and she has yet to chew through it so it is as described , durable . Of course it arrived on time and as described .	1
My lab puppy loves this chew toy ! He has managed to flatten the nubs on the toy but it has not broken off into pieces . Highly recommended for a lab puppy or an aggressive chewer . I love the Nylabone chew toys because they are the longest lasting things we could find for our pup who manages to destroy and shred all of his toys . Great product !	1
I got this for my beagle pup as she can not stop chewing . I 've purchased nearly every chew toy Amazon sells and finally got this . It was too hard for my 11 week old puppy . She check it out , mouthed it and never touched it again . Maybe when she gets larger ... .Meanwhile , my 8 year-old son loves dinosaurs and wanted it . So , now it 's his . He knows he might be able to give it up one day , but I do n't think I will be able to get it back .	1
This is a great chew toy , it lasts a long time , it massages the dogs gums , helps keep teeth and gums healthy .	1
Works great and it is in my puppy 's crate most of the time . It is heavy which I suppose means it might last awhile . He chews it and as long as he is chewing this and not my furniture I am happy .	1
Toys do n't last very long in my house . Between lab puppies , weenie dogs , fosters , and clients , I have tons of chew-monsters to help me redecorate , utilize toys , and frost the downstairs so I do n't usually buy anything that ca n't stand up . They are still here and they are still mostly intact . I would buy these again once the other nylabones are gone .	1
I am always pleased to use Amazon to order various items . We ordered 3 Dental Dinosaurs and as always , we were pleased with the promptness and the quickness in which we received our order from the supplier . Thank you .	1
I could n't tell how big this item looked online but it is actually kind of bigger than I thought for a small dog ( 15 pounds ) . The dog still likes chewing on it though .	1
My heeler loves this over the regular large bone shape nylabone . This is a very hard toy , so maybe she feels more destructive . Think it gives her more area to chew on at one time .	1
I thought it was going to be a little bigger , but my dog that is a heavy chewer likes it ! If she likes it , then I like it !	1
My dog can tear stuff up in a second flat but this toy was great and the pieces that they can pick off are so small they will just ass through the stool no problem . Just had to cut back the sharp edges with a scissor every once in awhile so he did n't damage his gums .	1
Great product for those puppies or adult dogs who can chew through anything . This will keep them busy for sure . Once your pet gets this started , chances are it will be a favorite chew until the nubs wear down . I have two power-chewing Puggles . Unlike everything else I 've tried , this is NOT a 5-minute toy . They seek these things out and it satisfies the need for a good long gnawing session .	1
This lasted my crazy border two weeks before the nearly chewed the animal 's head off . He liked it a lot , but definitely supervise and be aware that it wont last him forever .	1
Nylabones are strong . They do n't come apart and my dogs play with them for hours . It is a toy they do n't get tired of . They go to their toy box and take them out to play . They have lots of Nylabones and I will keep ordering more.The dinosaur is a favorite because my grandchildren collect dinosaurs	1
I 've always had good luck with Nylabone products . My dogs absolutely LOVE this one , though . I think breaking away from the bone shape that they are used to really stirred their interest . Ca n't beat the price you get online , either . I 'm sure this would be twice as much at a pet store .	1
Our puppy likes to chew on his dinosaur . He has n't made much of a dent in it but he does like to chew on it .	1
My Bo just loves this . I think because of all the ridges on it is why he enjoys it . When he loses it he goes wondering around looking for it	1
I bought two of these for my pups and received the T-rex and stegosaurus . They were a bit smaller than what I was expecting , but they will work for my two 35-40 lb dogs .	1
Great for my determined chewer . He spends quite a bot of time chewing on it . It is made of a very hard plastic material .	1
This toy is hard and heavy and my dog loves it . He has a habit of obliterating all toys in his path . We got the triceratops and he 's barely made a dent on the head or tail . It 's been a huge help to get through teething .	1
My pit mix loves this , and it 's one of the few chew toys that has lasted over a month . It seems to keep her teeth clean , and because it 's pretty lightweight , she can flip it in the air and run after it to entertain herself . Also the pieces come off in really small shavings , not shards or chunks . Highly recommend !	1
I have hounds that chew - four of them . This dinosaur keeps them out of trouble and happy . I will be buying lots more !	1
he is a chewer & this toy is almost as loved as one of his bones , , , and far prettier to look at ,	1
These are great for those heavy chewers ... .. They last long and both of my dogs love them ! I will buy them again .	1
A little smaller than I expected it to be but very sturdy . Take care not to step on it , it 's sharp ! Ouch !	1
I did not actually see this product as it was delivered to Best Friends Animal Society but it was on their wish list so I hope they are satisfied with it	1
I just got a pitbull mix from a shelter , she is a very persistent and strong chewer . She loved this toy , and so far it has held up really well .	1
We love nylabones around our home . Our two goldens must have the durable nylabone as they quickly destroy a flexible one . I thought that this Dinosaur Nylabone was the bigger size since it said Wolf but it was pretty small at 4 inches . I had to give it to my friend 's cocker spaniel . It was just too small for a golden retriever .	1
My dogs LOVE Nylabone products , and they are both aggresstive chewers . This dinosaur is durable , and neither of my dogs have been able to destroy it so far . The only complaint I have is that the tail and the head are very small and pointed ( the Stegasaurus is the one that came ) which my dogs might be able to break off if they chew hard enough . Overall , I think it 's a great toy , and as long as my dogs are happy so am I !	1
My GR puppy destroys all soft toys so I get her the durable plastic/rubber toys . She randomly chews on this dinasour and it has held up well for the past 6 mths she has had it . She is now 10 mths old . A good , durable chew toy .	1
The pup loves this toy . His iron jaw is kept busy for large blocks of time and it 's safe for him to digest .	1
I have 3 different dinosaurs for the Rottie puppy that CHEWS . Other than Elk Antlers these are the only durable chews she will touch and not destroy within minutes .	1
These are really hard plastic , and pretty much indestructible ( from what I 've seen thus far ) . That said , not my dog 's favorite toy , which is why it lost a star . If I could get him to chew on this as much as he tries to chew on my armchair , I 'd add a sixth star .	1
I 'm debating over buying more of these or just see if eventually she 'll try something else . She chewed the head off and tail .	1
This was a good bone for our large breed puppy . She seemed to prefer it over other bones and toys . Maybe because of the shape or the smaller edges and ends . The head was the first to go but the rest is still mostly intact after 3 months of puppy chewing . Nylabone make good , durable bones for aggressive chewers .	1
My dogs have a variety of Nylabones and one from Hartz as well and they all get chewed on depending on what my boys are in the mood for . They regularly compete to be the one to get dinosaur , so I would rank that as this one being a favorite . Both my dogs are heavy chewers , but the nylabones seem to last a good long while and they never get tired of them . One other thing , the dinosaur ( with all the little nubs ) is probably the most horrible thing to step on when making a trip to the bathroom in the middle of the night !	1
my two puppies fight over this toy and i have thought about getting more.. but have yet too lol its a mint flavor i think and great for medium and smaller dogs definitely not for a bigger dog over 50.lbs or more ... both of mine are about 35.lbs and its the perfect size for them = )	1
I could n't resist this toy for my dog - mostly because it 's so cute but also because of the price . I also kinda like the & # 34 ; surprise & # 34 ; of not knowing what you 'll get . We received a brontosaurus . My puppy loves it , carries it everywhere , and it keeps her from chewing the furniture . I would definitely purchase again and certainly recommend it for any chewy-puppy parents ! Ca n't go wrong with nylabone .	1
I bought this for my dogs to clean their teeth and so far it has held up just fine ! They do n't chew on it alllll the time but it has lasted us a long time and looks like it will last a good bit longer ! The only thing that surprised me was how small it was but that 's not a problem since they try and throw it around a lot . Great product though !	1
Good choice good toy well made my three love it so they each have to have one . It 's pretty good for puppies as well .	1
Love nylabone no rawhide and our pug loves this dino . Will last him probably years . Recommend nylabone made in USA .	1
This is a good chew toy for our puppy , has held up for a while . My only complaint is it gets shredded spikes as the puppy chews it up and then picks up carpet fibers that stick to it .	1
Was concerned at first thought it might be to rough for my dogs teeth she seems to like it and it seems to clean her teeth	1
Just as pictured and described . A dyno-nylabone dog chew toy . Has the little nodules to supposibly stimulate gums . Basically it is what they say it is and I have no complaints . I feel it is a great value and was cheaper than our local pet store .	1
My pooch loves to chew his dinosaur . The bumps on the outside seem to help clean his teeth and the shape keeps him interested . Will buy again when he destroys this one .	1
This is great and I will totally be reordering this a bunch for my dog . Definitely a favorite and a real time consumer !	1
I admit , the reason I bought this toy was because it was so cute . Fortunately , my dog seems to like it as much as I do . She loves anything nylabone , and this was no exception . When I pulled it out of the package , she grabbed it and ran off with it . It 's been one of her favorite toys since . The durability of nylabone toys continues to surprise me , even in the face of a super destructive chewer .	1
He loves biting on this toy , especially since our Great Pyrenees is teething . I wish I had gotten one that was a little larger .	1
Got this for my Lab puppy and he loved it . Really helpful for losing those sharp puppy teeth : ) I keep a few on hand for chewing , but he goes through them quicker now that he has his adult teeth .	1
My dogs love to chew on these and while they are not as durable as some , they do last quite a while . The dogs seem to like this shape the best of all the ones I have tried . They are a good price for as long as they last . When the dogs do get off pieces they are not big or pointy ( think bare feet ) to walk on . Also when they swallow pieces they have never yet made anyone ill .	1
We have a chihuahua terrier mix , and she loves this ! More so than the other nylabones . It 's thicker and has more angles since she always seems to chew the ends .	1
Love this chew toy because my dog loves them . It helps keep her molars clean . Just do n't step on it in your bare feet because the dimples on it get very sharp after it been chewed on .	1
My 2 dogs ( American Bulldog and Boxer ) have one of these and have yet to destroy it even after 2 years . I purchased one for my sister as a gift for her new puppy and she immediately started chewing on it . She loves it ! Very high quality . I only purchase Nylabone products due to their durability and Amazon is sooooo much cheaper than the pet stores !	1
I normally buy the Large , super durable Nylabones for my 35lb shepherd mix . However these were on sale so I decided to give one a try . Both of my dogs LOVED this bone as soon as it arrived . However , it is much smaller and softer than the bones I normally buy , and it did not take long at all before it had been chewed into something to small for my dog to safely continue chewing on . If you have smaller dogs who do n't have a shepherd 's powerful jaw , then this bone is for you .	1
I like how this toy looks . Not sure my dog cares . She does like to chew it though . Its super durable and she has barely been able to make a dent in the toy . She is very powerful in chewing too so this toy really stands up to her destructive nature . Its a good toy and was reasonably priced .	1
I bought one of these to start and both my dogs loved it , so I bought another one so they did n't have to try and share one . I got lucky and actually ended up with two different styles of dinosaur . I love nylabone products and will probably put another dino in my amazon cart soon !	1
My tiny little dog loves this toy so much , he drags it all around the house and to bed with him !	1
Took the toy out to show my dogs . My older dog immediately wanted to chew on it which is great because she is not usuallyinterested in new toys . Should be good on their gums . Looks big online so check out the measurements so you are notdisappointed .	1
My bullies love Nylabones , they are the one thing that they do not destroy ! I got them these & the big smooth bone 2 pack for Christmas . Those were a big hit , these they do n't seem to like . I do not know if it 's the flavor or texture . . . They have the big smooth heavy bone looking Nylabones which they like okay , they have the BIG nubby ones which they love , so I thought they would like these but they looked at them , chewed on them a little & left them for the big smooth flavored ones in the 2 pack . Those they chew on daily along with the big nubby ones . Maybe it 's the flavor . They have Nylabones that are 3 years old !	1
I bought these for 2 of my neighbors dogs and they love them ! The dogs are very active and really enjoying them ! I will be buying more !	1
hours of fun for the pup - some dogs seem to play with these and tires of them - she chews on them for weeks .	1
I loved the idea of the dinosaur chew toy for my dog and could n't resist buying him one . I do wish they would give you a choice in the dinosaur type , but random selection is n't terrible . The 3 types shown online are all pretty cute . We received the brontosaurus . My dog weighs 30 pounds and a big chewer . He loves his other Nylabone bone chews , but has not really gotten into his dino chew . I think something about the bumps on the exterior put him off it . He likes to move it around the room and carry it places but has not chewed on it much at all . Sometimes I find him just licking it . We 've had it almost two weeks . Maybe once the new has worn off he will chew on it more . He does seem to like it and will carry it places which is pretty funny . Overall I am happy with the purchase .	1
My dogs ( 2 Dachshunds and 1 Labrador Retriever ) absolutely LOVE these bones ! I 'm not sure what it is , but this is their go-to Nylabone . I used to purchase them at pet stores , but Amazon has been the cheapest on them for a while now ( yes , my dogs chew so many of these bones that I should really buy stock in them ! ) , so I always come here now when my pups need some more dinos .	1
I have 2 puppies and they fought over this so much I had to buy another . They chew on this more than anything I have ever seen them do before . Do n't understand why , but this is a BIG hit ! !	1
I bought this as a gift for a family member 's doggy . Doggy is very happy with it and plays with it ( or should I say chews it ) frequently .	1
This is my third nylabone purchase for a 55lb lab . She loves them ! She can go to town and chew on them for about 9 months before the wear is so bad that large flakes start to come off . Well worth it for a dog who normally destroys a toy in 3 minutes .	1
My dogs love these Dino nylabones . They are great for hard chewers . I have 5 dogs ranging from 150 to 10 pounds and they all can chew on these . I highly recommend .	1
These chews are great . My dachshund-mix 3-month-old puppies were not too interested in the classic nylabone so I got these , and they just LOOOVE them . It 's their # 1 chew-toy . They can sit in their beds and chew on it forever . I also recommend the Nylabone fish . For some reason the funky shapes and textures are just much more enticing than the regular bone shape . One more note : to get them really hooked on Nylabones I 've found that I have to hold the toy for them to chew on at first ( so they build really positive associations with it : bone='mom ' ) , at the beginning of a chewing session , and then they 're hooked . Do n't necessarily expect your dog to just chew it without any of your involvement . The more you 're involved , the more he 'll enjoy it !	1
I did n't really think that this toy would become a favorite - it did n't have stuffing or eyeballs for my dogs to rip out . However , for some reason , unknown to me , my dogs have taken to it and it is their new favorite toy . One of my three labs is always carrying it around or chewing it . It certainly does n't look like a dinosaur anymore . But hey , they love it all the same .	1
At least 1 out of 2 dogs enjoys it periodically . It definitely does n't get chewed down . The material is very , very hard and I had my doubts about it and the dogs teeth , . However both walmart and petsmart carry tons of nylabone stuff so I figured iT HAd to be alright or there would have been recalls . Me I do n't like it , but the dog does and since she does n't chew on it obsessively , unlike other things I 'm not too worried about her teeth .	1
looks gnarly but our dog loves to chew it . after 4 months you ca n't tell it was a dino . our dog loves to chew it and we hope its good for the teeth as it claims . we also have theNylabone Galileo Bone Dog Chew Toy , Wolfwhich is more robust .	1
The dog loves it and carries it around . It stands up to a lot of bitting with no damage.Great toy	1
My pitbull LOVES to chew and pretty much destroys anything she gets her mouth on . This has held up rather well and she seems to enjoy all of the little nubs .	1
I have a medium sized dog ( king charles / bichon mix ) and he is a big time chewer . He 's been working on this for over 6 months now and he 's done some damage to the tail but still has not lost interest in it . The only & # 34 ; con & # 34 ; I can think of for this toy is that it does have a large collection of sharp points which I suppose is great for teeth cleaning but a pain in *ss when you step on it running to the bathroom in the dark at 3am . : )	1
I should have purchased more , I have a chihuahua , an afen pinscher and a german shepherd , they ALL LOVE this toy . I am going to purchase another one ! !	1
My puppy LOVES this product . It is extremely durable against her heavy chewing , too . I 'm not sure what attracts her to this , but she chooses it over several others toys in her toy box regularly !	1
I 've had this product for about a month and it 's been one of my dogs favorite chew toys . I recently took her in for a vet check up and they did n't have anything to say about her teeth being in bad condition or any injuries but she 's had it pretty chewed up after a month . For the price though , it 's kept her very entertained , I 'll probably have to order another one soon . Some of the other reviews worry me a little bit but she does n't appear to have had any issues with it so far and I feel it should be fine if i replace it soon since she 's chewed it up pretty good so far . I think she likes it more than her other chew toys because of the texture and shape.. It 's not plain like her regular nylabone so it catches her interest more . Although she has appeared to have gotten the head off so that may be a concern , hopefully it wo n't be a problem but I 'm not an expert , just worth noting that the first thing that might happen is the head being chewed off .	1
My dog loves the antler bones but they are expensive . This holds her over in between and lasts for a long time . Great to alternate chewing items to mix things up .	1
I have purchased about 5 of these over the course of a year and almost all of them still have something left.My dog chews quite a bit and Nylabone is my brand of choice . These little dinosaurs seem to last forever .	1
My dog loves nylabones . I believe he kinda looks like TREX so i went to buy this . Unfortunately they do tell you it varies on which dyno you recieve . I didnt get the TREX.. I got a Stegosaurus . He loves it still . The shape really well designed for chewing . I would absolutely buy this again	1
We have two year old pit mixes and a 5 month old APBT , who are medium to aggressive in chew style . A lot of times the nylabones get overlooked or hidden deep under the couch , but this one was a cherished toy . Our male would carry this around , showing it off to everyone . All three really enjoyed the texture , and it lasted a good month before it was sent to chew toy afterlife .	1
This toy will take a beating and go on for a long time . Dog is happy . I am very happy .	1
Just like the Nylabone Dura Chew Wishbone Chew Toy , my dog can chew on this toy for hours and is unable to destroy it , plus it keeps her interest .	1
My dog loves the Nylabone Dental Dinosaur ! Our vet recommends them for keeping the molars clean and the work . Highly recommend this product .	1
This is my 8 mth old english bulldogs favorite toy . He chews on it for hours at a time and it has n't lost it 's ridges or anything . I would recommend .	1
My puppy usually does n't like & # 34 ; bumply & # 34 ; toys but he adores this one . I have the Stegosaurus one . The puppy carries this toy everywhere with him . It has the Fresh Taste which my puppy loves the best . Go figure !	1
This is the only toy my dog hasnt destroyed within a few hours ( except a kong ball ) . Im not sure if she gets bored with it or if its just that durable ? Its a cute little toy just dont leave the son of a gun where you can step on it ! It hurts worse than a lego !	1
You can never go wrong with a Nylabone chew toy . Durable , attractive to dogs , do n't leave a mess as they pass right through there system . Definitely worth the money .	1
This is a great product for heavy chewers . My dogs love these and they keep their teeth clean . They last a long time , but you 'll want to be sure to discard them when they are so warn that your dog can tear little pieces off .	1
Nylabones are great . Not expensive and they last forever . Our dog loves to chew , but these hold up . Highly recommend .	1
My puppy loves this toy ! She has chewed the tail almost down to nothing ! So far safe and nothing has come off or loose .	1
My puppy LOVES this chew toy ! He got the brontosaurus - I 'm hoping to get the other varieties for him , too.He absolutely goes nuts playing with this thing and chewing on it , which makes me a happy dog-momma !	1
We love the nylabone durable dental dinosaur chew toy ! Our very active , heavy chewing weim will often go to his toy bin and pull it out to chew on it . 4 stars instead of 5 because I wish we could select the dino variety we wanted instead of just seeing what comes in the mail .	1
dogs enjoyed it . It is a chew toy a little bigger than my hand . Worth the $ 3 i paid for it .	1
Reflections of Mamie-A Story of SurvivalThis is definitely one chew toy that has held up well . No signs of destruction and great for the teeth . Again , beware some puppies that chew a lot need to be watched for signs of breakage on this nylabone.Ask your Vet to be sure . Our puppy loves this one and has had it for three weeks with no signs of wear ! ! She loves it after it has been in the freezer .	1
Had NO idea that my dachshunds would LOVE this chew toy - but they do ! We have the Nylabone & # 34 ; stick & # 34 ; too and they love them both although they like this dinosaur better - I think it is because it has smaller areas for them to gnaw on . I will be getting another one of these when they use up the first one .	1
This chew toy is awesome . Our beagle puppy loves it and chews for along time . It doesnt break up . Absolutely as described and I would suggest this chew to anyone with a puppy / big dog also .	1
all dogs in home love it.tough enough for the biggest dog in the house ( over 100 pounds ) do n't know why you need to put so many words in this , but I do n't have anything else to say .	1
My dogs really enjoyed this Christmas present . I think this will last for a very long time and will help their teeth & gums .	1
In true Nylabone fashion , this toy is very durable . It was a bit smaller than I expected it to be , but my dog loves it . Has quickly become one of his favorites .	1
My teething puppy loves this toy . The nubs that protrude all over the toy are wonderful on his gums . It it smaller than I thought and my large breed puppy has outgrown it before his teething phase is over . I still let him chew on it , but only when he is supervised .	1
I have two dogs , one is a heavy chewer . Both dogs love this toy and will take turns stealing it from each other . It has held up well , even when my heavy chewer gets ahold of it . I was n't sure it would hold up well because it is a bit thin and has pieces that stick out , like the foot and head , but it has held up surprisingly well .	1
I have a six month pup that is about 35 pounds and chews EVERYTHING ! Totally demolishes whatever she can get her hands on ! I 'm hoping this helps satisfy her chewing needs without being destroyed . It looks great and is exactly what I was wanting so fingers are crossed ! : - )	1
Both times i purchased this product for my dogs i can give this item an A+ . I love American made items so this is a double bonus !	1
This chew toy is loved by the dog , not by me . It lasts a long time and holds the dogs interest BUT after chewing a bit , it has sharp edges and when the dog drops it at your feet- it 's HARD and SHARP . No thanks . I 'm picking something a little softer next time .	1
I bought this for my Mom 's Boston Terrier who is notorious for tearing up most of his toys . This proved to be very durable and a favorite for him . A week went by , and he had n't destroy it yet . Amazing . Then he buried it in my Mom 's backyard . It 's gone now . But it was good while it lasted .	1
This was an awesome add on - i 'm so glad i bought two . They are both still around and being chewed on daily by my two dogs after 3 months ! Perfect . What more could you ask for . It does the job , and helps clean the teeth , too ! ? double AWESOME & # 62 ;	1
Absolutely love this chew toy . Keeps my dog busy for hours and she walks around the house with it . Purchased 2 backups in the event we ca n't find one.Priceless !	1
I bought the Nylabone dinosaur chew toy for my 80lb . Greyhound and instead my 20lb Bichon has taken charge of it . He chews on it several times a day . The Greyhound does n't stand a chance getting to it !	1
It all depends on whether your dog likes it or not . My friend 's dog chews up toys within a day or two of getting them . He has this one still after several months . The head is gone , but the rest is intact . My boyfriend 's dog , however , only picks it up when she knows I 'm waiting for her to play with it . My only complaint is that when your dog is carrying it around , if he scrapes up against you with the little nubs can be pretty sharp .	1
We have two lab mixes . The youngest is still very much in puppy stage and boy does he love to chew ! We had given him rawhides to keep his focus on something appropriate to chew , but he was going through too many rawhides . I saw nylabones in petsmart in the heavy chewers section . The first plain bone went over well . So I ordered more on Amazon . I 'm so glad I did ! These were the best solution to keep our chewer occupied ! He loves all the different shapes and flavor toys that they have ! Thank goodness for nylabones !	1
Got this for my golden who chew everything and he has not been able to destroy this as yet ! Plus it is good for his teeth and massages his gums .	1
This is the best dino out ! I wish I could have picked which one I got but it did n't really matter . my pup loves it and I will probably be getting a new one soon to give the 1st one a break .	1
We 've bought all sorts of Nylabone chew toys from rings to bones to the tree stick to these dinosaurs . This T-Rex is by far my girl 's favorite . It 's easy to hold and chew . My girl is a chihuahua/terrier mix . She has chewed down to the t-rex arms on both of her bones . I buy back-ups because only 1 place in town sells them . If they sell out then I 'll be buying them here on Amazon .	1
I got this for my Labrabull , who is an aggressive 3 month old . I got the stagisaurus in the mail ( wish I got the TRex : / ) . My dog loves it , pulls it out of his toy bin and just lays and bites non-stop . However , this is n't super durable . The first day he had it , within maybe an hour it had visible signs of being chewed on , so be careful if your dog is an aggressive chewer .	1
Dogs seem to like it but I 'm concerned about how easily it seems to be breaking down around the head area .	1
I bought one of these initially just to see if my dogs would like it . They ALL love it and fight over it , so I ended up getting more ( not that that stopped my one dog from hoarding all of them ) . Just be warned that you may not get the dinosaur pictured on Amazon . I got two stegosauruses and one t-rex .	1
I constantly am on the search for durable chews and these are what I 've been needing ! They ar n't obnoxiously big and my huskies love them ! Its day 4 and still are in tact . HUGE kudos to Nylabone for this product . Definitely recommend !	1
I have two of these things ( T-Rex and stegosaurus ) and my two mini-dachshunds LOVE them . They 're very durable with no bits breaking off like some other bones , and they 're covered with tiny little nubby bumps that work to scrape and clean dogs ' teeth while they chew on them.These are very good chew toys , and I recommend them !	1
We got this for our pitbull she loves it we are going to order it again she chewed through it pretty quick being her size she loved her dinosaur so we have to get it for her	1
Great for strong chewers . My dog has been working on this for a few weeks and it shows no signs of failing . It 's not as interesting to him as other toys , but he picks it up occasionally and it keeps him entertained for good stretches .	1
The dinosaur shape provides some extra texture and angles for chewing but the nylabone material has been helping it last longer than I expected .	1
I choose this rating because I bought for a gift for my cousins pooches . They love nylabone ( where as my dogs won'ttouch them ! ) . I like the cute shapes and the price . Recommend for all nylabone lovers !	1
In fact , the middle & # 34 ; torso & # 34 ; section is still floating around my house all these months later . My dogs have had several bone shaped toys made of the same material that are nearly fully still in tact ... .but for whatever reason , they loved this one . I 'm going to buy another one right now .	1
My puppy is a yellow lab and he loooves his `` dino '' toy . He has had it since he was 2 months , is 6 months now , and chewed off the head , tail , and legs , and still is thrilled with it ! ! It 's his # 2 fav . toy ! I would recommend it for anyone whith a large breed puppy/teenage dog .	1
This is possibly one of the best toys we got for our dog . He 's a 55 pound pit bull mutt and he is constantly chewing on the toys we get him . Even the toys that claim they are indestructible inevitably get destroyed by him . Not this one . We have had it the longest out of any toy we have given him , and the best part about it is that it also helps clean his teeth because of the little bumps all over it . If you have a dog who is constantly destroying any toys you give him or her , get this and you wo n't be disappointed . While it 's worth noting that no toy is ever completely indestructible , this one has withstood the test of time and is still going on , even though he has chewed a bit off of it .	1
A friend of mine has a Border Collie who is a ruthless and devout chewer , who absolutely adores this toy . But , my Aussie is more of a fetcher than a chewer so although he 'll have his moments with it , it 's not his go to chew toy . Which is the only reason it lacks full stars for myself . But , despite my dogs personal preferences , as a product this is a great chew toy . If your dog has a tendency to chew through anything and everything for hours on end , I would absolutely recommend this to you .	1
Our Aussie , Iggy , is an extreme chewer , and this $ 5 bone is worth it . It 's smaller than I had expected but , even after a month Iggy has only destroyed the head . She will happily chew on this ( when we redirect her ) . The first couple times she used it her spit was pink so I think her gums might have bled a little , but that stopped . We will be purchasing more Nylabones as they are so affordable , long lasting , CLEAN , ( unlike rope toys that can be distributed throughout your house fiber by color fiber ) and enjoyable chew toys found.Caution : stepping on this toy in the dark can bring a full grown person to their knees . Use care when left out ( or always wear slippers )	1
Very very durable item . My dog loves this and ca n't tear it up . She will just chew and chew on it .	1
I purchased this product a year ago and it was the long-neck dino and my black lab adored it . This go around with my new 10wk chocolate lab , I got the T-rex and he loves it ! Great quality .	1
I wondered how my dog would like this , he does n't like the teeth cleaning chews but he loves it , I do n't know how long it will hold up but when needed I 'll buy again	1
Little Brown Pup really likes chewing on this , and she seems to know it 's not for burying . Huzzah for chew toys that stay in the house !	1
We got the stegosaurus and it is great . Cool design and good for our dog that is a strong chewer .	1
My dog loves these . They are by far her favorite chew toys and among her cheapest . Go figure .	1
This turned out to be a big hit with my dog Mario . He loves it.I love it too because it keeps him busy and out of my hair for a while .	1
Great chewing toy , keeps my dog occupied for a while but I have to rotate it with another nylabone toy so she does not get bored .	1
This Nylabone is durable and keeps our pup busy . She is teething and seems to really enjoy it . It is not large , but well sized for a medium puppy .	1
My dog hated this toy when she was a teething puppy . It is made of hard plastic material and she was unable to sink her teeth into the toy . But now that she is a year old and an extreme chewer , this toy has been amazing . She is still on her first one and has only chewed about a 1/4 of it away . For the price this is a must have toy !	1
My dalmatian just loves her dino . it was her fav nylabone that she got for christmas . the only thing i do n't like is that the ends are easy for her to chew up and become sharp but other than that it is holding up well . she is a power chewer and we have n't had any problems with it breaking apart ( note-she is only allowed to use most of her toys under supervision . just incase ) . she also has a large slection of treats and a couple of kongs so she does n't chew on just one toy all day .	1
I was afraid this toy would tear my dogs gums and mouth since it was so prickly and hard but it did not ! He loves it but he does n't chew on it a long time at once . Maybe it is uncomfortable - but so far it has held up and he is still interested in it .	1
Eli is now 10 months old , a labrador retriever that proves time and time again he needs toys that he can chew , but wo n't fall apart . He can not have the stuffed animal toys ( no , those he 'll tear apart in SECONDS , never mind minutes ) . Aside from the Kong and the antler , this is the only toy he can chew on that wo n't fall apart . Even animal bones will split in minutes.Since he was a couple of months old , he has loved this Dinosaur Chew Toy . When he was teething , I 'd put it in the freezer ( sometimes put peanut butter on it to keep his interest ) . It was not only great for teething , but also massaged his gums . Now that he 's out of teething phase , he still loves to chew on it.For the money , this is worth it . It 's saved the furniture and the house from being chewed on , as he focused on this toy instead . Highly recommend , especially for the price . For any strong-chewing pup or dog in particular , this toy wo n't shatter , split or break apart .	1
This chew toy is such a hit , I have to buy a new one every 6 months . I give it as a present every chance I get !	1
This is one of the few chewy bones that my dog did not destroy in a day . She had it for months , slowly working on it until the head and tail were gone and only the body remained . She would have continued chewing because she loved it , but it disappeared somewhere . A lot of chew toys claim to be durable , but I have found this one to live up to that claim the most .	1
My grand dog is a tough chewer who destroys toys and is only given nylabones , etc . These dinosaur chews are his favorite and regularly gets them from his favorite Grandma . Amazon had the best price ... ... .	1
Cute little t-rex at a good price . The dogs love it , chewing on it and tossing it around . Lasts as long as other Nylabone products , a good buy for the money .	1
My dog chews everything to bits - except this dinosaur nylabone . He loves it . I wish I had gotten two of them .	1
my terrier mix chews on this all day long and he 's only gone through the head and tail ! very much recommended ! I actually bought 3 more ...	1
My dog is a chewer- he destroys anything he is given the chance to . He chews on this thing for hours every night . Just lays on the floor and chews it . And it is still intact . It 's amazing . He will be able to continue chewing it for a looooong time ! Side note : it REALLY hurts when you do n't notice he has left it in the middle of a walking path and you step on it .	1
Nylabones are the best . Our dogs love them . Bought this smaller one for our frenchie and she loves it . Awesome	1
... on behalf of my dogs here , as I have not personally tested them . The K9 family members seem to be happy , though !	1
This is not as big as I first thought however my chewing pup loves it and so I had to buy a second one after 3 months because the first one only had a small part left but he still carried it around ! !	1
My pitbull loves to chew more than anything else . Since he 's had this dinosaur ( several months now ) , he 's only just now started to destroy the head of the T-Rex . He chews on it whenever he realizes that it is around , so that 's some good durability . I definitely recommend it for all the chewers out there !	1
The `` stick '' Nylabone was their favorite until we got the T. Rex . I told my wife she was nuts for getting it but they love it . Guess we 'll have to try the other dino one also . It 's funny how they 'll go after one spot . On this one it 's the tail . With the regular shaped bones they 'll make one end look like it went through a wood chipper and the other end looks like you just opened it .	1
This dog chew is practically indestructible and my Beagle can destroy just about everything . It provides good chewing without worry that it will damage my dogs teeth .	1
My boys love these dinosaurs chew toys . I bought more than one and they have lasted longer than other teething toys . If your dog destroys toys , try these . I 'm glad I did .	1
Even for dogs that are 'hard chewers ' , this toy is wonderful ! Yes , they can , , and will , eventually wear down parts of the toy { esp the head and tail } from gnawing on it , but it does n't break off into small pieces as some toys can . I 've used this for big and small dogs , and they all love it equally ! I think the 'bumps ' on the surface of the toy help stimulate the teeth/gums , and it must feel good when they chew on it . Great toy !	1
My small dogs love all the nylabone chews . They have a lot of them and they constantly are chewing on one . This is a good one for my small dogs .	1
My dog Cotton is an aggressive chewer she could chew her way through anything within seconds & then she 's looking for something else to chew . She 's a 3yr old Coton de Tulear a rare breed which are in the bichon family My dog is very hyper & has nervous energy she does n't know what to do with , I thought getting her a chew toy would keep her busy for a while , but they did n't even last for a day . I went on line and read reviews from other 's reviews on different chew toys , when I read the reviews for this dinosaur chew and read their had the same issues my dog had and their dogs were a lot bigger & weighed more then my dog is small & weighs 15 lbs . I thought this chew would be a perfect chew toy & it would last for a longer period it has lasted & she is still chewing on it after 4 months . This is going to be a second dinosaur chew I am buying for her as a backup . She loves this toy and I would recommend this for those pet owners who have dogs who are heavy aggressive chewers this will last a long time . I love it and I save money & no longer need to buy any other chew toy but this dinosaur chew.Suzan Mesquite NV	1
My 50+ pound pitbull/lab mix LOVES this toy . We 've had it for a month and it 's nowhere close to being destroyed . I am really concerned after reading the reviews though , so I will definitely only let him play with this toy under supervision from now on . My boy is still a puppy though and he 's a vigorous chewer so I 'm always amazed when something actually lasts more than an hour in our home .	1
My pug is a heavy duty chewer who goes through any Nylabone in a few weeks . We tried this Dino for a different shape , and it has been very popular . He and his foster sister chug fight over it , so cute ! Beware of stepping on it in your bare feet though- those bumps hurt !	1
Solid toy . Dogs do not really care about it . Maybe when they are older I can reinterduce the toy again .	1
With a new puppy in the house , plus our 8 yo adult dog it is important that we keep plenty of toys around to redirect their attention . This nylabone is a cute toy that serves exactly that purpose . Our 8 yo dog leaves tooth prints in the toy but would not be able to destroy it if she tried .	1
My Catahoula tore it out of my hand the moment she saw it and ran off with it . Five hours later , she was still chewing on it . I only wish she 'd gotten the brontosaurus instead of the stegosaurus as she tends to chew off sharp edges first . Still , if it keeps her from chewing the furniture ( which it does ) , I do n't care what it looks like . Seems to be a winner .	1
Bought this on amazon for a great price , tough and long lasting . My little dog loves it and is a heavy chewer- he 's not been able to destroy this thing in a short period of time and it 's one of his favorite go-to chew toys . Very happy and will probably buy another of this item !	1
This toy is the perfect size for my medium as well as large lab . The lab destroys all bones but this one holds up well and it is the perfect size for my aussie mix as well .	1
My dog loves this little dinosaur ! ! I 'm going to buy more in different shapes too : ) I def recommend this ! He 's a tough chewer and this lasted a long time .	1
My dogs loved this , but it was not as hard as some of the others we have . My little dog was able to chew the head down in a matter of hours . I ended up throwing it away because I did n't want him to get a big piece off and swallow it . If your dog 's are not powerful chewers it will be fine , but mine our so it did n't do well in our house .	1
My big dog ( 70 lbs ) absolutely loved this Dinosaur Chew and had it chomped up quickly . I think she is too big for this little chew . I thought it was bigger based on the picture and had it been , may have worked out better . She ate a lot of it and it did not agree with her so we tossed it after it was half gone . I 'm giving 5 stars because my dog really did like it !	1
I thought this would be a little bigger , but that 's okay since my American Pitbull Terrier is only 5 months right now , and my Ridgeback mix is medium sized . This is a great size for small-medium Dogs . It 's an interesting shape and my Moms cairn terrier mix female claimed it right away ! Haha . It 's textured for teeth cleaning and strong for super chewers ! As with any hard chew toy , do keep an eye on your pet while they chew so they do n't hurt a tooth . Ive heard that this can be a problem .	1
This toy gets shared between 3 dogs at my house . A pitt/lab mix , a border collie/dane mix , and a jack russell mix ( who is about 22lbs ) .They all share it , and it 's large enough no one can swallow it or choke on it , and it 's held up several months without them eating it . Well worth the money .	1
For some odd reason I thought these were chewable , which clearly they 're not . I 'm not exactly how sure the dental part works in , I have n't noticed better breath or less tarter . It 's a hard plastic toy , luckily for me my dog knows better than to eat the pieces she chews off , she just spits them out . If your dog isnt that way I wouldnt recommend as it could do inner damage or atleast monitor your dog . Im giving the product 4 stars because it did arrive earlier than expected , it does keep my dog entertained , shes more interested in chewing this toy than furniture . She seems happy with it so im happy .	1
My cat Foutchie is heading toward 5 now and no one told her the trouble with a kitten is it eventually becomes a cat ( so take that Ogden Nash ! ) . She still voom-voom-vooms around at a pace that makes me exhausted . She loves toys , especially stuff she chases . So the bubbles are great full . Especially since they are catnip bubbles . You do n't have the worry about them getting soap on them and making them sick . She love jumping high to pop them.So if you are looking for something to awaken the kitten in your kitty , you might try these .	1
I wanted a safe bubble product for my year old cats . I researched the various `` pet '' bubbles and decided on this one based on product size , cost , and reviews . I received in timely manner in a well packaged box with clear plastic covering the entire bottle . Naturally I smelled the product and did detect a slight spicy scent but a bit of a cleaning product smell as well . The bubble wand is standard as pictured . The bubbles produced are sized from 1 '' to about 3 '' in diameter . Just the right size for kitties to play with . They last a substantial amount of time without bursting and do not leave behind any residue that I have detected . I use them on an outside wood porch . Compared to store brand bubbles these are a bit pricey but find these are some of the best bubbles I have ever purchased and worth the price . Also , the ad states the size is 4 oz . but the bottle states it is 5 oz . I think this one bottle will last throughout the summer and fall season being used for a few minutes each day . My kitties loved playing with these and sometimes required hitting the bubble a couple of times before they burst . My one complaint is that this product is distributed by United Pet Group , Inc. in Ohio but the bottle states this product is made in China . I consider this product worth the cost and would definitely make a repeat purchase but will research for a product made in the USA first .	1
My male cat loves these bubbles , but he loves playing with bubbles anyway . My female just looks and occassionally bats at one of the bubbles . This formula makes LOTS of bubbles ! And it 's thick enough to get three sets of bubbles with one dip . This is sometimes a disadvantage because it seems to overwhelm my cat ! There is a slight smell , but it does n't really bother me ( I 'm very sensitive to chemical smells ) . I only gave 4 stars because I am not sure my cat is more attracted to these bubbles because of catnip . He does n't act the way he does with the herbal catnip ...	1
I know regular bubbles can be just as fun , but I worry the splash of soap in the eye will hurt them if the bubbles break in their faces . They will chase the bubbles and be at attention for as long as I am willing to blow them into the air ! It is a fun toy that we can do with them and I recommend them .	1
I actually bought this product for use by staff at a zoo . They 've discovered it 's not just some of their cats that respond to the bubbles . Their binturong goes absolutely nuts for them , too.And , yes , these bubbles are great fun for house cats , too .	1
The bubbles arrived quickly and were exactly as described . Only downside is that my cats are terrified of bubbles . My dog , on the other hand , thinks they 're amazing . All in all , it 's still fun to use these . Just be care as the liquid is green . Some of it dripped on my cat tower and left a green spot .	1
OH man , who knew cat 's go crazy for bubbles . My cat will easily play bubbles with me for 10 minutes before getting bored . I 've tried normal bubbles and there does seem to be a subtle difference between the catnip ones and regular ones . I would n't go so far as to say these are better than regular catnip .	1
Cool idea ... maybe a cat somewhere would love it ! Just none of mine seemed to care !	1
My two cats just watch me blow bubbles , then eventually get annoyed and walk away . BUT the neighbor cat goes C-R-A-Z-Y for the catnip bubbles . I will most likely keep buying them because he entertains both me and my cats .	1
Posy tends to destroy ALL her toys . However , Quacky is still around as is Sneaky the alligator , RoseAnne , the geek , and Oscar the purple ferret for lack of something else to call him . We 've been very pleased with her toys from Amazon and will continue to buy her toys from there .	1
My lab/border collie mix absolutely adores this toy . She carries it with her everywhere . When someone comes over to visit , she presents this toy to them for their approval and then takes it to her bed . The indented neck makes it easy for a dog to pick up this toy and carry it in their mouth . She has never chewed on it ... .just treasures it ! !	1
Please note that though my dogs are capable of ripping this or any fabric toy to shreds , for reasons only known to them , they do n't do this . ( a Big Retriever Mix & a giant Great Pyrenees mix ) . This squeaky duck is their favorite for fetch and the toy each consistently chooses to initiate a few rounds of big dog wrestle-rumble . The squeaker holds up to a lot of use and this toy does just fine when run through the washer & dryer , if you find your pup or pups tend to & # 34 ; suck & # 34 ; their stuffed animals and thus render them totally funky .	1
Penny got this toy for her birthday . She was overcome with excitement , probably because the toy is bigger than her head . It has lasted longer than 5 minutes which is a major plus .	1
This is the second & # 34 ; Ducky & # 34 ; we purchased for our dog . The first one is still completely intact ( including squeaker ) , but also completely disgusting despite many trips to the laundry . The New Ducky was bought as a replacement but both are hanging around . My dog shows a clear preference for the newer , cleaner one . This is a cute , well made toy for a dog that enjoys keeping the doggie equivalent to security blankets .	1
I 've never seen this at the pet stores and our border collie adores them . He is 7 and has all of his since puppyhood - in varying stages of ick since he plays with them outdoors . Unfortunately , he likes the old `` duckie '' better than a nice new one . They 've held up amazingly well , especially compared to another , pricier , toy from a pet store that started coming apart at the seams immediately . No duckie ever did that . He 's had some other stuffed toys but these are such a favorite that I 've kept a spare . He enjoys the squeaks too although a couple did stop working .	1
End of March and still going strong from x-mas . No tears or damage . Not my dog Favorite toy but they do play with it .	1
Our Lab 's favorite toy ... and uses it to settle down at night before he goes to sleep .	1
Really big and squeaks . Nice toy !	1
This is my second review for Duckworth and I still feel that this duck is worth every penny . It was the favorite toy of our dog that died at age 13 and it is the favorite toy of our 5 yr old dog that we adopted after the first one died . The dogs could n't be more different in personality , but they both have loved this toy to pieces , literally . It does n't get chewed apart but is so well loved that it looks terrible and is starting to fall apart , so we buy two each Christmas and save the second one for mid summer when it is time for a new Duckworth to appear .	1
Super cute and fluffy , just what she likes to play with ! Do n't put it in the washer though ( I did n't see the instructions not to ... ) as the nice fluff turned to tight curls ! Now it looks like a duck with an afro . Dog still loves it though !	1
I bought this as a gift for my parent 's two English Labradors . It 's quite large , and they love to carry it around in their mouths . It 's squeaker makes the standard sound . This toy probably would not hold up well to a chewer , but the labs are not , so it 's perfect .	1
These are quite large so keep that in mind when buying . They are a great toy and I have given them to several dog owners that seem to like them . Seem to be well constructed , too .	1
Purchased this for our 8 year old stuffed animal collector Hailey the Farm Dog . Hailey is not a toy destroyer ( quite the opposite ) and while she has given Duckworth many a massive shake , she mainly appreciates the texture of the fur ( good for licking and nurturing ) and the ability to provide the perfect chin rest for naps ! Duckworth seems to be of excellent quality although we have not washed him so I can not give an opinion of how well he would hold up under those conditions . My suspicion is that Duckworth is NOT for a power chewer and we have taught our terrier to leave it alone : - )	1
My dog loved this toy . He 's a large dog so the large size was great for him . He did rip a hole in it and pull out the squeeker and stuffing in about a day.. but that 's not the toys fault , he 's not very gentle with his toys .	1
I bought this toy for my puppy but did n't give it to him until months later because although he likes big toys ( it 's big for him , he 's a 20 pound dog ) , he also loves squeakers or toys that make fun sounds but this one only has 1 squeaker . When I gave it to him , I thought it would just be a 1 day toy and he would be done with it but 2 months later , this is still his absolute favorite toy . He loves the 1 squeaker and carries his ducky around all the time . This is also one of the few toys he knows by name and will pause and look around every time he gets asked where his ducky is . And he also loves cuddling with his ducky and uses it as a pillow when he sleeps .	1
I received this toy about an hour ago via UPS . I got all excited in front of my Pug Dog , to see what he would do , he also got excited watching me take it out of the plastic wrapping.Well he could not wait and grabbed it before it was all the way out . When I did let go he went nuts over it . Now my dog is in no way deprived of toys he has a few large bags that I rotate . This little duck or should I say large duck is beautiful . It is solidly made and is just perfect . The squeaky does not work as well as I had hoped but I can replace that with not trouble I do it all the time . Not enough to take away a star.When my Buddy started to play with it I can tell how much fun it is , he even tossed it high in the air , that never happened before . They are both resting now , the playtime is over and it is lap time . Tomorrow will be another ducky day of play . I would not hesitate to recommend this toy to everyone ... .	1
I received a free trial sample of this product and found that my dog loves it . She is a very actvive dog and is in great health to begin with . I use this to make a gravy for her kibble .	1
results are awesome if used with high quality dog food sleek athletic muscular bodies considerable conditioning product results as described	1
I like the statistics on this product but my dogs have n't used it long enough to see a difference . Additionally , they eat top quality food and already received other supplements so who knows if I 'll ever see a difference.There have been no negative effects by adding this ( such as gas , runny poo 's , allergic reactions etc ) I have five dogs . Two are picky eaters . This supplement causes the picky eaters to inhale their food . Good stuff !	1
I 'm into the second 5 lb canister now . At first I thought it was a bit expensive , but my dog loves it ( l cup of very warmwater with 3/4 dipper of Nupro Dog Supplement ) . I stopped buying the very expensive $ 52.00 dog kibble and no more canned food , and now by feeding him only Beneful with the Nupro Dog , am actually saving $ 47.00 per month on dog food ! Wonderful . He loves absolutely loves the stuff , and his health is improving .	1
My beagle has a touchy stomach . He loves the taste of this product so far ( number of weeks ) and it avoids runny stool . We will see if he keeps liking it , he sometimes changes . I mix it in with my home cooked chicken or beef with oatmeal , vegetables and broth .	1
My pooch absolutely loves this stuff . I see a noticeable difference in her coat . And no gas ! My pup is ruff ( ha ) and tumble , but NuPro keeps her energized and shiny !	1
Although I did n't order this from Amazon , I highly highly highly recommend this product . I get mine from my local pet store ( when I get a coupon ) but spent a lot of time here reading reviews . I did months of research on different supplements , allergy relief , and all in one solution for my dogs health . I wanted him on Vitamin C to prevent hip problems later on , wanted something to give a healthy coat ( not salmon oil ) and wanted something natural and made in the USA . I can understand the ingredients and the product has been around for years . I am very pleased with it , my dogs allergies are under control , his coat his healthy and shiny , and he has never ending amounts of energy . He feels great , looks great , and acts great . When you add water it makes a great gravy for their food and he spends a lot of time licking the bowl CLEAN . Do n't waste time/money/effort looking at other products , getting crap you see at Petsmart , buy NuPro and let it work . You wont be disappointed .	1
My dogs love the flavor and it even helps cover up the taste of the Dinovite I also give them , which they do not like .	1
This is great supplemental value to a dogs daily needs . I add just the amount for my dogs in their morning meal . So far so good . I am still evaluating it , but seems to be exactly what I wanted for my dogs . Making sure they maximize the need for their sometimes scaley skin , and sometimes thin coat . This seems to keep their skin and coat in super condition .	1
I have 7 dogs ... all different sizes and breeds . I make agravy paste and add it over their dry food . Every single one of them gulps this stuff down -- I 've never had ALL of them love anything as much as this before ! It looks nasty when mixed ( think dirty diaper ) , smells like beef gravy , but it certainly does the trick . Two of my dogs have arthritis and they seem to be improving ( I also give them fish oil and glucosamine ) . My beagle has gone from being barely able to stand up to running around and playing . I 'm waiting to see if it helps with the tear stains on my Bulldog 's face . Too soon to tell . But they all love it and for that reason alone , so do I .	1
My dogs absolutely love the taste of this stuff . It makes a wonderful smelling gravy . I love the fact that I do n't have to give them anything else besides this in addition to their dry food . I do n't know if my dogs would eat their plain food again without this mixed in . I have n't noticed that much difference in their overall health , but they were already in great condition before giving this to them . I just hated having to mix lots of different supplements and yogurt and so on every time I fed them . This makes it wonderfully easy to keep them healthy . And Amazon has the best prices to buy this .	1
I have 2 labs , one of whom had bowel surgery at 5 months and lost part of his intestines . This affects his ability to absorb the nutrients in his food . I started adding this and the Nupro Joint supplement to both of my dogs food . The LOVE this stuff . It makes a nice gravy that my dogs just adore . I ca n't get them to stop licking the bowl when their food is gone.I have no idea if it 's helping or not but the pup is healthy and growing and gaining weight . I ca n't ask for more than that . The fact that this does not have a noxious odor is a HUGE plus for me . It seems to be made with healthy ingredients and is chock full of nutrients . At the very least , it ca n't hurt so I give it to both dogs .	1
I first won a 5-pound can of Nupro at a collie specialty show . The person who donated the gift commented , `` This stuff will grow hair on eggs ! '' Funny . But I 've used it for several years ever since that first can , and my collie 's coat is gorgeous . This is a great product . My dog is 9-1/2 yrs old , looks about 4 , and acts like a puppy . ( You can see him at [ ... ] . ) I wo n't stop adding this to his food .	1
I have been feeding my dogs ( 2 ) this product for about 15 years . Each had/has a beautiful coat and I use Lipiderm with it . No hot spots on my Labs . The dogs have never had any digestive issues with this either .	1
So far , so good with this one ... it does n't smell great but the nutrients and minerals will keep your dog naturally healthy and happy .	1
I should have tired this long ago ! I am seeing good results already and it has only been a few weeks . I have a 5 year old female Yorkie who has skin allergies for over 3 years . In the last year she has tiny bumps on her neck the Depo shot did n't take care of and now the bumps are about gone.My other dogs 5 in all ( 2 more Yorkies and 2 Maltese ) do n't have skin problems , but their skin looks calm..not blotchy . I feed it to them cause it is good for them . As now I see ! They LOVE the taste ! ! ! I do n't put it in their food as a powder or wet like a gravy , cause I do n't want the Maltese 's to get brown stains on their faces . So I make into balls and hand feed like treats they love it , so it do n't take long before their gobbled down . + I can wash my hands easier then I can wash 5 dogs faces.I am hoping to be a long time user ! ! So I will be back to complete this review after a few months . My allergy dog has to take Depo shots , so I 'm hoping Nupro will alleviate the need for that . Time will tell.UPDATE ... 07-31-2012I 'm back and ordered another 5 pounds . Good good stuff ... although it did not help my itchy allergy dog ( grass allergy ) her coat and all 5 dogs coats look awesome . I never seen them look so shiny and their skin just says healthy .	1
We 've been adding this powder to our dogs food for about 5 years now , we 'd never go back they love it so much and it 's improved the quality of their coats incredibly .	1
I read the amazon reviews . and I am now on my second jar . My cat had her head in the jar within seconds of opening the jar . Huge amount for the money . Noticeable difference in my dogs ( three in total ) after a couple of weeks . I would not be without it	1
I have two dogs , a Boston terrier and a maltese mix and I have been making home made dog food for them for almost three years now . Their meals include protein ( meat or chicken ) , oats , a variety of vegetables and sweet potatoes . My vet recommended that I include a supplement such as this and fish oil in their meals . Since I have been feeding my dogs home cooked meals , my Boston who is now seven has a lot less grey hair on his face , both dogs ( my maltese is six ) still act like they are young dogs , and they are both in very good health . While I ca n't attribute this to the powder completely , I do think it works and I do n't see any reason to change their diet now . Also , both dogs seem to like the taste , so that 's a plus .	1
I bought this product to supplement my Siberian husky & # 8217 ; s home cooked diet that is supplemented with high quality kibble . We have been adding Nupro to her 3 daily meals for nearly 2 months now and her coat is noticeably smoother & shinier . Previously she had hotspots around her mouth from licking ; Nupro has almost totally alleviated this . Shockingly , she turned the powder down at first ( we have read reviews that said dogs couldn & # 8217 ; t refuse the smell/flavors ) but now we mix the powder with water and top it onto her food and she can & # 8217 ; t get enough . This is a great product for anyone looking for a top quality dog food supplement .	1
I have a young Weimaraner and his gas post-meals was embarassing.After talking with my vet and experimenting with different solutions , I used this supplement . After acclimating to the supplement , the gas was vastly improved . He has a pretty voracious appetite , but if I sprinkle this powder on top he is more than happy to chow down as usual . There were no negative side effects.As a random note , the scooper in my first container was buried halfway down .	1
Our dogs have been on this product since June 2013 ... and thier coats are incredible ! Shiny and soft ! However , I only give 1 tsp to my 100lbs dogs and 1/2 tbs to my 50lbs or less dogs x2 a day . The scoop in the container is massive . My dogs are also healthier overall .	1
I originally bought nupro as a supplement for a foster dog who had mange . I chose to cook her meals at home and I wanted to supplement her with something to help ensure she was getting everything she needed . Two years at the shelter , suffering from severe demodectic mange leading to major hairloss , and within three weeks of a new diet , she had most of her hair back and was adopted . After the success I saw with her , I bought it for our shar pei . Our shar pei suffers from flea allergies and many other typical pei ailments ( thin coat , skin issues , yeast infections , ear infections , etc ) . It was important to me that it be grain free as we suspect she may have an underlying grain allergy . Nupro fit the bill . This stuff worked WONDERS . Now at 14 months , she has a thick , shiny coat . Our vet was impressed by the improvement in her coat quality , from bald to beautiful . I use it on all of my fosters who are a little under the weather and need a boost . It continues to be a part of my shar pei 's daily regiment and will continue to do so for the rest of her life . I can not say enough good things . I recommend this to those who want a full , healthy coat among the many other benefits it has to offer .	1
my dogs have been using this for years . They seem to like it but I do n't know how effective it is anymore since they have been on it so long and are n't puppies anymore . I 'd recommend it .	1
Taking into consideration that there is no single Perfect supplement for any creature - human or otherwise , Nupro has much to be proud of . Unlike many other supplements Nupro is manufactured here in the United States from first quality sources . Recent findings that Pharmaceutical giant Pfizer.Who has sourced out the manufacturing of Pet-Tabs to India , along with the newly published report by Consumer labs that levels of lead approaching the toxic zone have been discovered.Nupro is based on a whole food concept . You very well could feed your dog nothing but Nupro and expect most nutritional needs to be met . However specific proteins and essential vitamins and trace minerals would be missed.I mention this only to re enforce that although Nupro is n't a replacement for a healthy diet - it can enhance what ever food you are currently feeding your pooch.As a dog lover who has never been without a dog or three for 50 plus years . I have been making my own dog food for over thirty.Long before the was an Internet I was teaching myself all I could about canine nutrition . My self education continues - and I remain highly suspect of any commercial dog food.Especially if you consider that out of literally thousands of brands and sub brands - there are a mere 14 considered safe and healthy . Since the founding of Nupro some 25 years ago there has never been a single instance of a recall , tainted ingredient or other unfortunate mishap.Using palatable desiccated ( powdered ) liver as a base Nupro adds the following:1 ) Kelp - rich in trace minerals and iodine Kelp is proven to improve glandular functions and provide a rich source of natural vitamins A , B1 , B2 , C , and E.2 ) Amino Acids and Enzymes - proven to strengthen the immune system in dogs and humans.3 ) Flax Seed - Great source of Omega 3 Fats . Unlike fish oils no smell and what is more , no chance of mercury.4 ) Lecithin - long applauded for it 's effect on brain , nerve and healthy liver function.5 ) Allicin ( highly condensed garlic oil ) Proven to fight cardiovascular disease . A powerhouse of anti oxidants.6 ) Lactobacillus Acidophilus - Helps regulate the digestive system , reduces gas , bloating and stomach upset . Can compliment the use of whole fat yogurt for those who use it.Nupro is in powdered form and does not need to be refrigerated . Over the past year , I have exchanged emails with founder and she is eager to answer any questions and support any claims with factual studies and information.My only real concern with Nupro is that I believe the initial dose recommendations are far too excessive.The company would benefit by adding label information addressed to those dogs with sensitive stomachs and or digestive problems.But common sense should prevail . Never overload a new ingredient to any dogs diet . Acclimation should be reduced to the smallest denominator.Rather than one large scoop ( included ) I would advise a teaspoon at most for dogs over 50 lbs and significantly less for smaller dogs . For finicky eaters Nupro can be mixed with a little warm water to make a gravy - and who does n't like gravy ? By adding Nupro to your dogs diet you can expect to see:1 ) Dramatic improvement in the coat . More shine and less shedding.2 ) Less stomach upset3 ) Firmer stools4 ) Higher balanced behavior and more energy5 ) Improved breathNupro is an excellent time proven product.Used conservatively in the beginning both you and your beloved pooch and or pooches should experience an overall improvement in many areas of your dogs overall health and well being .	1
I first heard about this product when my beagle was dying from mast cell cancer . A blog I came across recommended I give this to her . While she did n't make it , I could n't help but notice the shiny coat this product gave her . I now feed this to my golden retriever , and I have from 8 weeks of age . He LOVES the stuff , and he definitely sheds less when on Nupro . One thing I 've noticed , however , is when starting him on a batch of this stuff ( after a few months of hiatus ) , his breath will REEK . I 'm not sure what to do about it ... as the Orapup does n't seem to take the smell away . After a few weeks , however , his breath is back to normal . Very good product ! Highly recommended .	1
I came across this product while researching kelp to decrease plaque and tartar on my Sheltie . 2 months later , my sister 's 3 dogs ( ahem , children ) and my mom 's pooch are on this supplement . I guess the most astonishing thing we 've seen is this : Georgia is a 15 year old cocker mix who had become pitiful looking . First of all , she was covered in these wart like things -- -literally covered . The vet would express some of them , but nothing took them away . She is my sisters dog and I would not even touch her because the warts grossed me out . Secondly , she had lost so much oh her hair that we called her baboon butt and her tail looked like the Grinches Christmas tree . Seriously , you could hold it up and it had a few scraggly hairs hanging off a bald tail . Thirdly , she was very gray . So , I had not seen Georgia in about a month and when she walked in I thought my sister had a new dog . Georgia 's is now a luscious , glossy black ( except for her face ) her fur is thick , soft and her tail fur is completely full . It truly is mind blowing and I would not have believed it had I not seen it . Her warts are almost completely gone and she has so much energy . I swear her eyesight and hearing are better but my sis does not agree with that . As far as my 9 year old Lily- she acts like a 2 year old now . My sisters other 2 dogs have the softest , silkiest fur you have ever seen and are the picture of health . Just started my moms buddy on this and sending some home with my brother for his Romeo . If I could but stock in this company I would . Oh- in terms of Lily 's plaque ? Gone , period . And I could not even break it off with a scraper . We actually make homemade dog food ( chicken , kale , sweet potato , broccoli , etc . no grain ) and I just mix this in as I process it , freeze and pull out daily . We do n't give the pets a scoop a day- a teaspoon for the little guys , a tablespoon for my 30 pounder.We are all joking that we humans are going to start taking this !	1
I have been using Nupro Dog Supplement for about a year now . Originally , I was making my own dog food and needed a supplement . Now I have found a dry dog food that my fussy-stomached German Shepherd can eat . I still add Nupro to his and my other dogs food daily . I can say for sure that it helps for a shiney coat , but mostly I feel confident that my dogs are getting all the nutritional benefits that they need . I have found no adverse effects and my dogs absolutely LOVE love it ! Sometimes I just make a gravy out of the Nupro as a special treat for my dogs .	1
My dogs are n't a fan of it , so I have to mix it in their food a little bit for them to eat it . Anyway I have noticed their coats are better and they have more energy . Definitely a good buy over something like Dinovite , since this stuff is basically the same thing but far cheaper .	1
Our dogs love it . We rescued two woofs and one of them was severely abused . Mange , fungal infection , abuse , no fur ... horrible skin . Dr. told us that he probably would n't get his fur back . The rescue folks suggested Nupro Gold as they 've seen wonders with this product . It 's hard to say if his fur would have grown back on it 's own ( and some of it on his face did not return ) without the supplement , but we did use it and his coat is now beautiful . We are continuing to use it .	1
I have 2 Basenjis . Our 1st one started losing his hair in circles with little scabs underneath . We took him to the vet 5 times , scrapings were done , negative , blood & stool , negative . He was looking very puny , my gorgeous red/white Basenji . On top of this we were waiting for the day we would become parents to a Basenji pup . However , we had an amazing breeder , and he told us about Nupro gold , and we promised to continue with it in his diet . Naturally we followed directions for Charley . Miraculously within a month his coat was back more beautiful than before . I recommend this to all dog owners . My dogs love the taste . It is keeping my boys in great shape .	1
I have a blue nose pit with skin conditions due to allergies . I stopped letting her eat all the stuff she is allergic to months ago but her skin still had n't cleared up . She had eaten rocks a few times which told me that she was lacking some minerals . I ordered this product and have been giving it to her for almost 2 weeks and she looks gorgeous and has n't eaten any rocks . Also she had always been trying to eat anything and everything she get her little paws on and now she does n't act like she 's starving , likely due to getting the vitamins and minerals she needs.She looks gorgeous and seems very content . I add some water to it to make it like a gravy and pour it over her food . She loves it . I will always feed her this.The ingredients are top notch ; i will definitely reorder when I run out .	1
My dog loves this . It makes a nice gravy for his food . He loves the taste . I havent had it long enough to say how beneficial it will be but I have only heard great things .	1
Nupro addresses joint and skin issues from the inside out . It 's a wonderful supplement we use regularly , along with Solid Gold 's Sea Meal . It helps keep our dogs looking their best , for the many shows and events we attend . Their coats are shiny and healthier , which is the main reason we use it . My dogs are picky eaters . They will not readily take a powdered supplement , but I have found that Nupro is different . It is liver-flavored , and that makes a HUGE difference , at least from the dog 's standpoint . My dogs do n't like this in a wet or gravy form , so I have found that by adding just enough water ( one or two tbsps ) , and stirring well , the powder will coat and stick to their kibble . When I do this , they readily gobble it down . Note : most dogs seem to really like the taste , but there are a few that may not like it or be put off from the garlic smell . Our neighbor 's dog does n't seem to care for it . If that 's the case , I recommend Solid Gold 's Sea Meal , which is another great supplement , and perhaps an alternative .	1
Our adult dog seems to really benefit from taking this . If we 're traveling and he misses a few days , when he jumps down from the sofa he yelps when he lands . When taking this he does n't so I think it 's helping . I sprinkle it on his food and add some water to make a gravy .	1
good for my dogs joints and also lots of vitamins , makes my dogs coats soft and seems to keep them healthy , been buying this for a while now	1
I first purchased this product about two months ago after noticing my six-year-old Boxer starting to show the first signs of hip dysplasia . He would struggle a bit to get up after lying down for a while and would typically showcase a light limp for the first few minutes after standing . After monitoring him for about two weeks to make sure it was n't a mild sprain and seeing the condition neither improve or get worse , I started him on both this Nupro supplement andVetri-Science Laboratories Methylsulfonylmethane 250 Supplement for Dogs , 120 Count . After a couple of weeks , I noticed a marked improvement in my Boxer . He no longer struggled at all to get up and the limp was entirely gone . Since I began giving him both supplements , I 've only seen him limp twice after waking up , and both times were after naps following particularly strenuous play sessions at the local dog park.I ca n't say for certain whether it was the Nupro , the Methylsulfonylmethane , or the combination of the two that did the trick , but I can say that my dog no longer shows any signs of suffering from hip dysplasia at all.As another note , both of my dogs absolutely love Nupro . My Boxer would occasionally skip meals before I started him on this supplement , but since I did he has only skipped one , and that was on a day when he had an upset stomach . The same goes for my German Shepherd . They both vigorously chow down every meal now . So I suppose Nupro could also work if you have difficulty getting your dog to put on weight . To avoid a mess , I typically put the Nupro in their food , then add water and shake . If you leave the food in powder form it tends to end up all over your dog 's face.Finally , for all the good things about this supplement , it is quite pungent . Be prepared .	1
Have a GSD and I highly recommend this product . I do n't make the gravy as recommended because she does n't like wet food . I have found that it is just as effective if you sprinkle the supplement dry over the food . It also seems to have something that encourages the dogs to lick their bowl clean !	1
This supplement has helped our pugs and past giant breeds to stave off arthritic pain in knees and hips . They think it 's fantastic & # 34 ; gravy & # 34 ; and jump in the air for their supper . Just a bit on the food with water makes it taste nice ( according to the pugs ) . Have used this for many years .	1
We 've had our three dachshunds on Nupro Joint formula for over a year , now . We sprinkle a bit on their dry food ( Solid Gold ) in the morning and evening , and then add a bit of warm water to make a `` gravy . '' They LOVE it ! Being doxies , all three have had back problems of one kind or another . Dax , our `` old lady '' ( 10 years ) , has been incapacitated to the point that we had to give her a cortisone shot and sedate her in order to give her time to heal . She also used to have a chronic problem with the hair follicles on her coat getting infected , which required washing with a medicated shampoo . Even then , she had a very poor coat with a moth-eaten appearance . Not a very nice look for an otherwise beautiful dappled girl ! But we 've experienced none of these problems since we 've started the Nupro/Solid Gold combo . All three coats ( two smooth ; one long-hair ) are full and shiny , and the only back problem we 've experienced was a pinched nerve on my rambunctious boy , Ro , after taking a leap from our bed -- a place he had no business getting up to in the first place . Even that problem was short-lived , and he made a full recovery after a vet trip for a small run of anti-inflammatories.I highly recommend using a quality food and supplementing with the Nupro . Once you get your dogs to where they are healthy and shiny , you only need a light sprinkle on a meal to keep 'em going . We feed three small dogs twice a day , and a 5Lb container lasts us months .	1
Recommended by my vet in Connecticut 4 years ago and would not be without it for my Sheltie . A wonderful natural joint supplement I give my dog once a day at lunchtime as recommended by my vet . Loves the liver flavor and I love the results . Keeps him agile and active and ready for ALL activities . WILL NOT BE WITHOUT THIS PRODUCT .	1
I just received these and have n't used them . But shipment was fast and a very good price . If I have a problem I will repost .	1
I have been giving this to my 2 dogs for about a month and their hair is so much softer than before . My pug hair was kind of rough on the back and now it has become super soft . My boxer hair has become shinier as well but i have to put him on less amount because it was too much for his digest system . He was having diarrhea until i cut back on this to half and now he is all good and healthy . Both dogs appear to have more energy and i would definitely recommend this to anyone .	1
A serving is around a 1/4 cup for a 40-lb dog . We went through it faster than I expected . You have to mix it with water , so it 's a little messy .	1
If this is what folks say about giving your dog more zeal to enjoy getting up and being active again , this seems to do the job for a dog I have who has wobblers . He seems much more active and wanting to play more than before he had this added to his meals . Almost like normal .	1
As per my review for the Nupro nutritional supplement , this stuff is great . I have no idea if it will help the dogs ' joints or not but since I take glucosamine and chondroitin for my joints , I figure it is a good idea . My labs are pretty hard on their joints . They love to run and jump . I am hopeful that early supplementation will prolong their joints . This stuff makes my labs very happy ! They love the taste and I do not find the smell to be objectionable . It smells like real food to me . I buy it monthly now and intend to continue .	1
I bought this supplement to help a friend 's dog who was ailing and unhealthy from poor nutrition . The dog LOVES the Nupro and his health has greatly improved . I feel Nupro to my own dogs and believe that it keeps them in great health . The shipping was fast too . Great on line purchase .	1
We use tablets for supplements for our dogs and have for years . We needed something for our older dogs who had problems with the tablets and/or size . This was easy to just sprinkle on the food and the dogs liked the taste . I would recommend this product to anyone looking for a little extra support to your senior dogs .	1
I 'm giving it 4 stars because I like the contents , and the nutrients it provides . Unfortunately , my dog seems to despise the flavor . Once I finish this jug , I wo n't be ordering more . I do n't know what he does n't like about it , but I have to cover it with wet food or yogurt to get him to eat it . I guess I 'll be going back to separate vitamin , glucosamine , probiotics and fish oil supplements . Yay .	1
helps my dog with his arthritis . He does like when I add some water and make it like a gravy .	1
I love using Nupro Joint supplement with our big foster pups ! They love the taste and I love knowing that I 'm giving them a supplement without synthetic ingredients . I also love that even families who may have never given supplements to a dog can easily use this and it 's economical , even for big dogs .	1
Both my Malamute and my Lab ate this for the last three years of their lives . One lived to 13 and the other to 15 and thier joints were actually good . They moved around well and liked this taste of this stuff . It was recommend by a friend and I was glad that it was .	1
This product is great . The shipping was great . So far this has lasted me 2 months and going.I have a 15 yr old dog who get 's this with his food 4-7 days per week on top of his 1 supplement pillandI will definitely buy again in the next 33 days .	1
We saw improvement in our 12 yr old dog within 20-30 days . She has better mobility and goes out with our two puppies and plays more often .	1
My dog and I really like Nupro Joint Support . This delivers the great nutrition she needs in the form of a little gravy which she loves . I have researchedother glucosamine products , and this joint powder is the hands-down best for quality and cost , and ease of serving .	1
This product is brand name and is a wonderful value on Amazon . Nupro literally saved our dog 's life and us lots of money . She had a slipped disk in her back 10 years ago . Now she is 13 and doing well . No surgery , no meds ! We ran out of Nupro and I tried another brand , within a month or two , she was limping and leg giving out . In two days , she was back to normal .	1
GREAT PRICE FOR THE QUANTITY . RETAIL STORES ARE VERY EXPENSIVE WITH THIS PRODUCT . THIS IS THE SECOND TIME WE PURCHASED THIS FOR OUR DOGS .	1
We have been using this for less then a week and our 14 year old Pit Bull X is running around like a 9 year old ! ! ! She had been starting to make ALLOT of cracking noises while stretching , especially in her neck and we noticed her slowing down . Within 2 days the cracking sound is gone and she is able to go for family walks again and keep up with her 4 year old Catahoula brother . Added bonus is that she LOVES the taste of the gravy that you get when you add water to the powder ... I ca n't recommend this product enough and will be ordering the 20 lb once the 5 lb container is finished .	1
My 8 year old Akita was limping whenever she 'd get up , and particularly bad after a long walk or hike ( she 'd be in pain , so I had to give her tramadol ) .I ordered this and some MSM from Amazon and purchased a couple bottles of additional glucosamine/chondroitin from Costco . Gave her two scoops of Nupro Joint , mixed with 1/2 tsp MSM crystals , and two crushed glucosamine/chondroitin pills and a couple cups of warm water once a day , and the effects were immediate . Within a week the limpness and stiffness were completely gone and she no longer cried after an intense workout . I now give her the same combo , but with just one scoop of Nupro.Not sure which of the three to thank for this ( the Nupro has a bit of everything , I just supplemented the main ingredients with more of everything ) , but it definitely worked for my old girl.Another odd effect was that it ( the combo ) completely cured her occasional incontinence . She has grain allergies , so we keep her on a very strict diet and it helps dramatically , but every once in a while , after swimming and drinking excess water , she 'd have a little leakage . Not a drop since she 's been on these supplements . She did have am odd reaction to the MSM ( I think ) when I first started her on it . Her hind legs got a rash and were really itchy after a couple days , so I stopped for a week , and started her back on very gradually when the rash subsided . I 've read that could mean that toxins were exiting her body . She handles everything well now , and has a ton of energy and mobility . Oh , and she absolutely loves the taste .	1
We have only been using this since Dec 10 for our dogs . So far it seems to help with their joint issues . We have both large and small dogs . We are not sure that it helps keep the same & # 34 ; coat quality & # 34 ; as the nupro gold label ... but we are giving this some adjustment time to see how it works . We have been very pleased with all the Nupro products that we have purchased in the past ... and expect nothing less from this one !	1
Been using this for years and its nice to have it shipped to the house . Do n't know if it really makes a difference anymore , but it ca n't be hurting for a 12 year old lab with bad hips	1
I use this product for my own two German Shepherds . We belong to the Oklahoma Working Dog Association which includes another 20 or more dogs , and the members share a lot of feedback about various supplements used for our dogs . Many of these dogs compete in Schutzhund sport , so they need to be in top physical condition . I personally was using a more expensive joint supplement than Nupro for a couple years , but my dogs coats started looking shabby . A couple other `` club '' friends said they were going back to using an `` old standby '' -- Nupro -- so I ordered some for my dogs . Now the dogs ' coats are shiny and healthy -- looking show worthy ! My 6-year-old 95 pound male ( all muscle , not fat ! ) is taking the jumps and hurdles and running like a puppy with absolutely no sign of joint discomfort.We and several friends feed our dogs a homemade diet . Therefore , we are very careful to include appropriate levels of vitamins and minerals as additives . The Nupro silver provides a quite complete array of nutrients . Also , the Nupro company was very helpful when we requested more information than was found on the product label . They quickly sent a detailed and complete list of the ingredients in this product . I was impressed with their openness and helpfulness.In all -- very highly recommended supplement !	1
We have been using this stuff for years . The vet clinic I worked at started selling it and I was hooked . Has a great smell and the dogs love it . You do not always have to make the gravy as our dogs just lick it out of their bowls . I recommend this stuff for anyone who has a large breed dog , whether they have orthopedic issues or not . I start all our labs on this as puppies .	1
I have been buying this for a few years and love it . The dogs love it , it makes the food taste more yummy I guess . I incorporate it into their raw diet , it makes me feel better that they are getting a vitamin made from food ( not synthetic ) along with the joint support .	1
I noticed both of my dogs gained weight while on this . I found the weight gain to offset the health benefit , so I stopped giving them this supplement.They have since returned to their normal weight . Both dogs are small dogs , a 12lb Lhasa Apso , and a 22lb mutt . On the supplement , both dogs gained 3 lbs .	1
I just got my second one of these.. My dog insisted . He loves to eat again and he runs around like he 's a puppy . This stuff works . If you have an older dog , I found that one third of a scoop per meal keeps him s p r y. I have a 65 pound Labrador .	1
I 've used this product for quite a while , and also turned my in-laws onto it for their dog . It makes a nice gravy over dry food that the dogs love . Unfortunately , my senior dog has a heart issue and the sodium level in this product is too high . I would think being marketed for senior dogs , Nupro would restrict the sodium a little more , but for a healthy adult dog , it 's good stuff .	1
I feed my dogs raw rather than kibble and they are all sporting dogs ( border collies that have 'jobs ' ) . They all like the gravy that this makes ( except one picky female who will not eat it every day but will eat/ drink it most days ) .I do n't know if I 've noticed any significant improvement in coat or performance but I know they were missing important nutrients and the glucosamine in this alone is one of the reasons I got it .	1
I ca n't really tell when koi are happy , but I do know that they gobble this food quickly . This is all I have fed them for the past 3 years . Of my 16 original koi , I have ALL of them , so apparantly the food is doing its job . They have grown from 2 inches to almost a foot , and all seem fat and healthy . You should get this for your koi .	1
This product is a high quality fish food . I notice the other reviewer refers to it as & # 34 ; Vibrance & # 34 ; which this is NOT - Vibrance has a red/yellow color enhancement additive which this does not . This means that if your koi or goldfish are white that this is a better product than Vibrance so that your fish do not get a yellowish cast to them which Vibrance will definitely do . I follow a 3 food rule - which means I feed all my pets and animals 3 different kinds of food at every feeding - this variety , as long as all are good quality foods , helps to ensure health and reduces vitamin deficiences . One of the things I like most about using TetraPond floating sticks ( Vibrance , Spring/Fall and this food here which is a summer food ) is that the sticks soften fairly quickly which makes these foods more easily eaten by all sizes of the koi and goldfish . I have seen immature goldfish suck in a stick with no problem , as well as younger koi . These does not happen with many of the pellet foods which are simply too large and do not soften that much . I would recommend this food for summer feedings , not for spring and fall - make sure you choose a food that is listed for spring/fall as they are wheat based rather than corn and much more easily digestable in colder water .	1
My koi love this product and ca n't wait to gobble it up . It keeps our pond clean longer as there is less waste produced .	1
Best value anywhere.My koi love it and are very healthy w/this-They eat so much every day this is the best way to buy it-This and Tetra freeze dried jumbo krill in the 14 oz size from Amazon is all I feed them	1
Who knows whether this is better than other Koi feed . For me , I 'll rely on the recommendations of those who have used it over a number of years . I also like the way it is packaged , which is airtight and very convenient .	1
I 've been using this pond food for several years and all my fish seem to enjoy these pellets . This is the only food I give them .	1
I have tried other brands of Koi sticks , but my kois love this brand . the bucket is huge and I fill my smaller container from this on a weekly basis . I plan to order more when this one is finished . I noticed a difference in the growth rate of my koi as well , as they have responded so well since eating this brand-they are now huge and healthy !	1
Very solid food . Will probably last an entire summer in the size , and the bucket is rainproof . My fish seem to like it a lot and it does n't cloud the water . I ca n't say it 's `` improved the color of the fish '' as they claim , but I kind of find those claims dubious no matter who makes it so they can have a pass on that . Besides , I did n't exactly have a batch of control fish to measure against , so maybe it has.I 'd recommend this food .	1
I have been using this food for years . Great color for my koi fish . Some are over 18 inches in length , having been raised entirely on Tetra . Well over ten years , coming to think of it , I have bought many large quantities of this food . It is very consistent , always best quality . The koi love it . They eat it enthusiastically .	1
When you have 3 labs and and Irish Wolfhound , It 's almost impossible to find a chew bone that has a chance . The smaller ones are just snacks , but the big ones are so expensive at the pet stores . I bit the bullet and bought one of these and 2 of the Nylabone Durachew Monster ( 2 Pack ) . I know nothing lasts forever but these may have a fighting chance . After a month , they barely have a dent on them . We 'll see .	1
My dog seems to enjoy chewing on this toy , and it 's hilarious to watch him carry it around . I mean look at it ! Clearly the nylabone did not look too carefully at this ... err bone.It 's excellent . Bought one for each of my dog owning friends !	1
We 've had rottweilers , pit bulls , corgi 's , mutts , etc . and this is the ONLY bone that is indestructible to them . My dog has had her bone for almost 5 years and it 's only half gone . I do n't know what it 's made of but it keeps them busy for quite a bit of time and it wo n't get destroyed .	1
Once you get over the errr ... provocative shape you 'll find a heavy duty bone . This is the ONLY bone I will leave in her crate . She is a super chewer and has whittled down the tip of this to a point but it has not broken off as any large pieces . This bone is the safest bone we own . We have had it for 6 weeks now and it 's still going strong . I actually just bought a second one to keep in the kitchen . She has other nylabones ( I only buy her the hard plastic ones and I always buy the biggest size available ) but this is the only one I leave in her crate .	1
I have two dogs . One is a mix an one is a pure Brittney . They both enjoy chewing on them . I like them as they last longer then the other Nylabone shapes .	1
This bone is super . Nylabones are wonderful chew toys for dogs that are truly dedicated to the chewing game . We are on our second galileo bone , but it stands up to hours upon hours of consistent chewing . Small pieces are shaved off by the dog 's chewing , so you should definitely supervise your dog with this toy , as with all toys . But it 's a great , tough toy for chewing dogs !	1
Nylabone has excellent products and this is no exception . My dogs are chewers and Nylabones can withstand the constant chewing without ever getting destroyed . They last a very long time & my dogs love them . Highly recommend .	1
I have two medium-sized dogs who each have one of these . The Souper size lasts them for many months as they are power chewers . The smaller sizes only last a few weeks . This is hard but not as hard as a real beef bone and is kinder to teeth and gums . They also enjoy just carrying these around in their mouths , but I have to be careful I do n't get one dropped on my bare foot ! These do n't break off in litle pieces or slivers and are easy to clean if my dogs play with them in the dirt . I will definitely buy these again .	1
I so want to buy nice squeaky toys for my two Bernese Mountain Dogs . But alas it is not to be . The male has been known to tear apart expensive , indestructible , for powerful chewers , you all the fun toys in minutes . Which leaves me nylabones or kongs . Both of them seem to prefer the Galileo to the other nylabone products . They chew after every meal and these tend to last about a year . There will be little white stuff on your carpets and also in their poop . The bones get sharp and are trip hazards but save the furniture and seem to be good for their teeth . My Berners give these two paws up ! !	1
My 60 lb . pitty mix demolishes everything in minutes usually . Nothing lasts & it gets frustrating to pay so much money on toys that do n't last a week ( or sometimes only minutes ) . I spent more at a local pet store for this Galileo chew & it lasted at least 9 mos or so , which is almost unheard of . Both of my dogs love this so I just bought 2 more . I got a littler one for the little dog which was a mistake cuz the bigger dog keeps getting a hold of it . The little dog ( 17 lbs ) can chew the corner of the bigger bone so I 'll just buy the bigger size from now on . But they both love chewing on this toy . Unfortunately the big dog always brings this to me to throw . I refuse , since it would be like throwing a good sized rock in the house . The only downside is the small rice sized droppings that get left on the carpet from them chewing . They are pokey enough to hold on to the carpet really well & are hard to vacuum up . I see that Amazon has a better price & will be getting my next ones from Amazon .	1
When our dog plays with this thing she throws it in the air and when it lands it sounds like she just threw a brick . Minus the loud nature of this toy it is great , our dog is a powerful chewer and she can put bite marks into it but that 's about all . We have had this toy for about 5 months and it is still intact but with hundreds of bite marks in it . I would strongly recommend NOT stepping on this . Overall this is a durable toy that our dog loves .	1
I bought this as a stocking stuffer ( yes , for my dogs ! ) for Christmas and my 15 lb Bichon Frise and 8 lb Maltese love it so far . It 's also held up so far . We have other plastic bones from this same brand so I think it will last awhile .	1
A great Chew Bone . Very heavy and it seems to be standing up well to my 2 Golden Retrievers ' tough chewing .	1
Keep your toes out of the way - it 's heavy and it 's very hard . We had a GSD years ago who loved his , now our current puppy has turned out to be a power chewer and I decided to try it . She is medium sized at 35 lbs , so I dared to get the big one and she loves it ! I know it will last a long time , but I did move it to the yard due to the noise factor of her dropping it on the had floor - fine with her , we keep quieter toys inside and this is a definite favorite of hers . ***** I had to cave in and order her a smaller one , the souper size is a lot of fun for our dog , but the way she tosses it around it 's downright dangerous sometimes . Stand back and let her at it . So the smaller one turned out to be good , she loves it and I get to keep my toes .	1
This is a great chew product . The particular shape seems to appeal to my dog . He plays with it - does n't just chew it - so he has more fun . It is lasting a long time . I have an 8 month old terrier/ pit bull/ not sure what else mix . He is an `` aggressive chewer '' . This is worth the cost if your aggressive chewer needs an outlet ! As a bonus - it is latex-free and good for their dental health .	1
Nylabone is just the best . Our yellow lab has been working on this Galileo for well over two months . Anything smaller for her chewing habits is gone in less than a week . I highly recommend this for anyone who has a dog who gets bored just laying around and `` wants to be doing something . '' Best thing about these Nylabones are you can boil them in water to take away any smell that might come about with a little `` age '' if your dog likes to take their time with something this size . The worse thing about this is that after constant chewing , you get the little `` plastic spikes '' that are created on the bone ... and let me tell you what ... this thing is NO FUN to step on in the dark when it has been chewed on-a-plenty ! Highly recommend ! ! !	1
My dog chewed the heck out of his other nyla bone till it was a nub that would just destroy your feet . So glad I got this , he really likes it and it is a nice , substantial size ( even if it is shaped a liiiittle funny : P ) that he can really grip in his paws and go at . It will be saving our chair legs from further damage , wish I 'd gotten it sooner though !	1
I have tried numerous bones and chew toys without success . My 90 lb Lab/Pit mix is a heavy chewer who has destroyed just about everything I gave him . Even the heavy rubber Black Kong Extreme he was able to conquer . I ordered the Galileo Bone based on many positive reviews . Initially I thought the price was high , $ 14.00 bucks for a dog bone ? This thing is huge and will outlast 10 cheaper ones . My dog loved it ! It has a chicken flavor that made it irresistible . He chewed it for over an hour straight barely making a mark in it . This bone will last a long time and is worth the price .	1
This is a bit large for a Jack Russell , however , she has been going to town on it and giving it a good workout . It is fairly durable , she has made some marks in it so I do n't let her chew it too long or often , but it is well worth the price to keep her occupied and not chewing on me .	1
Our black lab puppy demolishes most toys within a few minutes . The only toys to stand up to her jaw so far have been this bone , KONG Classic Kong Dog Toy , Large , Red , andHartz Ruff Rewards Dog Toy for Strong Chewers , Bacon Flavor - Large ( 50+ lbs . ) .We 've had this bone for almost 4 months now , and it still has maybe another 6-8 months in it . She has only managed to get little specks off at a time , so it seems quite harmless . She 'd go through other Nylabones much quicker.My only complaints are that as you get tougher with the Nylabones , they get harder ( as opposed to a rubbery material like the Kong toys ) . So be prepared for a very solid , plasticky bone . I just weighed her bone ( she was a little confused ) and it was still about 10 oz . It does n't seem like a lot , but it can definitely hurt when dropping-at-your-feet accidentally becomes dropping-ON-your-foot . It also makes quite a noise on hard wood floor . Finally , it gets very prickly as it gets chewed on , which makes it a little more painful when it meets your foot . But I guess this is a trade off for a durable bone when it is n't a rubbery material.So , overall we are happy with the bone . Our dog loves it ( a little too much when we find it in our bed ) and it has lasted a while . We 'll probably buy another one when it 's gone . It is just unfortunate that it is so heavy/loud at times.Hope this was helpful . Leave a comment if there are any questions I can answer about this bone . Thanks !	1
The dog loves it , but I have to hide it when guests come over otherwise it looks like my dog is walking around with a _____ in her mouth .	1
I have a English Bull Terrier/Pit Bull cross that is a VERY aggressive chewer . She makes short work of most everything but I order these repeatedly - they last a week + and she seems to really enjoy them.Warning -- horrible if you accidentally step on or kick this thing with bare feet in the night !	1
We have a 150 lb English mastiff who can chew through anything . He loves this bone and he has had it for a bit of time now . Our dog is 5 and he has gone through 2 of these bones in his lifetime . Really great quality and highly recommend .	1
My Pit Bull loves it . It offers him plenty of hard chewing time . A good design helps him to hold on while chewing . The bone does get a little jagged after long use . I will get him a new one long before he gnaws it down .	1
I do n't know what it is about the Galileo , but my American Bulldogs looooove it . They will actually fight over it . I do n't know whether its the shape or flavor or what . I usually get them Nylabones dura chews ( as they are strong chewers ) and this holds up about as well ( though it is hard to gauge as they really chew this one so much more ) . The biggest size is much larger than the second largest size , so despite the big price jump I still think its worth it .	1
I have two dogs who LOVE Nylabones . They have at least 30 Nylabones and they still get excited when they get a new one . This Galileo is my Chocolate Labrador 's favorite toy . He is a dog who needs to be occupied otherwise he will eat anything in sight and this toy keeps him occupied for a long time . He has a very strong jaw and this Toy seems to be invincible . I would say that this is the perfect toy for a large dog who has a strong jaw . I would not recommend it for a dog who has small or fragile teeth because this is a very heavy and hard toy and I think potentially it could hurt the teeth of a smaller dog . Also , Keep in mind that since this toy is heavy it could potentially scratch your floor when your dog drops it out of its mouth . We have both Hardwood and Tile floors and I have n't had any issues yet but it does make quite a large bang when it hits the floor .	1
this is a great chew toy . our dog , biggie , loves gnawing on this thing . it 's tough and durable and has lasted a long time and looks like it 's got at least another year or too .	1
this is a heavy chew , so heavy the mastiff was discouraged , I had to chop into it with a cleaver and rub peanut butter in it to encourage chewing .	1
I have a Doberman that can chew like crazy and destroy a lot of things . This bone holds up to the task and it 's also easy to clean ! Just use your dish washer ( I use a sanitize setting in the dishwasher ) and it comes out bright white and clean ( like new ) !	1
I bought my golden retriever his first Galileo bone about 4 years ago . He *loves* this bone , and it is the only bone he has repeatedly gone back to over the years ( and believe me , this spoiled dog has been able to sample just about every bone ever made ) . It 's impossible to break off large chunks , so it takes a very long time for it to wear down . I finally just bought him his 2nd bone a few weeks ago , and the original one is probably still a third of its original size . He chews on it 5-6 nights every week , while the rest of his bones collect dust . I ca n't recommend it enough , especially for those `` power chewers '' . I do n't know what they do to the bones to retain the flavor , but it works ! Do n't let the expensive price tag fool you -- they last for years.Update 10/5/10 : Believe it or not , my dog still loves this bone ! I 've gone through another two in the last few years , but how could I not have one for him ? He chews on it virtually every day . I 'm glad to see the price has gone down a bit since I first started buying them .	1
I have three large mixed breed dogs who are extremely powerful chewers and after much trial and error , I would never buy any other brand except Nylabone . Nothing else lasts as long and occupies them as Nylabone does . They always fight over this one in particular - perhaps they like it because it is much larger than all their other Nylabones . This is definitely the largest one I have seen , so I would only recommend this for someone with a large dog . I would recommend anything Nylabone if you want your dogs to chew a toy instead of your furniture !	1
Nylabone chews are one of the few brands that can withstand the incessant chewing of my pit bull mix . This toy is great , but it seems to be a bit too large . I bough the Souper because it 's designed for dogs 50+ lbs , but after the initial & # 34 ; new toy must chew & # 34 ; feeling my dog has n't had much interest . I think the wolf size would be more comfortable to chew .	1
I did n't think my Great Dane or Hound mix would like a bone made of Nylon but surprisingly they both enjoy it . It is is a good size for the hound ( 50 pounds ) but the Dane could use something bigger , unfortunately I think this is the biggest size .	1
My dogs love this bone and it 's flavor , it is a little bigger than what I thought it would be . They used to make these in a smaller size that were perfect for my beagles . They still love this thing and chew on it , but it is slightly awkward because of the size .	1
I find very few things my pitt mix wo n't chew to pieces . he destroys most rope toys or other normal dog toys in minutes . i 've had this for month and he loves chewing on it . this is my first time using the product and i did n't realize that shards of the plastic come off the bone . and in the beginning my dog 's gums bled a bit from it - like a human when flossing . i 'm told this is ok and good for them ( like flossing ) .	1
First Impression : Man it was time for a new Nylabone . Mom and Dad bought me my first two almost 5 months ago ! They were looking a little nasty , but I still loved them . The kind folks over at Nylabone sent me a gift box and I got to try out this new monster of a chew bone . Now it is shaped a little weird , but I like it none the less . Every time Mom and Dad eat lunch or dinner I lay down and chew on a Nylabone . It keeps me entertained while they eat that amazing smelling human food ... I just close my eyes and pretend.Conclusion : Great chew bone ! Lasts a very long time . Not sure what could be improved .	1
My hairdresser 's dog has allergies and Galileo bones are the only bones the dog can chew without getting sick . The Galileo bones last along time also and that helps my wallet !	1
At first I wondered if it came with batteries . My dog loved chewing on it and I had to finally remove it when it got too small and jagged for him . Served it 's purpose though . Again ... it does look like a sex toy .	1
Bought for a lab mix we adopted who is a year old & # 34 ; puppy & # 34 ; who was chewing on everything and everybody including our poor 12 yr old Westie . Satisfies his need to chew and would recommend for anyone who is at wits end a bigger & # 34 ; bone & # 34 ; for their dog to chew on . Even our Westie gives it a try every now and then .	1
This is good for strong chewers . It seems a little heavy to me , heavier than it needs to be . But unlike something my dog can destroy or something like a filled bone , the Galileo seems to hold little attention for my lab .	1
Though this is not my dog 's favorite chew , I am still giving it a 5-star rating because it is quite solid and has held up to her chewing over the past 4 months . Those of you living in apartments with hardwood floors should be aware that if the dog drops this toy , it will make a very loud 'thud ' noise on the floor , which may anger those living below you . Though my dog does not turn to this toy first , I have seen pictures of this toy after 12 months of abuse from `` power-chewers '' and was amazed at how well these toys held up to powerful pit bull jaws , which is why I am giving this 5 stars . My dog prefers longer and thinner chew-toys , which might be why this is not the first toy she picks , however , she does not ignore it and it does get a fair amount of use . I would not purchase again , as this is not one of her favorites , but I do encourage people to try it out with their dogs .	1
Our Bulldogs LOVE this toy and so do we . First the shape is a great design it 's full of all sorts of curves and areas where your pooch can get a good hold and settle down to a long chew-fest . Easy to carry around even the goliath sized Souper presents no mobility problem for our 10 month old puppy.Our oldest a 95 pound 6 year old Old English Bull dog was practically weaned on this toy and he adores them . I ca n't even begin ti count how many we 've been through which should give you a good idea of how much our dogs love these . The material is n't the newer extra tough Nylabone - but it 's tough enough to hold up to Harley 's massive jaw strength and relentless , no merct chewing fests.Like all Nylabones we discard them when the ends fray . This is one of their best toys and an all time favorite .	1
I have a yellow lab puppy who loooves to chew . He has , to this point , not been able to destruct this bone ! ! He and his older dog friends all love it . It is mad of a very good material , is a great shape , and a wonderful toy .	1
Our lab carries around sticks , rocks , you name it wherever she goes . This particular style of Nylabone is exceptional because of the design . There are two ridges that fit their incisors perfectly so they can carry it around without worrying it will slip out and break my foot if she drops it ! ~ Also , even though not flavored , she likes to work on it slowly , which means for the money it will last a long time . We 've spent a lot on the other types of designs and she liked them but they were either to destructible or too heavy for her to walk around with for any amount of time . For whatever reason , it seems to calm her to carry a bone around and this is the best designed , tough and perfect size for a large dog . She says THANK YOU : )	1
I have two Rhodesian Ridgeback puppies ( 5mo & 10mo ) and they LOVE the Galileo Bone in the `` Souper '' size . They grab it with their two front paws and will knaw on it for a half hour straight . It seems like it will last for a long time and the more they chew it , the more they enjoy it . It does n't make a mess when they 're chewing , the ends fray into something like tooth brush scrubbers , but do n't break off . I do n't think the 5mo old would enjoy it as much if the 10mo old had n't already started chewing it to create these scrubbers . It 's probably best for dogs that have their adult teeth grown in . It would be too tough for the little one to knaw into a brand new one . I 'm ordering a second one so they do n't have to share it anymore ! : )	1
My little boxer-pit bull mix has chewed through every `` durable '' toy there is . I got her the `` wolf '' size Galileo and had to help her start it ( it 's slippery before they scratch it up ) but now she loves it . If you have a dog that can chew the other durable Nylabone products down to a nub then this is for you ! It does n't even seem to matter that it 's not flavored ( at least not to my knowledge ) . I would also recommend the Nylabone Double Action Chew - this one has also lasted far longer then the Nylabone durable regular bones .	1
My pitbull LOVES these Nylabones . She goes through the smaller ones in a matter of days ; but this one is large enough to keep her busy for months . I highly recommend	1
This chew toy has lasted thru several strong German Shepherds . The original lasted nearly 5 years . No noticeable pieces of the toy seem to be laying around the house or in the dogs stools . It really is a tough toy and although it 's probably made in China ( products that I detest ) , I 've seen no adverse reactions to the dogs using it . It is a bit heavy for the small German shepherd female that we have , our 125 # boy plays with it like tossing popcorn . I 'll definitely purchase another when this one wears out !	1
This truly is a super strong bone . Our pointer mix loves to chew , but far from mega chewer . This satisfies here and it only flakes off in very very tiny flakes that easily pass through our dog . Awesome product .	1
I have a very hard chewer and Nylabone is the only bones he gets , he manages to shave off very small pieces but nothing of significance , whatever he swallows go 's right through him . They are more expensive than other bones but well worth it .	1
My dog is a chewer . When I says that he can destroy a nylabone in 2 weeks , I mean it . I bought this for him for Christmas . It is now may and my dog is still working on it . Best bone I 've found for heavy chewers ! !	1
I found out about this item while visiting my son , his dog has one and my puppy would not leave it alone .	1
In 1994 One of my heavy-chewing Samoyed dogs had a deadly episode with a Nylabone toy . When I made the President of the Nylabone company aware of the problem with his product , he was extremely cooperative . He not only undertook settling all the medical expenses but a couple of months later sent my dog a Galileo Souper with an attached note that read : `` Our team of engineers have come up with Galileo , the toughest dogbone around , created just for hard chewers like Rajah . This is the first bone off the production belt for him . I hope he is well now and will enjoy Galileo . `` `` Silver Frost Rajah '' has since passed away of old age , but his offsprings and currently his grand-puppies are enjoying it . And , except for some teeth-scrapes , the Galileo is STILL intact !	1
Wellness makes such great products and I have been feeding this canned food with Core Weight Management dry food and my senior dogs love it and it is so good for them .	1
My 9 year old boston terrier has eaten this along with the dry version for several years . She loves it .	1
I use this as the primary food for my elderly Yorkie and to make & # 34 ; gravy & # 34 ; in my bigger dogs ' food . All of them absolutely love it and the Yorkie remains very healthy and youthful at 16 years .	1
Wellness Senior is palatable and consistent in its formulation , unlike some other brands , whose formulation can vary widely from batch to batch . The protein level is exactly what my senior dogs , and all senior dogs , should have . I 'm happy that this product is available among the myriad of choices on the market nowadays . There are n't a lot of senior canned diets available .	1
Another good product from Wellness . We mix Wellness Core and Wellness senior formula for our 9 year old little guy . Have tried many different holistic dog food brands , Wellness is still the best in terms of price , quality , taste , ingredients and even the appearance of packaging . Have recommended Wellness to many friends with dogs , they all find the products satisfactory . The only other brand can rival Wellness is Orijen , which is also a great dog food but they only offer dry ones .	1
I love , love , love Wellness products and I 'm happy to get this at a great price plus free shipping right to my door - saves me a trip to the pet store . The product arrived in great shape .	1
It looks and smells good , and it has the right consistency . My dogs love it and it agrees with them .	1
I recently ordered three different Wellness Canned Cat Food varieties . I ordered the chicken , beef and chicken , and turkey . My cats LOVED all three and could n't get enough of the food . I found the consistency to be perfect as well with the perfect amount of moisture or broth that my cats love . I did not have any problems with damaged cans that some users noted . I am ordering another case of all three flavors and I will keep this review updated if I come across this problem in future orders . Overall , highly recommended !	1
We have two large cats . Wellness has been their saving grace . This is great cat food for those looking for quality food for their feline family members .	1
This is another Wellness formula that my cat really likes . My local pet shop does n't always carry it , so it was great to see it here and have free Prime shipping . Plus , the price was a few cents a can lower than my local pet shop .	1
I bought this for my kitten ( now a cat ) and he loves it . It does have a sligthly different , runnier texture than before , but my cat could care less .	1
A bit spendy but this grain free diet has improved my cat 's GI issues immensely . In mixing it up , it definitely does n't have the bone and other byproduct chunks of cheaper products .	1
I feed my elderly cat Wellness canned and dry . She only gets the beef and chicken or just chicken canned food . Fish flavors are out of the question with her seizure disorder . Her last vet checkup went very well , even with her kidney issues . I would recommend Wellness to anybody looking for a better cat food option . Does n't do well with cats that have digestive problems . My younger cat ca n't eat Wellness without getting foul gas and diarrhea .	1
My two senior cats & # 34 ; lick their bowl clean & # 34 ; with this food unlike other premium canned cat foods . I 've also noticed my cat with hyperthyroidism gaining back some of his weight loss . They will eat it cold since I refrigerate the unused portion . I highly recommend this cat food especially in this economically-priced size .	1
With six feline companions , these larger cans offer the economy that allows us to afford the best , grain free foods for our family . This is just one of the varieties offered in 12.5 ounce cans of pure goodness .	1
I adopted a cat from the local shelter two months ago , and when I got him home , he had extreme diarrhea . I tried Imodium , but that did n't help , so I went on the Internet to see what I could learn . I found out many cats are allergic to grains because they have never been part of a cat 's normal diet . Cats are carnivores . However , commercial pet food companies load their pet foods with grains , especially corn because it 's cheap , and it is n't digestible for cats . I also learned about everything else in commercial pet foods , including euthanized pets ! ! How disgusting ! I researched grain-free cat foods and learned of the Wellness brand of grain-free pet foods , and ordered a case of canned food . The results were almost immediate ! After just a couple of days on the Wellness canned food , my cake no longer has diarrhea and it has never reoccurred . On top of that , he loves the Wellness food , so I highly recommend this food for all cat owners . If you research the ingredients of commercial cat ( or dog ) foods , and you love your pets , you will never feed them commercial foods again . Wellness is the way to go !	1
Still a work in progress , I 've been trying to experiment with different brands and flavors of grain free cat food . The Vet believes that there may be some obscure ingredient contained in some foods that makes my cat sometimes regurgitate the food quickly after she consumes it . I 've found that she can usually tolerate this one better than most . However , the quest is still in progress , since she occasionally has issues with this one as well.Although she seems to like this flavor all right , I 'm docking a star off the rating because it is sort of a pasty pate . In addition , I 've found it to have an obvious amount of whitish grease in it ( especially when it is cold ) , requiring that I heat it briefly in the microwave -- otherwise she will regurgitate it for sure .	1
My cats love this food and buying the large cans is a much better value than going with individual sizes .	1
We just adopted our two year old cat and have been testing out different wet and dry foods . I got Wellness Salmon and Wellness Beef and Chicken and the Beef and Chicken was the winner . We judged this based on the following : Cole ate the Beef and Chicken in about 20 seconds and licked the bowl clean . Has n't happened with any other food ! We also recommend the Wellness dry food . This cat food is expensive though compared to others but if I do n't eat crappy processed food why expect my cat to ?	1
I love Wellness brand pet foods and treats . My cat was pretty picky and getting sick on other brands of food . I was glad to see that this cat food is free of artificial ingredients , as well as grain-free . She gets fed a bit of this canned food , combined with a small amount of Wellness dry cat food , daily . She was overweight before starting this food and now looks to be a healthy , normal weight . I would definitely recommend this food to other cat owners !	1
Over the past 2 weeks I 've been transitioning my 10 month old cat from dry to wet food . This is the only wet food that he really eats with enthusiasm . I really think it helped in the transition . We 've also tried Wellness Core and EVO ( also high quality foods ) but he likes this stuff the best .	1
one of the healthiest brands on the market . the ingredients are excellent and wholesome . My cat is 20 yrs old on this stuff ! ! no fillers , no crap , nothing like & # 34 ; pork lips & # 34 ; and gunk like that	1
I believe in good pet food . Have used wellness for years for both dogs and cats . My cat likes beef but not seafood . Go figure . This is her fav .	1
What , you say ? A finicky cat ? How unusual ! Right . But as they are finicky , it also means that what one cat likes or dislikes may be entirely subjective and not true for another cat . Damn animals ! Got ta love 'em . Anyway , as I said , it is a high quality food , and not as expensive as the ones my cats will eat , of course . ( Especially in the big cans . ) It is not grain-free , though . And remember that fish types are cheaper to make , but are n't so healthy for your cat . This is also the pate form , which , of course , my cats do n't seem to care for . They like the gravy stuff , thank you very much . So you might want to try this . But I suggest going to a store and just buying a few cans , and some different flavors , for the picky little things to try first . Definitely not a whole case , like you-know-who did .	1
I have two cats over 10 years old and they have sensitivities to lots of canned cat food . This brand stays down and they have n't gotten tired of it like they did with so many others . I 've been using it for about 6 months .	1
We purchased this dental Kong version as an alternative to our dog 's regular Kong toy . We stuff either this or one of the other Kong 's for him each day and give it to him when we leave for work . The large size is perfect for our 60 lb . American bulldog/lab mix . He will get it to play with and chew at other times of the day . So far , after two months , it has n't worn out or fallen apart . He seems to enjoy it just as much as his regular Kongs . It favorably compares to other Kong products and it 's a good value for the price .	1
Have two of these and although the boys play with them they prefer others . It is difficult putting a treat in them or it is too easy . Either way the boys get bored to easily	1
So far this one was one of the best toys I have purchased so far . I have a pitbull that chews through every toy I have gotton him . This one is going on 2 months when he normally distroys a toy with in 2 hours to 2 days .	1
I love the kong products . We have agressive chewers and these are the only thing they have not destroyed . Plus the price is very reasonable considering what local stores sell them for .	1
Amazon has the best prices on these , some about 1/3 of Petsmart price for same product.we have 2 yellow labs and they love it , younger 1.5 year old pup chews on it all the time . Great .	1
Good priceThese kong products do not breakI have three medium size dogsThey enjoy playing with them.Good buy	1
So far so good . Our 5 mos old lab 'destroyed ' the Kong Genius-line toys ( in less than 1 hour ) . This toy has lasted a week so far . I would recommend it .	1
I bought this for my one year old husky . It definitely stands up I the wear and tear , like any long , but be careful as it has two very large openings so food or kong filling does not stay contained inside . It leaked out and got on the rug !	1
Our dog has had this toy for a couple of weeks . He 's pretty tough on toys , but this one is holding up great . And , he loved it from day one . Great product ! ! !	1
My 7mo Lab has n't destroyed it..he gets a little bored with it tho..but all the kongs we have.have outlasted all the other toys..good product for my power chewer .	1
my dog enjoys this toy and loves pulling out the treat in the middle , it 's not quite as much fun without it , but still good	1
My APBT loves the Kong chew toys . This one is great for helping to clean her teeth . And it has held up for quite awhile now	1
Costco 's Kirkland Dog Biscuits fit perfectly ( tight enough to stay in ) in this toy , and is n't easy for my pup to get it out . She 's a labrador . She works it for a while before she starts slamming it to the ground , thus breaking the biscuit up and allowing small pieces to come out at a time . I can see it working even better with a smaller dog maybe , although it is quite a large Kong toy . My dog does n't have separation anxiety when I leave for work anymore , because she knows she 's going to get her Kong with a treat inside every time I leave .	1
This is a good product . Durable . I was n't able to find a suitable snack for it yet to have it fit perfectly , but my dog still likes to chase it and chew on it , and so far this is the only toy that was n't destroyed in 1 day .	1
Have mastiff & this is one of the few toys that can survive his jaws . Very durable & long lasting .	1
Great chewing toy . Great quality and after 3 weeks of playing with it my dog did n't even scratch the rubber .	1
Love Kong products . They really stand up against the teeth of 3 Labradoodles . Having said that , 2 of them have n't gotten much use from it as the smallest , Scarlett , took it outside and hid it ... as she does with all of her favorite toys . I 'm assuming that they are still playing with it ... just do n't get outside that often to see them do it . : - )	1
My dog does n't like plastic toys ... Even filled with peanut butter , this Kong did n't interest him for very long , and I 'm considering trying a different Kong.It looks like this would be fantastic for dogs who like to chew , though !	1
Our 11 month old male English bull terrier loves this toy , and our female of the same breed loves to play with the toy and chase with the toy . The toy is very rugged , yet soft enough to interest them . So far neither of them have chewed any pieces off of this toy . We have used the tougher black rubber Kong bell shaped toys also . These red rubber ones are a bit softer and easier for them to play with if you can keep them from destroying the red rubber toys . So far so good with ours .	1
My rott loves these things , and has yet to completely destroy the xl ones . She gets the ridges all ripped up and the ends chewed down - but they last her a couple/few months before i replace them .	1
My shepherd likes this toy , but it is not his favorite . He will chew on it occasionally.He has not torn it up as he does the others . Good quality though	1
Just what we wanted . Our dog has had the toy for almost a month and no damage . She can destroy most toys within hours.Kong is great for the chewers in our lives . She now has 3 , but one is put up for Christmas .	1
i fill it with peanut butter , kibble , bits of hotdog , or whatever dog safe food i have lying around10 month old Black lab puppy at around 65 lbs can chew on it all day and not damage the rubber	1
Both my dogs loved both as a throw toy and a chew toy . Great for hiding treats for more entrainment . Proved to be indestructible . Red color easy to find in the yard .	1
This product is great my pet really enjoys it and it a great way for him to get exercise . It does n't seem to get damamged being outside or with him chewing on it all the time .	1
loves it when other favorite toys not available . Great with putting goodies inside , keeps busy for a long time , Loves it this way	1
Kitty started having accidents - in my closet , on my bed , on a couch , etc . There is nothing more offensive than the scent of cat urine . I was desperate and very upset . After ruling out a physical problem I started researching the causes of inappropriate soiling . Cats are very clean animals and sometimes either their litter boxes are not kept clean enough or they do n't like their kitty litter . I decided that I would switch litter as my first line of defense . I read that World 's Best has a soft texture that some cats like . Also , since it is clumping and scoopable , kitty might appreciate not having to walk in wet litter . Well , it worked . It has been almost a month and no more accidents . I scoop out the clumps at least once and sometimes twice a day as well as all solid waste . This litter is not great in the odor control department but frequent scooping helps and I think that all the litter must be switched out at least every 2-3 weeks or else the litter box starts to smell unpleasant . I have not had a problem with bugs or other little nasties . Otherwise , I will have to discontinue using this product and I certainly do n't want to have to do that .	1
I work for a veterinary hospital , and after the big food scare I found myself calling around to different food companies to see who made an AMERICAN product . And by American , I did n't mean imported products thrown into a food assembled in the United States so it could be called `` made here . '' I wanted meat grown here , veggies grown here , and no imports . FOUND IT.This dog food was recommended to me by a bloodhound breeder . Bloodhounds are known to have gunky skin ( must be all the wrinkles ) and they are prone to eye infections , allergies , bloat , and numerous other conditions . Well , most bloodhounds . Not her dogs . Her dogs have healthy glowing coats , shiney eyes , and just bring her lots of ribbons in the show ring.My dogs are couch potatoes , but I feel better feeding them something good for them . At first I was worried the smaller bite size might interfere with good tartar control , but now months on this food NO TARTAR . At all , and my one dog had had a tartar control problem for a long time . His doggy breath has never been better . If I could give this food 10 stars , I would . I 'd recommend this food for toy breeds as well as giant breeds.It used to be when I opened a bag of food I 'd keep my nose away because the dog food was stinky . Not this food , now , I 'm not saying I want a mouthful , but it is NOT stinky like some dog foods . You can actually smell the herbs they use.This product is on my wish list at Amazon . Anyone who wants to get me a good gift , get me a bag . It is definately a gift I 'll use !	1
switched from solid gold to merrick wilderness when solid gold was sold . dogs had terrible gas on merrick ( most likely from the unnecessary fruits ) . switched to canidae and all is well . ordered from amazon . free shipping . was about $ 25 cheaper than getting it from my local store .	1
My pup , now an adult dog of 11 pounds wo n't eat anything else . I am a dog lover and owner for over 50 years and I know how to slowly switch from one food to another . WELL ... . forget that . We were doing fine until about 2 months when the food became a little more than 1/2 of the & # 34 ; new & # 34 ; food . That 's when the pooch sat his self down stared at the bowl and then at me and ... .. kept sitting . He refused to eat in the am and only ate 1/2 his evening meal out of shear hunger . This went on for 3 days . So , I dumped out the & # 34 ; Mixture & # 34 ; and replaced it with nothing but this Canidae dry dog food topped with a dollop of plain yogurt ( yes he 's absolutely spoiled - great for digestion ) and he stood , cocked his head and promptly ate his breakfast.I could n't believe , still ca n't , that Amazon actually carried this Canidae food . It is the best price I have found and obviously will be continuing to purchase it here .	1
I 've tried different foods with my puppies . This is the only brand that they actually seem to enjoy . i 've tried science hills diet , purina puppy chow , and Iams . Finally , I decided that I needed to find something that did n't have all sorts of fillers in it . So I decided to try Canidae . Not only do I know that they will eat it right away but it produces a lot less poop . With all the other kinds of food we would see it just sit there for hours and hours . Plus , Purina gave them the stinkiest , biggest , most icky poop . With this , their poop have gotten a lot smaller and they do not need to go as much.I had seen some stuff online though at first stating that it caused their dogs to be sick and I was worried about feeding them it the first time . However , I 've had no problems so I think it was just a bad batch not too long ago . They are both doing great and I think this is the best filler-less food for the price .	1
have had a difficult time finding this product an have gone ahead an gotten 50 lbs to see me through the next 6 months , if you cant find it when you need it the next best thing is to stock up when you do . it s a great litter , smells great absorbs great , cat seem to like it better then the CLUMPING kind , comes recomended .	1
This is THE best cat litter I 've ever used ; No odor . Better than clumping types . Lasts and lasts . And it 's lightweight . At first , I mixed it with old litter , but the cats did n't seem to care . They took to Cedarific immediately . When I could n't find it again locally , I panicked till I found it on Amazon and will always order online ... large bags , free s/h to my door . Hint : Buy two bags . This product works .	1
Luckily I have a cat that seems very tolerable when it comes to me switching litters . I 've been through a half dozen or so varieties in the five years I 've had him and while I 've yet to find the `` purrfect '' litter , this one is pretty good except for the tracking.So prior to this brand , I was usingKitty 's Crumble All Natural Coconut Husk Cat Litter , 14 lb , which worked really well , until Amazon decided to jack the price up and make it unaffordable . This litter had good reviews and , as of this review , is roughly the same price as Kitty 's Crumble used to be here , so I decided to try this out.The 15 pound bag has a nice plastic handle to it and a zip tear opening . The 20 pound bag does n't have a handle , nor a zip tear opening . Inside is just cedar , ground up into very light and circular amounts . It 's like pouring out a bag of sand , only it 's cedar . It has a nice smell to it , is extremely soft and I do n't notice any odor . When Garfunkel urinates in it , it does n't clump and that section turns into a darker , maroon-type color until it dries up . Since he tends to go all the way in the back of the box in the same spot , by the end of the week I notice slight amounts of liquid residue at the bottom of the litter box when I 'm emptying it , but even then , all the litter above it has returned to its normal `` dry '' color and is n't maroon like it was just used.I have a big litter box and just like with the Kitty 's Crumble I use half a bag of this each week , scooping out the poo daily and dumping it all and using another half of the bag from scratch . Works well.The only real problem , as the review title says , is that this tracks like crazy . I live in a studio apartment and within a day you can see the cedar all over my carpet and kitchen linoleum . Also , if I 'm in bed and Garfunkel is doing his business , after he rockets out of the box and jumps onto the bed with me the litter gets all over the sheets . He does have fur tufts on his feet though , so they tend to get trapped in there.This litter would probably be perfect if it did n't track so much . Otherwise , this is a winner .	1
I have four cats ( yes , I have lost my mind ) and when the youngest two joined the family , I wanted to try and get them used to something a little friendlier than the heavy clumping costly typical super market purchased litter . I found this , use it in 2 standard boxes side by side , and I just love it . On the *worst* day , the room where the boxes are smells like cedar chips : ) Generally , it smells like nothing at all . I have a bad back , too , and really appreciate front door delivery and how light the chips are . My youngest two cats favor these boxes , and one of the older ones uses it too . I have noticed ( sorry if this is TMI ) that they urinate , not defecate , in the cedar boxes and use the traditional box and litter for the other ... not complaining ! One difference is that you end up pretty much changing out the litter completely when you deal with the box- for me , every 2 to 3 days . The chips are light , so kitties may kick them out of the box but they vacuum up , no problem . This thing has lasted me for a few months , and I am a convert ... if I could only get the other cats into it I would be the happiest cat guardian ever : ) Highly recommended .	1
The cats seem to like this . It smells good , and seems to hide the litterbox odor pretty well . One of my cats that had bee peeing on the floor is now peeing in the box . The litter very lightweight and a couple of times the smaller litter boxes have been tipped over . That never happened with the heavy litter . That 's my only complaint , and that 's the reason for only four stars . I do plan to replace the smaller boxes with larger boxes so they do n't tip over .	1
You do n't get too much more cost-effective than this cedar litter . I 've been using it for four weeks now and I have n't used up more than half the bag . It smells terrific , it 's soft , and the cats seem to like it . But it does have a couple of drawbacks . First it 's very light which means it gets tracked everywhere . I 'm finding it all the way across the house on their cat tree.And then , it 's red . It 's not blood red , and the color does tend to fade after some use , but at first sight it 's a little unnerving . You would n't like to look in your litter box and see brownish red , would you ? No , you would n't . It also takes a bit longer to absorb liquids than I 'd like , and I have to spend quite a bit of time turning the litter over to spread the liquid waste around.Odor control is very , very good , and the smell of cedar is lovely . I 've used it in hamster cages and have never minded the scent.It 's definitely in the running for a permanent place in the house , but more research is necessary before I make a decision .	1
Great litter ! absorbs odors really well without having a strong scent of its own . It is good for the animals and environmentally friendly Only downside is that if you ca n't get it locally it is expensive	1
What a deal . The stray cats are eating it all up and looking sassy . Must be sustaining cat food . The price is incredible ! Again , thanks to Amazon for helping me feed stray cats .	1
Great donation item for the animal rescue . Per pound price is affordable and ingredients are better than some of the other cheap brands .	1
This was a gift to a feline sanctuary which was gratefully received . As far as I know , the cats liked it .	1
I bought this as a gift for a family members dog . Perfect size for their yorkie . The dog loved it .	1
I have a crazy-mad chewer at home , and an occasional chewer too . Upon arrival , I quickly unwrapped the toy and looked at it . It is covered in little bumps that look very easy to chew off , so I was a little skeptical on how this would hold up , but I like it because it cleans their teeth . I gave it to the occasional chewer , and she sniffed it before slowly grabbing it , chewed a little while , and left it alone . She has n't chewed on it much since . The crazy-mad chewer likes it , but not as much as the other bone . He was chewing it one night and from the sound I thought it would be gone in the morning , but no , it is still holding up pretty well . A few of the bumps have come off , and some are stretched , but overall it is doing well for my dogs ... and protecting things I do n't want them to chew on .	1
I tried few different Nylabone chew toys , but this was the only one he would enjoy chewing.this is flexible and soft ( not too soft ) , and has small bumps all over it and that makes it fun to chew on.Highly recommended .	1
Good toy . Weiner dog sometimes gets little pieces off . Not as hard as the standard off white nylabones . Dog still loves it .	1
Much to my surprise , my small poodle loves this thing . She normally only cares for flavored chews so the fact that she likes this bone says a lot . I constantly expected her to chew pieces off of it , but it has lasted well over a year of occasional chewing.I can see larger dogs or those with strong jaws to chew pieces of this off , so base purchasing this off what you know of your dogs with previous treats . For smaller dogs , however , this is highly recommended .	1
We bought these for my small poms . they love it , and it keeps them entertained . they chew moderately and this has still held up . love nylabone products .	1
This is my puppy favorite chew toy . Good quality product , , not some piece of junk . She loves it brings it to bed .	1
This is my puppies favorite chew toy by far , he loves the nubs on the toy and will sit and chew for hours .	1
This used to be one of our dogs favorite toys . They used to fight over who could chew it . I think this is a good toy to add to the house .	1
This is one of several Nylabone chews that I got for my two Pom Pups . They are great for puppies who are teething .	1
My dog really likes the Nylabone ( Blue ) Dental Chew . I 've never experienced a problem with her use of it in all the years I 've been getting it for her . The nubs on the surface of this chew toy massage the gums and the salivation promoted by it helps clean the teeth.As with all dog chew toys , you should periodically check to see how your dog is doing with it . Any chew toy fragment swallowed ( no matter what type of chew it may be ) can suddenly become stuck in the throat or intestinal tract . ( I did not give it 5 stars because it 's not made from a natural material . ) However , I am very disappointed in the price tag from Amazon : as of this review , the regular size ( 4-1/2 '' ) is sold for $ 5.49 , but you can get it through Drs . Foster & Smith Pet Supplies for $ 2.99 -- I discovered this AFTER I 'd placed my Amazon order . Amazon and its merchants know they can sell it for less and should be competitive with their prices .	1
She 's had it for weeks and it 's holding up really well . Some of the tiny blue nubs do come off as she chews which is the only reason I did n't give it 5-stars .	1
I loved them and gave it 5 stars but if my dog needed to rate this he would give it out of all the ones a 20 stars . the blue ones are the ones he keeps at . if I dont have them waiting in the closet I do not know what I would do . He is a chewer .	1
My puppy loves to chew on this bone and it says it will help with cleaning her teeth , but you have to be careful because she has chewed off some of the bristles and she is tiny , so I do n't want her to swallow them . This is definitely not for strong chewers . My puppy is teething , but once she is out of the teething stage , I will probably put this toy away so she does not eat any of it .	1
I like this Nylabone is softer and the dogs seem to enjoy the texture . I usually replace it every 6 months or so .	1
This keeps our French Bulldog puppy occupied and he likes to chew on it . He usually will only chew it when we hold it though .	1
My puppy loves anything chewable , and prefers textured items . These are a hit , and big enough to last her for a few months ( if she does n't beat it up too much- so far , so good ) .	1
Beware : Five pound yorkie was able to nibble away at a corner in about five minutes . Wish it was a bit stronger .	1
My Golden Retriever loves this particular Nylabone . We own about 30 nylabones , but this one is one of the most popular . My dog always digs through the toy box to find this toy ! It has a significant texture to it , so I was n't sure about it when I first purchased it because I thought the textured plastic would be easy to chew pieces off of . Luckily that was n't the case and it is still being played with serveral months after I purchased it .	1
My little chihuahua loves this bone more than any other . She chews and chews until it gets down to about one inch , at which time I throw it away and get a new one !	1
My two little dogs love chewing this very hard chew toy . It does n't smell weird or break apart too easily .	1
Our latest addition to our family is a chewer , so this gift will get its wear with Cooper , he loves to play with all by himself	1
I have 4 little yorkies and they are really enjoying these chews . They are great for their teeth , gums and jaws - and they keep them occupied for a long time .	1
My morkie LOVES this chew toy . He has two of these , and I do not regret purchasing them . This chew toy is the perfect size for toy and small breeds . Very easy to wash as well .	1
My dog loves the dental chew ! It keeps him busy while I am at work , which is a huge plus . He was tearing up the carpet before I got him this .	1
My dogs are usually super picky about what they chew on ( other than tearing apart stuffed toys ) . Usually it has to be something tasty as well as chewy , but my dogs have taken to this chew toy quite well . Love that it cleans their teeth too !	1
My two Yorkies LOVE these chews ! One loves it more than the other , but both have to have identical chew bones .	1
My one boy who loves to chew loves these . I keep several laying around . One in his crate keeps him from destroying his bed .	1
I hesitantly ordered this product , our first & # 34 ; fake & # 34 ; bone . It was well received , both our Russell and German Jagd Terriers enjoy it daily . The little nobbies do get chewed off and I assume ingested , but no ill effects . I will buy this again when worn out .	1
The dogs love this chew . However , it is not good for tug games ( my puppy loves tug ) because the little nubs that are good for their teeth are not good for my hands . : )	1
Our Rescue loves all Nylabone products . All our dogs comming into rescue get a couple for their play & enjoyment & when they are adopted they bring their Nylabones with them . All of our New adoptive families are strongly urged to only buy Nylabones for their nee family members .	1
Our French Bulldog , Dweezil , is very tough on chew toys but this one has held up and is still in very good condition !	1
This chew toy is perfect for our dog . He 's a pretty intense chewer and he loves to carry this toy around with him .	1
The only chew toy that has endured the endless chewing of my dog . He absolutely loves this thing and I love it because it 's safe and non-toxic .	1
I only bought one of these to try out between my two Chi 's and pugweenie . That was a mistake because they fight over it and steal it from one another . I will soon be buying 3 more of these so each of them can have one . I believe that they prefer it over their other chewies because of the little nubbins on it seem to help sore gums , not to mention their teeth are nice and white .	1
of all the puppy products we bought , this one took the cake . She plays with it for a while and is not intimidated ( its small , but super durable ) .I recommend it for the younger pups 4-8 lbs and under 4-6 months ( maybe longer ! )	1
We have a doggie Day Car/overnight business and we really only buy Nylabone products for chewing . The dogs love them and this one is not a hard material so the little dogs who are still getting their new teeth in love it .	1
This is the only `` hard '' synthetic chewy my dog is really interested in . It is slightly pliable rubbery material - but he 's had others with a similar feel that he would n't chew as long as this . Not sure if it 's the nubby texture ? I bought this size hoping he could hold in his paws , but it 's still a little short ( he 's a 20 pound dog ) . We end up holding one end while he chews - with his eyes closed and an expression of pure joy . He works pretty hard at it for 10 minutes or so .	1
Does n't last as long as the teething chew I bought but the dogs love chewing on them , keeps teeth clean , just watch for the pieces that break off .	1
This was a great chew for my Boston until she turned 6 mos . Then she started chewing the nubs off and eating them . If you have a heavy chewer get hard plastic chew toys .	1
If you 're looking for a good litter to use with kittens , Swheat Scoop is hard to beat . Unlike clumping clay litters , this is safe to use with kittens . Yes , there are other clumping litters out there that are also safe for use with kittens , but Swheat Scoop seems to be the least expensive . I was impressed with how very , very little dust this litter contains . It 's unscented , which I suppose is really a matter of personal preference , but a major plus for those with sensitive noses . The downside : it does n't clump quite as tightly as clumping clay litters , but when you 've got kittens , it 's better than no clumping at all ! And yes , it also does track more than clay litters . As for forming hard-to-remove globs on the sides and bottoms of the box , I scoop our box daily ( we have 4 three-month-old kittens ) and have n't experienced any such problems . Maybe it 's because I clean the litterbox so often , maybe it 's because a kitten 's tiny bladder ca n't possibly hold that much fluid , but whatever the reason , scooping daily with 4 kittens , I have n't had to chisel any hardened globs from the sides or bottom of the box .	1
I have 2 spayed , female cats . Neither are vigorous diggers , there are two large litter pans side by side . Neither cat is fussy about litter type.Pluses : -- flushable ( my top reason for use , I do n't have trash service ) -- acceptable clumping ( but I have never used the clay litters to compare ) -- non toxic & no lung choking perfumes ( I am bothered by potent odors ) Minuses : -- cost -- to eliminate odor you must add an additional product -- for best results you have to clean box daily -- cost ( it 's a byproduct of wheat production that is likely swept up off a factory floor somewhere , wrapped in a fancy brand name and sold at TOP DOLLAR ) Notes & Suggestions : -- I have found that the urine sinks to the bottom and sticks there . If I tip the box so the dry litter is out of the way , then I can scoop out just the clumped litter and any granules that break off . This helps to reduce odor. -- Every time after I scoop the box , I sprinkle baking soda over the top . I find that it sticks to the pee soaked clumps , so it must be replenished. -- I do n't put new litter in every time ... instead I let the level get lower and lower . Then at the end of the week , I completely dispose of everything in the box , wash the box with diluted bleach and soap , refill with fresh litter. -- Without baking soda , this stuff does small like warm bread that 's been peed on ... I ca n't imagine what the corn based stuff must smell like ? ! I have smelled corn based products ( cat food , corn gluten fertilizer , chicken food & chicken poop which smells identical BTW , etc.. ) and they are revolting to me . Personal preference. -- I pour my bags right into a galvanized , sealed can . I have not had any problems with insects . Although I can imagine that it would easily be an issue if it is not kept in a sealed container. -- I did find evidence of a mouse getting into the litter box . I dealt with him , and do not have any mouse issues in my house . If you already battle with these creatures , it could be a concern. -- If I leave the box more than two days without cleaning , I do experience the gooey state of clumping . This litter was a COMPLETE bust at my sister 's house . She has 4 cats , 2 boxes and does n't like to clean on a daily basis.POSSIBLE CHEAPER ALTERNATIVE : -- Today , when I picked up a new bag , and was griping about the cost and how cheap I am , the clerk at the feed store mentioned a cheaper alternative . Apparently they have a customer that buys chicken food , and uses that in her boxes . It 's a grain based crumble that effectively works the same . The most compelling part being that 50 # costs about $ 16.00 , give or take . I got home , looked it up online and there are threads about how it works . I think I 'll try that out next time.UPDATE , 3/21/2013 : I tried the chicken food . It works the same . Zero difference in effectiveness and odor . Have found granules of `` litter '' that were in the cracks of the hardwood that were moth eaten ... like those moths that get into flour . Chicken food is loads cheaper ! I have more cats now , and other options besides flushing for disposal . I have switched litter completely . With the number of boxes that I now require , the insect and rodent draw is too much . Two boxes was fine , but with more it 's like a buffet for pests , even with diligent cleaning .	1
I loved Swheat , but thought I 'd check out the more-expensive alternative : World 's Best corn litter.Both are a natural resource that supports our farmers.The wheat actually forms clumps that are as hard as rocks.World 's Best Corn Litter had slightly softer clumps.The wheat had an inert smell when new ... .but also never did start to smell for the 4 weeks it was in my two-cat 's box.World 's Best Corn Litter has a yucky sour corn smell when new ... .and after just 3 days ... it began to stink in the litter box . And yes , I 'm at home all day so I scoop twice a day , sometimes more . Imagine how it would smell if it was n't scooped very often , like so many cat owners do.Swheat was $ 8.99 for a big box at Walmart.World best Corn Litter was $ 20 for a comparable sizeSwheat wins ! You may have just realized that World 's Best ( corn grain ) litter is superior to clay and other litters ... .and it is . But Swheat ( wheat grain ) litter is superior to corn , if not just for the smell alone ! Both right out of the box , AND after it 's been pee 'd in a few days .	1
One of my 4 dogs is horrible finicky when it comes to food . She does not mind this one ( I still have to mix it up with some wet food though ) . Many of other brands she will not eat , even when I mix them up with wet food . I give it 4 stars only because I know it 's not the best food out there . But I have to buy what works for my dogs .	1
I spent several decades slinging around large bags of as many as three age-specific formulations at a time , depending on the makeup of my family . I ca n't do that anymore and I was happy to find the & # 34 ; all life stages & # 34 ; formulation , guess we 've come full circle from when I was young and all dogs of whatever age ate the same thing . Anyway , the bottom line was would they eat it . Resounding yes ! Rip , the old boy , bolted his down ( one of the reasons I like small nuggets ) and then was snacking out of the bag until I closed it , at which point he lay down right by the bag . That was a couple of bags ago and they continue to eat it happily . No digestive difficulties that I 'm aware of and I do keep up with stuff like that .	1
My sheltie- collie , huskey mix dog was having problems with her digestion . She is old and needed a milder on the intestine product to eat . Purino Pro Plan with chicken and rice is perfect for her . She loves the taste . Her problems cleared up in less than one week and she seems to have more energy.Purina Pro dog food works great for her in every way .	1
One of my dogs was chewing her feet and making them raw , my vet suggested I try this food for her . She is doing much better , she stills chews once in a while but I think it is just from habit . I would recommend this . Amazon has it at a great price , too .	1
She is n't a very picky eater but I 'm picky about what we feed her . This food is a decent quality at a reasonable price . So far she has n't had any issues with it and no allergic reactions . Will continue to feed to her .	1
I have greyhounds and they have sensitive stomachs . After speaking with other grey owners , I decided to try this food as it is less expensive than Wellness . It seems to agree with them just fine ! Whew ! Do not , however , buy it from Pet Food Direct ! Where do they get off charging Almost $ 14.00 for delivery ? ! ? ! It is sold at Petco , Petsmart and Pet Supplies Plus .	1
On June 15 I adopted a 2yr old jack-a-poo which was rescue from a puppy mill . Every time he ate he would make strange sounds . He would also throw up a lot . The foster mom had him eating wellness brand . I had him for 2 months and really had no idea what to do.I switch him over to Purina Pro Plan Sensitive skin and Stomach just to see if that would help . I am surprise at the result . It is like having a new dog . He no long makes sounds or throw up . If he drinks water to fast he coughs but , other then that this food has fixed his issues.I highly recommend this if your dog has issues eating they may just need a different diet .	1
It smells good . The ingredient list is impressive , as is the nutritional analysis .	1
The pieces are really small so if you have an old dog of small dog , they can chew it easily . My picky dogs ate it just fine and the one allergic to corn did n't have any seizures on this food . I bought it here first before I found it at my local feed store but the price here is better . I would definitely purchase this again .	1
Both my Golden Retriever and mini Aussie love this product . My mini Aussie is a picky eater , and he adores this flavor	1
So sick of switching food because of recalls - even the top-rated , expensive foods . My older boxer has a sensitive stomach and as soon as I 'd find a good food , it would get recalled again . He 's been on this brand now for a few months and it 's been going well . Works for my younger guy , too .	1
This product has better ingredients at a better price than some lesser quality foods . I 'm still debating making my own dog food . They suggest not giving dogs table food , but cheaper dog food typically costs $ 1/pound . I have a difficult time purchasing food for my family that 's $ 1/pound ( we eat A LOT of chicken for that reason ) . Chicken is currently $ 0.49/pound . Homemade dog food is looking very cost effective these days . Either way , apples to apples , this is a reasonable purchase . It does n't cause my dog flatulence like some other brands .	1
I have gotten into getting decent dog food and this is one of the best . It is pretty much all decent ingredients and my dogs like this stuff . I have bigger and smaller and they can all eat it . Check the ratings anywhere and you will see this is one of the better . It is a great price and if you have Amazon prime shipping is free . Great value for the money .	1
Been using this for awhile now . I have three dogs . A husky , a husky mix and a Rottweiler . They love this food for one . Amazon ships it in a big box to keep it safe . It is very healthy compared to most dog foods . It is pretty cheap and it fills them up ! I only have to buy one bag a month because it is so filling . They are healthier and stronger looking . Their fur is shinier than ever . They have muscles I never seen before . They are lean and more energetic . Their teeth have become more white and less stinky breath even ! I will never stop buying this for them ! Good dogs deserve the best food ! This is it . Their is nothing I dislike about this food ! NOTHING .	1
Have 2 rescues and just switched to this according to other reviews . They ate it up and the price was right.Diamond Naturals Dry Food for Adult Dog , Beef and Rice Formula , 40 Pound Bag	1
I found this to be the best bargain for a higher quality dog food , comparable to Wellness and Blue Buffalo . My dogs both love it and one of my dogs that often gets topical yeast infections does not have problems on this food so its not full of bread filler . The only other food comparable for my dog 's yeast problem is Wellness and it got too pricy for me . I did notice a salmonella recall on the Diamond lamb flavor , spring of 2012 , so I keep an alert on my google news , but its the only recall I 've seen and it went public fast , right on the Diamond site and there were no fatalities because it was dealt with well . Still , good to know .	1
Hey if my dog loves this thing that means is good ! I know , you 'd be like all dogs love food , but mine is different . He eats mostly meat , and this is just like something to be over there . I usually give him a coup and a half , and will last him 1 1/2 day . He is very picky when it come to dog food , and this was the first time when he actually eat that just like that . I have an old school pitbull , 67-68 pounds average .	1
This was recommended by the breeder . He is doing great on this food . He loves it and we have no complaints aside from odd price fluctuations on Amazon . Right now it is listed for less than I paid for our last shipment . I do n't get it . Still a good price with free delivery for a good product that is hard to find in our local stores .	1
I use to feed my dogs Taste of the Wild ( TOTW ) but when we added the GSD to our family I could no longer afford it . So I switched to Diamond as it is one of the best economy brands out there . All my dogs love it and they have beautiful soft coats.IngredientsBeef meal , cracked pearled barley , ground rice , peas , egg product , rice bran , chicken fat ( preserved with mixed tocopherols ) , fish meal , dried plain beet pulp , pea protein , millet , flaxseed , natural flavor , potassium chloride , salt , choline chloride , vitamin E supplement , iron proteinate , zinc proteinate , copper proteinate , ferrous sulfate , zinc sulfate , copper sulfate , potassium iodide , thiamine mononitrate , manganese proteinate , manganous oxide , ascorbic acid , vitamin A supplement , biotin , niacin , calcium pantothenate , manganese sulfate , sodium selenite , pyridoxine hydrochloride ( vitamin B6 ) , vitamin B12 supplement , riboflavin , vitamin D supplement , folic acid.Crude Protein 25.0 % MinimumCrude Fat 15.0 % MinimumCrude Fiber 4.0 % MaximumMoisture 10.0 % MaximumZinc 150 mg/kg MinimumSelenium 0.25 mg/kg MinimumVitamin E 150 IU/kg MinimumOmega-6 Fatty Acids * 2.4 % MinimumOmega-3 Fatty Acids * 0.4 % Minimum	1
You would not believe all the trouble I went through with my dog and so called dog foods . I even tried some of the really expensive stuff and I would still have to spend a fortune ( again ) on wet food for her to even eat it . So I came across this and after reading many many reviews I took the plunge . OMG ! ! ! ! for the first time ever my dog eats this food ( on a regular basis ) by it 's self . I am now almost done with my first bag and will be buying another two . This dog food even smells good , and for any dog that is a huge deal . I will not hesitate to tell my friends about this brand .	1
Our family recently got on a healthy foods kick , and I thought & # 34 ; Hey , what about the dog ? & # 34 ; So we started to look into what is actually in dog food . Bad news folks , it 's mostly all some kind of filler like corn , wheat , and ground up chicken bits that do n't really qualify as meat . You ever wonder why your dog is so fat ? He 's addicted to the carb filler in his dog food just like you are addicted to cherry pie and those great breadsticks at olive garden ! I 'm not going to go into a big description of how the glycemic index works , but all those carbs and lack of nutrition in his cheap dog fog make him eat more and get fat . You & # 8217 ; ll notice the serving size on really expensive dog food is much lower because there is actually meat in there and no filler . Even everyone & # 8217 ; s favorite Science Diet has a heck of a lot of filler in it . I recommend Diamond Naturals because this is the cheapest no filler dog food that you are likely to find . And I can tell you it has made a difference . We used to feed regular old Dog Chow and our three year old lab was fat , her coat was dull and she had occasional digestive problems . On the Diamond she is down to her ideal weight , she & # 8217 ; s not sick anymore , and her coat is like black glass . She & # 8217 ; s the prettiest dog you & # 8217 ; ll ever see . If you love your dog read the label on their food . You don & # 8217 ; t have to buy diamond , but if you do you won & # 8217 ; t be disappointed .	1
This food is cheap , easy to get , and decent quality . It 's not the best , but it 's good enough and I 'll likely keep buying it.Diamond is a large manufacturer . They make Natural Balance brand food , which is good and what I used to use . Comparing Diamond brand vs. Diamond-made Natural Balance brand there are two main differences : Diamond is a larger bag for much cheaper.Natural Balance uses primarily Chicken , and then Lamb and Duck Meal . Diamond uses Beef Meal.So both use meal , but Diamond uses more/only meal . Is there a big difference ? Probably not . Meal just means it 's cooked and ground up . Most sources seem to agree that meal is not necessarily any worse than plain meat . What is bad is `` by product '' , and neither food has this . Also bad are fillers like corn , which neither food has , either.I tried Diamond when I could n't get Natural Balance on Prime and I needed dog food . The ( substantially ) lower price did not hurt . I knew it would n't be as good quality , but figured it would be good enough.One dog was fine with the Diamond . The other had seriously bad `` problems '' on and off for about 3 weeks . In fairness , he does n't do well with any diet changes and had been eating Natural Balance for 9 years straight . I believe the issues were not because of the Diamond , but because of a change . Meaning I could have bought the best food on earth , and I think he still would have had issues . If this changes and he develops problems again , I will assume it is the food and will update the review.Now that both dogs are fine with this food , I will probably stick with it . It 's cheap , easy to get , and the quality is good . If I have issues , I will switch back to Natural Balance , but for now I do n't see a point in paying more for rather similar food .	1
I switched to Diamond Naturals some time ago , and I am sticking with it . Finally a dog food withoutall the junk , chemicals , and artificial ingredients.Read the label , and be pleasantly surprised . Mytwo dogs both thrive on it . Other than the 4Healthbrand from Tractor Supply , it is the only onethat is natural and without all those grain fillers , that is affordable at the same time .	1
Review sites list this close to the top for pet health . The only disputed content is tomato pumice and that is argued over . That 's even less likely to contribute because it is well down the ingredients list . This ranking places it well above many vet and feed store premium items .	1
My dogs have fought ear infections all of their lives . I switched to Diamond Chicken and Rice dog foods and their ears cleared up but they were always licking their paws and one of my dogs cut way back on how much she was eating , I switched from the chicken and rice to this and their ears are still clean , they do not lick their paws near as much and the dog who was hardly eating is eating me out of house and home . I love this stuff !	1
We have 3 large breed and one medium breed dogs in our household . Wanted to find a quality food they all liked , could digest well , and have no skin problems . This one seems to be fitting the bill so far . And they ALL just love it ! Good quality for a fair price , thanks Amazon .	1
The food is probably good , but it gave my dog severe diarrhea ... I ended up feeding all of it to her , sometimes decent , usually mushy . It sucked ! But she really did like the food , so I say it 's a pretty good item if your dog can digest Beef and Rice Properly . My dog digs Lamb and rice =\	1
My dog loves this food ! I feel good about it because of it 's great ingredients and I love Amazon 's price !	1
I already left a review on chicken and rice . I always get the benefit of home delivery . Forty lbs . of dog food is getting hard for me to carry up the stairs and I appreciate the poor delivery guy or gal who lugs all that dog food to my door . The quality is wonderful !	1
So happy with this food . It is a great product at a great price . My dogs love it . the free shipping was super fast . You ca n't really go wrong.. : )	1
The important thing is that all three of my dogs like this dog food ; I have noticed a slight drop of weightThey are all a little on the plump side , so I think this is probably a good thing . I had been giving themTaste of the wild and I plan to buy more in the future . .	1
My dogs love this food , it is great as it has ingredients that I can understand and know what they are : and no biproducts ! It has one of the higher ratings among the dog food lists . I have been letting my two dobies use this for this reason . It lists no biproducts and Beef meal and barley and rice are the first three ingredients . I have to say it is great dog food for the price , as we are on extreme budgeting in this household ; and with Amazon , it qualifies for free shipping , which makes it even more appealing ! Thanks , Patti Roth	1
We were using Diamond Lamb and Rice for Puppies , but all of a sudden our dog had diarrhea that just was n't clearing up . The vet did every test in the book , and they were all fine . So we changed his food , thinking maybe the lamb just was n't doing it for him , and chose this Beef Meal and Rice Formula . His stomach issues cleared right up , but now he only eats his food once a day , when he used to inhale it twice . I think he does n't like the new flavor . He 'll inhaled it when his Natural Balance wet food is mixed in , though !	1
I have five dogs and in this economy with so many people giving up their pets as they ca n't afford them , I decided to look for a still decent ( not all byproduct and corn ) but not expensive food and I found it.All my dogs love it , and I rotate between the other flavors too.I know its not top line and people can nitpick on some ingredients but for $ 30 with free delivery , its a great deal .	1
When I got a puppy , I wanted to feed him a food that had no fillers and was rated high . Since my dogs seem to share a bowl , my older 12 year old dog started eating it also . I noticed after about a month on this food , her arthritis was not as bad and moves around a lot easier . For that reason alone , I will not switch to another food .	1
Let me start off by saying my dog has no digestive issues . I buy this food because its great quality dog food for the price . It has no wheat of corn in it . She used to eat a more expensive food , because I wanted the best for my Mutt . I did research and found this at Pet Supplies Plus for $ 30 .	1
My dog seems to love this dog food . When ever my mom comes to visit with her dogs , they always eat this over their own dog food ! My dog has been noticeably healthier and his coat is much more shiny . Only reason its not five stars is because I can find it cheaper at the local feed store . Not that its really a bad thing for me .	1
I used to get the Kirkland brand ( made by Diamond ) , but now I buy it online and have it delivered to my door . No need for a costco card anymore .	1
I have a 75 pound hound dog who has a tendency to gain weight easily . This dog food filled her up quickly - she was n't even finishing the entire bowl of food , which is a first for her . It allowed me to feed her a little less and yet still supply her with plenty of energy for her daily romps and sniffing marathons . Not much to look at , but good ingredients for the price .	1
I 've been trying to switch my dog to healthy kibble for a long time now , but I refused to be marketed into paying for overpriced natural food in tiny bags . The bow wow loves this stuff and I feel good about the price . Win-win overall .	1
I love all of the Natural Balance products . My Boxer has a sensitive stomach , and she does well on them . I highly recommend this line of dog treats and food .	1
I order Natural Balance food for my pit bull , because of allergies . She gobbles it down.Even the salmon and potato , which I will never order again due to the smell . Anyway , she liked the salmon . I prefer the lamb and duck for her.Most dog food contains chicken or turkey , which she can not have .	1
My dogs eat this food every day so know that these biscuits are safe and truly grain free and wont cause stomach upset	1
I have purchased another blend of Natural Balance Limited ingredients and have been happy with it and this one as well . My little dog now can enjoy a treat . This brand has been excellent .	1
My little dog has severe food allergies so that I must carefully screen all that she eats . She absolutely loves these and she tolerates them with no side affects whatsoever .	1
My dog loves them . I 've stopped ordering them from Amazon though because my local pet store sells them for four-ninety nine and has an ongoing deal where if you buy three bags , you get the 4th free.. Check out your local pet store for better prices.These are great quality , safe treats . My dog eats the dry , limited ingredient diet food for small breeds . He 's a pug with allergies and has never had a problem with these treats or the kibble.I recommend trying these with your pet . Get them from your local pet store for a much better price .	1
My male cat has a lot of allergies . I 've tried using many products to boost his immune system and add luster to his coat . I also happen to show dogs and use the Nupro Gold on my show line of animals with great results so I decided to try cat nuggets . WONDERFUL . At first my male cat was n't to keen on eating it , the female gobbled it down . After a few days he ate it fine . I just sprinkle a 1/2 teaspoon on their individual breakfast . You can also mash it up into can food . Male cat no longer has the runs , coat looks amazing , and no allergy issues taking this supplement . ( He 's allergic to grain and certain cat litters ) . Female cat also looks amazing but she never had much of an issue looking fab !	1
I thought my 13 yr old cat was on her way out : coughing , sneezing , not eating , eyes wide ... hundreds spent at the vet with NO diagnosis after xrays of chest , GI tract , etc. , except to try antibiotics ( I did not ) . At the same time I had gotten 2 kittens who had horrific diarrhea ... they were on their 3rd med . I tried another product ( dropper liquid ) from the same company said to cure kitten diarrhea , but no one would eat it . But when I bought that stuff , I also got this , since it sounded like it could n't hurt and might provide something `` missing from regular cat food . '' 2 months later , the old girl is looking very good ; the kittens ' diarrhea is gone . Everybody seems to have benefited and I suspect that it really IS because some of the ingredients are needed but not included in regular cat food . Try it ! A lb . lasts a long time since you give only about a half teaspooon per cat ... and they all love it as treats ... if I 'd let them get at it . Definitely worth a try if you 're having unknown `` issues '' which you or vet ca n't figure out or solve ! !	1
Not only do my cats love this product , it made the dander go away off their fur and honestly the poop did n't have such a terrible smell when I gave this to them regularly .	1
This stuff is awesome ! My cats love the taste so much that they think they 're being fed treats ! I give this to all 13 of my cats and so far I have seen alot of improvements . I would highly recommend this product .	1
We 've been using this unit with multiple furry cats who like to dip their paws in the water . It has lasted well over a year . You do need to take it apart and clean it once a month or so . Every 3-4 months clean out the pump as well . The submersible pump is fully servicable : if you snap off the screen over the water intake you can take out the impeller and rinse any muck off of it . When I did this the one time the pump got stuck.. it ran like new ever since.I do wish this unit was easier to clean , but I have n't seen a better model yet and the price is very resonable.If you are willing to keep the water level from emptying ( which keeps it quiet ) and are willing to clean this unit and replace its filters regularly , your cats will love it . I think this fountain is a good value overall.If I were to change anything , I would have designed the filter to get the water before the pump does . This would probably mean you would never have to clean out the pump .	1
I 've had this fountain for over 2 years now and my cats still love it . So if they were writing this I 'm sure they would give this 5 Stars , however since I 'm the one that has to clean it and buy the filters I give it 4.Cleaning : This thing is a pain to clean . I even put it in a separate room away from their food so they would stop dropping their food in the bowl . But because paws still like to go in the water it still needs cleaned once a week and I dreaded doing it . If purchasing I would invest in some pipe cleaners because there are some hard-to-reach places - including the reservoir.Filters : For 2 cats a filter would last about a month , if I rinsed it when I cleaned the fountain . And when the filter becomes dirty all the carbon chunks sink to the bottom of the filter impeding on the water flow making it weak . I was n't impressed with filter ability as I expected it to actually filter . Filters run about $ 6.99 for a two pack.This sounds like less than a 4 star review but after 2 years of buying filters and cleaning the fountain every week a lightbulb finally went off in my head.I ran out of filters and could n't get to the store for a few days so I just cleaned and refilled the fountain without the filter . Genius ! The water flow stayed strong and since the flow was circulating faster and stronger it keeps the fountain cleaner longer . And since I got rid of the filters I 've been having to fill the reservoir more probably because my cats drink from it more due to the stronger current.So I would recommend this fountain to my friends and tell them to eliminate the filters but still keep an eye on the fountain for cleanliness .	1
My three feline children love their water fountains . They have two fountains at my house.PROS:1 . The cats drink more water because they seem to be attracted to the flowing aspect of the water . Additional water consumption is good for cats and people.2 . Since the water is filtered it is fresher and cleaner than a bowl of water.CONS:1 . There are little crevices that are very difficult to clean . I have resorted to using a steam cleaner to thoroughly clean the fountain once a week . On a daily basis I use a small brush and mild dish soap . Then I allow the fountain to thoroughly dry to eliminate any bacteria that were not removed with soap and water before refilling with water.2 . Because the sides are low one of my felines manages to splash significant quantities of water out of the bowl as he drinks leaving a little river on the floor . I have found that placing the fountain in a half sheet pan solves this problem but gives me something else to clean.OTHER OBSERVATIONS:1 . I have not had any difficulty with algae in the bowl or feline acne . This may to due to my fastidious cleaning routine.2 . I have also not had any problems with pumps malfunctioning . But I do take the fountains apart completely every day and clean them , including the pump intakes.3 . I change the filter every month , just as I do for our household water filter . No sense in risking bacterial growth for a less than $ 2 a filter.In summation I enjoy this product , because the felines enjoy it . It is not maintenance free , but does result in kitty 's that consume more fresh water . If you do n't mind 5 minutes of additional work a day I would recommend the product .	1
I 've wanted to buy one of these fountains for my kitties for years.Last week it was one of the Deals on Amazon , so I splurged and bought a $ 25 gift for my kitties ! They love it . I like having it there , it makes barely any noise , just a light trickle . The kitties love it , drink from it and play with the water stream.It 's got a nice long cord , though I need an extension to put it where I want it . I like the on/off switch on the cord , and the water filter . It came with extra filters , at least a year 's supply . Great value .	1
ThePetmate Deluxe Fresh Flow Medium Pet Fountainis so quiet and works great . I have a 3 pound Chihuahua and a 14 pound Chinese Crested Hairless and the size is perfect for the two of them . I highly recommend this to any petite to small animal owner . It only needs to be refilled once a day and it is very easy to clean .	1
I gave this to my mother for Christmas . She has an old cat who loves to play in water and she had always talked about some day getting him a pet water fountain . I had read a few other reviews and was a little leery as to how well this would work , but gave it a try.Her cat loves it ! From day 1 there have been no problems with it . And best of all , it VERY quiet . You ca n't hear it at all ! She has it set up in her living room . I did n't even know it was there.I would just make sure you always have it filled with water so the pump does n't burn out on you . Because cats drink so much water with this , when you first get it , you should watch the water levels so that you get an idea on how often you should replenish the water supply.Absolutely great product !	1
This is my second drinkwell fountain and I love it . I have owned others but the cats prefer this these . The cats drink more water and spill less on the floor . It 's a good value and everyone is happy . Not easy when you live with cats .	1
I was a little concerned with buying the fountian because my 12 year old male cat is very picky . The fountian arrived in a pretty good amount of time . And really was n't to hard to but the together . After staring at the fountain for awhile my cat finally decides to use it . I would recommend this product to someone else .	1
I recieved this fountain in the mail approximately 2 weeks , ago , so I will enter a new review later if my opinion changes ... That said , this is a great fountain so far . Fairly easy to assemble , extremely quiet ( almost silent ) , and very easy to refill ... you can leave it running , remove the water container , refill and replace without having to turn the unit off.That said , it is not the petmate `` deluxe '' model..no in-line power switch , no flow adjustment valve ... so , do n't buy this if you are looking for those features.Only time will tell if the pump continues to work as silently and as quietly as it has so far , but as of now , this is a good purchase for the money ... given the mistake in labeling it as `` deluxe '' . It is still at least $ 10.00 cheaper than the same model at my local pet chain store .	1
I have owned a few fountains for my cat and this is the best one that I 've tried . It does have some flaws as noted by the other reviewers - sometimes gets loud and cleaning can be kind of a pain ( but not nearly as bad as some others I 've had ) . I can imagine that cleaning it would be more of a problem with dogs who tend to get food in their water , but I just take it apart every couple of weeks when I swap out the water and wipe everything down with a sponge and that seems to do the trick . As for the pump noises , it does get noisy when the water level gets low , but as long as you keep it fairly full , it seems to be fine . Again , this would probably be more of a problem with dogs that drink more water . My cat was originally a little hesitant to drink out of it , but now she will only drink this fountain , although I keep other bowls of water around the house . For the price , I am very satisfied .	1
I have read the reviews on this product , have purchased it three times through Amazon , and have dealt with the pump problem also . I continue to use this particular fountain because it sounds like all pet fountains have some issue with the pumps and being difficult to clean , and this is the least expensive fountain I 've found . AS FOR THE PUMP ISSUE : yes , it will burn out very quickly if you do n't keep the water level up , but the humming sound alerts you . Also , sometimes the pump is just a faulty one . But , having said that , if you have a pump issue , you should know that the company is VERY prompt in helping you if you just call them . Here is the number : 1-877-PETMATE . They will either replace or repair your pump . You do have to mail them the old pump which is the only inconvenience , and I did pay a couple of dollars for shipping . However , within only a few days , I received a new pump in the mail . Here is further contact information : PetmateP.O .

I just got this today . I 'm very impressed with how quiet it is . My friend had an old old one from a long time ago ( I dunno what brand ) and that thing made a lot of noise and splash . This was perfectly quiet , ca n't even hear it . Also it does not make a splash due to the slide . I have 4 cats , and only one of them actually noticed it , and she seems to really like it ! Before I knew it , her face and her paws were all wet because she had so much fun playing and drinking . It comes with 2 filter packs , which is suppose to last 2 months . I 'm not too impressed with the filters . Kinda flimsy , but it served it purpose.My only complaint about this product , which prevents me from giving it 5 stars , is the suction cup where the pump is suppose to attach to the fountain is flimsy , and does not really attach the pump to the fountain . But since that part gets covered up anyways , I guess it does n't really matter.Overall , ( at least so far ) a great product . I would recommend it .	1
We initially bought a Drinkwell Big-Dog Pet Fountain , figuring it would encourage our puppy to drink more water , but returned it immediately because the water reservoir was flimsy and the motor was way too noisy . We had better luck with the second order , a Petmate Fresh Flow Pet Fountain , Jumbo size , for our large breed puppy . It is working perfectly and silently , too .	1
I 've been using several months & am well pleased . It 's silent unless it 's running low on water , which is great , because I 'd forget to check it otherwise . The cats like it and it keeps the water fresh and clean . I take it apart and clean out the hair that gathers around the pump once or month or so .	1
Both our cats drink more water from this Fresh Flow device - because water is filtered and flows gently for their interest . We have had this fine device for nearly 2 years without problems.We have found that replacement filters are not that great - we are using Tetra Whisper Bio-Bag Cartridge small , 2-Pack ( fits perfectly ) seems more effective .	1
My cat loves her fountain ! ! She really likes to drink right from the little hole at the top where the water comes out . The only complaint I have about this item is the frequent cleaning . I guess cats just naturally get saliva in their water , and this fountain will need to be cleaned about weekly , otherwise , your cat is n't getting that nice , fresh water you were thinking about when you bought it . I take the fountain outside and give it a good wash with a little soap and bleach , ( and of course a good rinse ) and it 's good to go . Sometimes I put ice cubes in the bowl , which the cat really likes . Be sure to check the little grille over the pump intake for cat hair.I 've had this for over a year and it 's still working fine .	1
Update on my original review ... it 's now June 2005 , I originally purchased this product mid-2003 . It 's still running like new , I still love it , and so do my cats.Original review : I bought this item several months ago thinking my Maine Coon would love it since she loves running water . Well , both she and my Norwegian Forest Cat love it . I do n't think it 's difficult to clean . Everything comes apart very easily . The filter comes apart in 3 pieces so you can really clean out any clogs . I ca n't see why anyone would complain about cleaning it , would n't they clean their cats ' water bowls ? The fact that I only clean this once a week is a breeze . My only problem was that my cat kept taking off the very top piece with her paw , then removing the filter . I now tape the top piece down after each cleaning and that has solved the problem . I 've owned this product for several months and it still works as if it were brand new . I think my cats are attracted to the `` fountain '' aspect , as they seem to be drinking a lot more water than when they were given standing water in a regular bowl . I whole heartedly recommend this product .	1
I 've owned these for more than ten years . The point of having them is to provide running water , which cats like . Most complaints are about cleaning and noise . Cleaning is indeed necessary , much more often if you have more than one cat , and when new the parts are difficult to take apart . A little rocking of the top when taking the top off helps when new and eases with use . The bowl should be scrubbed with a mesh scrubber and a bottle brush helps get into tubes and corners . A rinse with diluted vinegar reduces lime scaling . Cleaning the pump is quick , easy and necessary . See felinediabetes.com/petmate_freshflow_cleaning.htm for excellent instructions and do n't skip cleaning the impeller . Reduced flow is caused by either a dirty pump , which shortens its life , or a dirty filter . A clogged filter can also cause an overflow . Noise can be caused by not seating the pump carefully on the floor of the bowl after cleaning , but a rattling noise is just a sign of low water level . The pump is lubricated with water . If it runs dry it will burn up quickly . Just as with a plain bowl , water should be added every day . The reservoir should not be needed ; it is a very temporary backup . This is just a machine , and it does take routine maintenance , but given that it will perform well for years . I keep a spare pump on hand ; like everything , including us , it will eventually wear out , but replacing it essentially restores the Petmate to new condition . In more than ten years I 've had to replace a pump only once . It 's true that these used to have a variable flow lever and Petmate should restore that feature .	1
We 've had this for over two years with no problems . Our vet recommended a fountain after Fiona , as a kittten , was plagued with a UTI and some related issues . The price of the fountain was reasonable . After spending over $ 1,000 on vet bills we decided that it was worth it to take a chance on the fountain . Fiona and Ginger took to it immediately . For weeks , Noodles , the oldest , would stare at it for long periods of time , and then go to the old bowl . After watching how the other two use the fountain , she eventually became a convert.With three cats using it , the reservoir becomes nearly empty each day , but that 's OK as we would replenish daily , anyhow . It would be a problem if we went away for a couple days and had no pet sitter . Each day when I refill the water , I squirt a small amount of apple cider vinegar in the area just above the slide . ( Using one of the pet med syringes , I fill to the `` 4 '' mark -- not sure if it 's ml or cc . ) I think it helps with their health , makes their coats shiny , etc.Total cleaning is a project , which I do weekly in the winter and more often in the summer . In the summer , more hair and goo accumulates around the edge of the bowl and , more especially , at the pump . My cleaning `` kit '' consists of an old toothbrush , Dawn detergent , a sponge makeup wedge , and tweezers . There are corners in the back part of the bowl , expecially near the pump , that are hard to clean . Occasionally , using an old Water Pic attachment , I flush out the inside of the pump . The first time , loads of black gunk gushed out of the hole , and a lot had accumulated in other areas in the pump . Because the pump is black , and the goo is black , it was easy to overlook its existence with a fast , normal cleaning.Best news : Since buying the fountain there have been no more health issues ( knock wood ) .We 'd buy another one , but would most likely see what else is out there that cleans more easily , and holds more water to make it better for three cats .	1
This Petmate medium size water fountain has turned out to be a very good item compared to the last Petmate medium one that I had bought several years ago . This has a slightly more powerful water pump compared to my last one . The water filters with the fountain is the only thing that slows the water flow down too much after a few days of running . Their filters are quite thick in substance for the water to flow through . I have found that the small Whisper brand of water filters for the fish tanks work real well with this water fountain versus using Petmates filters .	1
I have had it for maybe 6 years . Also purchased the other type , I forget the name of that brand , it has more of a spout than this one , which is more of a flow . I have 8 cats , some really like the flow , some just want to drink from a bowl . I do n't consider this noisy . I do n't bother with the filter , consider that kind of useless . If the pump gets blocked by junk ( will occur with or without using a filter ) it will get noisy , or if the water gets low . That is your clue to add water or clean it . If you ever shelled out $ 500 because one of your cats had urinary blockage , you do n't consider anything that encourages your cats to drink more water a bad idea . I also suggest filtered water ( I use the attachment for my tap ) , cats really go for filtered water more . Bottom line , some of my cats just love this , and they all prefer it to the alternate brand . My tom 's all go for it , and male cats are more prone to urinary blockage .	1
Purchased this Petmate Deluxe Fresh Flow a couple of weeks ago . It makes a soft running water noise , pleasant to hear . My cat immediately started drinking from it , as she loves running water . Keeps water fresh and clean for her . easy to reload - just unhook the cord from the plug and take to sink . Makes a loud noise when there is debris in it ( bugs , food , whatever ) to let you know it must be cleaned out ! so much easier than refilling the water dish all the time ...	1
My cats love this . The moving water actually helps cool it off which my cats prefer . Since buying it 8 months ago , both of my cats have ceased drinking from the toilet bowl after I flush it ( they love that cool , moving water ) . Yes , it accumlates fur , but as long as you clean it thoroughly once a week ( takes 5-10 minutes ) , everything is fine . The motor is incredibly quiet if you have the item assembled properly . After taking it apart and putting it back together , sometimes you have to do it again if it is noisy . Not a big deal since THE CATS LOVE IT ! The only complaint I have is that the charcoal filter is AFTER the motor ... so it does n't filter out any fur or other gunk from the motor ... . which is why you have to disassemble the motor ( VERY easy ) in your cleaning process once a week .	1
I have had two more of these fountains and they are great.So much better than the Cats sitting in the sink and waiting by the faucet looking for running water or drips.Little to no problems with the fountains over 2 years.No leaks , drips or puddles on the floorI had one power supply die after 2 years of continuous use but even with that problem I highly recommend the product.A side benefit is it very intriguing and a constant source of interest for my 2 Girls .	1
My cats love this fountain because it keeps the water fresh . I love this fountain because it 's quiet and easy to clean . I usually clean it once a week and change the filter twice a week . To clean it I usually soak it in a bleach/water solution for ten or fifteen minutes , and then use dishsoap and water and a baby bottle brush to clean it . I have owned this fountain for about eight years , and at first , the filter stopped working after just a couple of months . Iwas dissapointed and almost threw it in the trash , but I figure it might just need a good cleaning and took it apart to see if I could clean it with vinegar . It worked ! ! Now , I keep the pump in perfect condition by once a month filling a bowl with vinegar and submerging the pump in it , then I plug in the pump and let it run for 1/2 an hr or so to get rid of any mineral build up . Once this is done , I unplug the pump , rinse it , and put it back in the fountain . My fountain works like new . The only reason I gave this product a four star is because this unit does n't hold as much water as the Drinkwell fountain . I wish they would redesing it with a larger water capacity .	1
I had researched a number of the pet fountains and read most of the reviews here on Amazon for them . The reviews from a lot of shoppers left me a little leary of any fountain at all for my cats actually . I worried about hair , noise , clogging , and leakage . Finally , I spotted the Petmate Deluxe Fresh Flow Fountain in the linen color as a Lightning deal and I decided to take the plunge . It was n't the color I was originally considering but it actually blends in nicely in my kitchen.A couple of my cats respond better to running water and actually lack the depth perception that is required to make drinking from a bowl easy . They were always getting water up their noses when they tried to drink . And I really wanted to make sure all 4 were getting proper hydration . My cats took to it right away , but I was able to sit it in the same place I had kept their water bowl . I have been told that if you have to move it from where you did keep their water dish because of the need for an electrical outlet , your cat might take a couple of days to figure it all out.It is quiet and I never hear it running as long as I have enough water in it . If you begin to hear the pump running check your water level . At first it seemed like I was filling it up a lot , but with 4 cats I think they are just really drinking more because it is easier for them now . If you put the water tank back in and it makes a `` glugging '' sound like you get when you turn over a full bottle of liquid to pour out you will probably have to take it off and fill it again because your water was very low.It is not maintenance free . I take it all apart weekly for a cleaning and rinse out the filter . I have not had to take this particular pump apart for cleaning yet , but it does come with clear directions and it does n't look any different from cleaning our fish tank pumps . It takes me about 10-15 minutes to break it down , wash it , dry it and get it all back together and filled.After all the research and straddling the fence , not sure which fountaint to buy , if any , I am very pleased with this fountain and I would definitely recommend it .	1
We bought this for our cat a couple weeks ago and it has been great . I really was n't too sure of what to expect , but figured we 'd give it a shot . It 's less than $ 30 so why not right ? It was slightly confusing putting everything where it belonged because the directions in the box are for the one you 're getting as well as their deluxe kit , which you are to skip over . After it was all done and running , our cat could n't wait to check it out ! Right away he was drinking the water and sometimes at night I catch him trying to play/fish in it ! It really does n't make much noise at all . The sound of the water stream is actually pretty soothing . If it makes any noise then you need to fill up the water reservoir . I have no problems with this and I love the fact that it 's filtering his water . We all love it !	1
Cats naturally do not drink the water they need to keep their body properly hydrated . It 's even worse when they are not fed a diet of mostly wet food to balance the hydration out . My wife and I are busy people , so for convenience sake we feed dry food a majority of the time . We opted to buy this fountain to see if it made a difference in their drinking habits.The cats LOVE IT ! ! Within an hour 's time you will generally see at least one of our three cats drinking out of it ! We have both made the comment that it was the best $ 30 we ever spent on our cats . The freshflow fountain intrigues the cats and they play with the water coming out of the top . Our female cat drinks straight from the spigot , just like a kid at a water fountain.The unit does have to be cleaned out about once a month , otherwise you will hear a dreadful grinding and gurgling sound . This does n't mean the unit has died , even if it stops working . Simply take apart the unit and clean it out . You can view the instructions here : [ ... ] It 's a very helpful site for getting rid of the gunk in your FreshFlow system . Replace the filter often , too.Bottom line , if you have multiple cats , or even just one cat and you care about their health - buy this machine , it is not a gimmick , it is a wonderful tool for your cats ' hydration and well-being . You will see a drastic impovement - as much as 500 % - in the consistency of your cat 's water intake ! JUST BUY IT !	1
I 've had the med . size Fresh Flow for years , and the cats and myself love it , in spite of the fact that debris can collect in the bowl ( I solved that problem long ago , by using a turkey baster to suck out food bits , etc.. , ! ) . I now have five kitty mouths to water , and the med . just did n't cut it any more , so I purchased the Jumbo . It has pretty much the identical design , except for a small spout at the top of the return flow tube that delivers water to the filter . I assume this is because there is a greater distance for the water to travel with the jumbo , but not sure . While the med . made absolutely no descernible noise , the jumbo made a constant trickling sound . For some reason , after using it for a while.. couple weeks.. it is n't making the noise any more ! The med . size released water to keep it at a level of `` below the rim , but this jumbo one does n't add water until the level in the bowl drops to an inch below the rim ... fairly minor difference . I sort of expected a more powerful pump , though , in retrospect , it does n't seem to affect performance at all . All in all ... Positives : I like how much water the reservoir holds ; it does n't spatter at all , like so many other brands do ; it is ( now ) totally quiet ; The `` kids '' love it ; the price was very right ! Negatives : I wish it kept the water level a bit higher ( just a minor negative ) ; still wish Pet Mate could find a way to have their products circulate the water strongly enough to catch debris , even though I 've found a `` work-around '' ; o ) If they could do that last thing- I 'd consider pretty close to perfect . As it stands , it 's still my first choice , and I would recommend it , in whatever size makes sense , as a great way to supply cool , oxygenated water to your cat ( s ) , especially since cats often do n't drink enough water to supplement the dry food many eat . Of course- great for the woofers , too !	1
I purchased this Jumbo drinking fountain to make sure my cats would drink more water . More water they drink the less I have to worry about with urinary infections . All my cats love this fountain . Some drink at the bottom tray and others will drink from the top where the water is just coming out.It keeps the water cool all the time . My only problem is when my 2 Labs come into the house and when they drink they will devour the whole thing and I have to watch to make sure that the water does not get below motor.So far I have had this fountain for about 6 months and it is very quiet , easy to install and easy to clean.Julie	1
This fountain replaced a Drinkwell fountain that my two cats gave up on after a year of use . I spent the past year wondering whether it was worth trying to buy another fountain or just let them drink from the dripping faucet ( which is the older one 's preference ) .This fountain has several improvements over the previous fountain : *very large capacity in a compact space , over 200 oz . with no extra water bottles attached to the back*silent ! Our previous fountain made a lot of noise when the stream of water hit the bowl . This one is quiet , and I ca n't even hear the pump . *power switch on the cordBoth of my cats ( ages 2 and 6 ) love the new fountain . The older has not once tried to drink from the faucet ( which I appreciate ) . They are also drinking a lot more water.This fountain is certainly big enough for more than 2 cats . ( Does that mean I can get another one ? ! ? ) I was actually surprised by how large it is ... perhaps it is intended for dogs , but I love how much water it holds .	1
I have 2 Dachshunds and a cat and this fountain is perfect . Purchased a different fountain and it stopped working after a few days . This fountain got great reviews , that 's the reason why I got it and I 'm very pleased with it . My pets have no trouble drinking out of it and they have fresh water all of the time . I do empty the water out and wash the bowl twice a week to get out the junk that the dogs ' leave from drinking , which I would do with any bowl . Other than that , I 'm sold !	1
My cats started drinking a lot more water after I bought this . The intention of this product is to mimic flowing water . Cats love water movement , they are attracted to it and want to drink it . The more water they drink , the healthier they are . Try it , your cats will love it too .	1
I 've found that almost all cats strongly prefer to drink running water as opposed to still water . Cat eyes are attracted to motion . My cats drink much more often from a fountain than a water dish which makes me feel better about their health . Cats love this thing , the only cons are from the human maintenance side of things.Cons : A water fountain is more work than filling up a dish . You must plug it in , turn it on , clean the pump , replace the filter , and refill the resevoir often . This does get annoying but is not a problem unqiue to this fountain , and to me it 's definitely worth it for my cats.The fountain is pleasant looking , a perfect size , and very quiet .	1
We bought two of these fountains -- this one and the `` planet blue , '' after our vet recommended getting an automatic fountain for one of our cats who is in the early stages of having urinary tract problems . We found out that cats usually do n't drink as much as they need to , and this can lead to crystals in their urine , blockages and severe health problems including organ failure . Our vet also told us that cats drink less out of traditional bowls because their whiskers tend to hit the sides which is uncomfortable for them . The bowl of this fountain is wide enough to accommodate whiskers and therefore cats will tend to drink longer . After a day or so of being timid of the fountain , our cats took right to it . They are drinking probably four times the amount of water they used to drink from regular water bowls . The water trickling does make some noise , just enough to entice the cats and be soothing to nearby humans . It is so much easier to deal with than changing water in bowls twice a day ; when the water gets low you simply pop out the reservoir and refill it . The water stays cleaner because of the filter . This is a great product and highly recommended to help prevent and manage urinary tract issues that can be aggravated by not drinking enough water . This fountain was recommended to us by my mom who has owned one for several months with no problems .	1
I 've had two of these fountains , and several family members also have them . Yes , weird things happen , and at least one was returned to company with pump problems . For whatever reason , they do not include the following information routinely in their packaging . For a pdf that illustrates routine cleaning , and some FAQ 's , go to : [ ... ] You need to take the pump apart and despite the instructions in pdf , use the pointed type q-tips , a wire cake tester , in-between-teeth cleaner brush ( really ) , you get the idea , to clean it inside and out ! My cats love this fountain , but we joke that one of them has a `` drinking problem , '' because she likes to belly-up at front of fountain and drink from waterfall , resulting in a drenched bib . The pdf should address many of the common complaints about this product . Good luck !	1
I bought a bubbler water thing for my cats for the bedroom , but the bubbler was way too noisy so I long ago ditched the bubbling parts . I 've been wanting to get a fountain in there , but wanted something quiet . I thought this Petmate fountain would be quiet since the water does n't drop far from the spout and I was right . The only sound I hear on the level it 's on now is a low hum from the motor that is no bother at all . The cats are used to the Drinkwell fountain in the livingroom . It took them just a few minutes to check out the Petmate and now they seem to drink out of it more than the silent bubbler thing . My only wish is that I 'd have bought the large or jumbo size for a bigger dish and reservoir . With 5 cats I have to fill the little reservoir bottle up every night .	1
I bought this for my older cats last year and they had no interest in it so I stopped using it . They are gone now and I have a new set of cats . They are fine with it and like how the water flows around . The item has worked fine for me but I do have to put water in it every morning . Easy to do , I just pour a paper cup full into the bowl . If I do n't it makes a lot of noise , quiet when full . Still I like it and do n't worry about it very much . Clean it about every month and that is fine .	1
Ok this is great . It took a week or so for my animals to get used to the little bit of noise it makes . They all love it . Two cats and a dog . I love that they have fresh water and it 's big enough for 3 animals to use . We fill it up in the morning and it lasts all day . I went with the bigger one this time since there are 3 animals . I am very happy with this .	1
I wanted a cat fountain for a very long time . I researched many many different ones . Finally , after my cats come running whenever I have a glass of cold ice water ( they flip out for mine , and try to drink out of my glass every time ) , I found this one from Aspen Pet . It said that the water gets cool ... .. and what sold me on it is in the description . It said that dogs love cool water . That was all it took for me ! I wanted it ! . My cats ( who says that cats do n't like to drink water ? ? ? ? ) absolutely love it ! They get fresh , cold running water whenever they feel like it ( which is so often ) . I am so glad that I waited and got this one . I was so shameful for giving them tap water that I put in a milk jug ... . it would be warm to hot ( in the summer ) and stagnant . Here I was , drinking tap water with ice in it . They still want to drink mine , but not quite as often . This is a quality product which is very well built and will withstand the test of time . You do n't need to buy those expensive ones that do n't even keep the water cool . This one will outlast most of them .	1
I 've been using Petmate water fountains for a few years now , tending to get a couple of years of use out of them . For the price , the amount of use ( two cats ) and hair I 'm usually cleaning out of the pump , it seems reasonable to me . I bought the latest one recently and was pleased to see they 've included a screen in front of the pump that is catching a lot of the hair before it gets to the pump.This has a nice water flow , is usually quiet ( unless there 's a clog or water is pouring out of the resevoir ) and the cats have no problem drinking from it . Those are its pros , along with its price ( much better than the version that the vet pushes ) . However , I 've noticed that this unit is more difficult to put back together after taking it apart for cleaning , which cost it a star ( not sure if it 'll get easier over time but am certainly hoping so ) .	1
I bought this for my 6 cats and the holding tank is too small . I kept this but bought a different fountain . Once some of our rescues pass we will go back to this one .	1
My cat thinks this fountain is fantastic , which is what really matters . I 'm sure she 'd give it five stars , but she 's not the one who has to clean it . There are a few areas that are hard to reach with a sponge , so I bought a baby bottle cleaner which does help in reaching some of the places I just ca n't fit my hand . The mineral deposits get pretty gross on the ramp the water flows down , so you do need to scrub the fountain fairly frequently . Overall , it 's a good product that 's designed so the cat ca n't tip it over . I do wish I 'd bought a larger size ( I have the medium ) because I have to refill it often . As it starts to need water , it makes a loud swishing noise that turns into a horrific sucking sound when it gets really low .	1
One of the things responsible cat owners have to do is to make sure their felines are drinking enough , especially true if your kitties are on a dry-food diet . This can be a challenge since cats can be notoriously finicky or even lazy about drinking enough water.With this in mind , as well as keeping more water available during my frequent travels , I tried out this unit , was pleased , and bought an additional one . After about a year , one of them started to leak through the joint whre the water flows through . I replaced the unit with a new one that has not leaked yet.I 've had three cats use them . One loves the water fountains best and drinks from them pretty much exclusively ; that senior kitty ca n't crouch very well so she drinks from the top of the flowing part , while standing up . Another cat alternates between normal bowls and the bowl of the fountains . A third one never used the fountains.For the people complaining about noise or burned out units , keep in mind this product uses a submersible pump ( like in an aquarium ) , it needs to be completely immersed to function properly and to cool itself . Letting it run dry makes it both noisy and damages the pump ( after a while ) . Keep it filled and it 's fine . The fountain will be noisy for 1-5 minutes when you first re-fill it , but otherwise it 's just a quiet hum.Caveats : It 's hard to tell when the filters are gunked up enough to affect the taste of the water , and replacing them creates some added cost . If your animals shed a lot , fur can get stuck around the pump and eventually impede water flow . My cats prefer if I change the water in the fountain regularly ( much more often than Petmate suggests ) .Other thoughts : I checked with myP3 International P4400 Kill A Watt Electricity Usage Monitorand discovered the unit only uses a miniscule 2W , less than most nightlights ! For the price and the health of your animals , these are a bargain . Recommended !	1
My cat loves this , as she is very fussy when it comes to her water . About a year ago , she had several crystals removed and the vet advised us to do whatever we could to make sure she was getting enough water , so I bought the Fresh Flow , which has been wonderful for her . She loves it so much that when it is time for routine cleaning of it , she meows at me the entire time I am working on it until she has her FreshFlow back . I do not use this as a water filter though , as I have filtered water from my tap.Keep in mind that routine cleaning is necessary to keep the FreshFlow working . Fur from the cat will clog the pump/motor , which will eventually burn out if not attended to . I clean this out once per week to ensure it works properly . I believe parts of this product is dishwasher safe , but unfortunately , I do not have a dishwasher , so I am forced to wash the entire unit by hand , which takes me 15-20 minutes . When cleaning , it is important to clean the pump and ensure it is free from pet hair . I even take a cotton swab to get into deep areas that are impossible otherwise to clean.This is a 5-star product for those who are good with keeping up on regular maintenance . For those who are not good about maintenance , I would pass on this for daily use , but still look into it as something to use when leaving your pet alone for a few days . I own the jumbo size and that can store water for up to 2 weeks for my single cat .	1
I was concerned from other reviews that it might be too noisy-after the pump fills and starts the waterfall , it is very quiet , almost inaudible . All of my cats love drinking out of it . I clean it weekly , which admittedly is n't as easy as cleaning a plain water bowl , but I think it 's worth the extra 10 minutes . It 's funny as now they wait for me to put the fountain back vs. drinking out of a plain bowl . I use the filtered water from my refrigerator and the charcoal filters that came w/ it . The customer service from Entirely [ ... ] was wonderful and this item arrived in a few days . I now shop directly at their web store since they carry CNET dental cat chews that really clean their teeth-Greenies get gobbled too quickly w/o any dental effect .	1
I also have a drinkwell fountain that my cats are used to , so I needed something similar to set up a second location . the cats love it ! it was easy to set up and it 's very quiet .	1
Very quiet , easy to clean and maintain . My cats love having fresh filtered running water to drink !	1
Our cat has hydration problems which lead to bowel movement problems , but she loves the running water that this fountain provides and it greatly reduces her bowel movement issues . Highly recommend especially if your cat loves drinking out of faucets and whatnot .	1
Was in between machines and my pets would not drink out of their bowls . Once I received the new machine they have not stopped drinking . I absolutely love it . I 've had 2 of them and they all lasted a very long time 5+ years without a problem . I highly recommend . It beats filling bowls all day long .	1
The first two days this fountain worked great . Both my cat and I were very happy with it . On day 3 the pump started making strange noises . I checked the troubleshooting and pulled it apart to make sure the pump was not what was rattling . ( It was n't ) Also the unit seemed to be leaking water out of the middle where it is attached . Right now ... the pump is out and my cat is once again having to deal with standing water only . So much for this solving that problem.I bought another one of these and the problems with the first one were gone . I must have gotten a lemon the first time . The pump on the new one is quiet . Now if my cat was n't so suspicious of the flowing water , my life would be easier . I updated my rating from 2 stars to 5 stars .	1
This is my 2nd/3rd petmate fountain . My 1st one was the blue ( discontinued color ) medium size 50 oz . It worked wonderfully . It was quiet , unless it needed to be refilled . It never leaked and my cat preferred it over the bowl . She would always drink out of the running faucet . I had to fill it every week or so . The pump died twice , might have been my fault for not refilling the bowl as fast as I should of . Overall I was very happy with it . It lasted a year . My only complaint was that there 'd be a sludge , or slime that would occur . Maybe from not cleaning it more often ? Also a lime build up ( I think thats what it 's called ) where this dry white stuff would occur on parts of it . People say you can clean it w/ vinegar , I tried but it was n't a huge success it does n't completely get rid of it and it comes back.So 2 weeks ago I needed a new pump and since the plastic was all nasty from the dryness on it , I splurged and got another . Plus I got a new kitten on top of it . I got the cream color medium size again . Now with two cats I was filling it up daily , and it leaked every time it was filled . Since I was returning it for faultiness . I ended up looking around for a larger size.I found this one , cream color 108 oz large size . I wanted to get the jumbo , just to not have to fill it that often , but I figure that would 've been more for a small dog instead . Overall I 'm very happy with the size I got , it 's twice the size of my old one and I 've notice no problems . I suspect it will have the same issues , but overall I 'd rather have it then a bowl . Just a note , try and not keep the food bowl next to it too close . If you 're like my cats and they spill into the bowl and then it just makes you clean it more.I wish that they would make an all stainless steal model . I think my cons would n't be there anymore if they did . And I would n't even mind paying a lot more for it . I think the price is well for what it is . And filters are n't too expensive .	1
I have two cats , one was a little scared at first , but the other one took right to it and will even lay beside it on occassion when it is hot . Now they both love it , when I first set it up , it did make a sound , but after a week when I went to clean it , I realized that is makes that sound if it is not completely full . Now the loud sound that others complain about is gone , you have to make sure that not just the reserve part of the fountain is full but also the main container level matches water level as well . Cleaning it once a week is best , since fur can get caught as well as food bits in the main fountain . But it is a really good fountain , it was so good that I got one for my moms new kitten !	1
I was happy at first with this product . In the second month this product failed . It over flowed while I was gone and ruined my hard wood floor . This product does n't work well with hard water so if you have soft water then it is a good product but if you are like 90 % of people and you have hard water , this product do n't last . Total waste of money ! Also it is hard to keep clean the cat slime gets bad within 2 days .	1
It works great , easy to clean and our cats love it . We have 6 cats and it lasts a day and then we change it so they are really happy about fresh water everyday . It keeps the hair out of the pump really well with a little cover that is REALLY nice . We had the largest one thinking with so many cats we would need it but it got dirty faster and they were not happy so we switched and it was the best thing we could have done.I have learned a little trick to cleaning the pump easily Q-Tips . I have found the what I call pond scum that builds up in the pump and is nasty and hard to get out without a major effort ( it could be just me ) but I have found that if you run it under hot water for a few seconds and then use Q-Tips to clean the scum out it works REALLY well . You can get down around where the magnet sits in the center and all cracks and little spaces . Then I go and run it under the water again to make sure there is no cotton or left over scum and your done and put the pump back together .	1
It 's smaller than I thought it 'd be but quality is fine . The edges of the plastic are smooth and it does not have any icky plastic smell .	1
There is n't too much that one can say about a cat litter box , except that it is exactly what I expected . Good quality and not flimsy .	1
I use these in my rabbit 's pen . I line them with an absorbent pad and then pile in hay . He does his business in them and I dump the contents and rinse them . They have held up better than any other litter pans I have bought . I 've had them for a month and they still look brand new after I rinse them out . Very nice pans	1
I have a kitty that has a hard time with her back legs and sometimes ca n't get over the other boxes which are higher . She can get in and out of this one being low with no problems . I also only have to use a little of the cat litter so there is no mess over the sides either , clumps with no dust through Amazon .	1
I used this for my five stray foster kittens that I found in my back yard . It was perfect for them ! And the price is unbeatable . I do n't know if it 's because it 's a brand new box or what , but the smooth plastic on this made cleaning the box super easy . There was no scraping or struggling to get clumps to release off the bottom . I think it would be a little too small for a full grown cat , but it 's wonderful for kittens .	1
This is a nice large size litter box . Needed a bigger liter box for my cat because she kept flinging the litter out when she coveredher business and this one she ca n't do that as easy as the other one I had . Very nice sturdy box as well	1
This is an excellent product , but be sure to check the dimensions well , before ordering . I eye-balled the dimensions and ended up with a box that was too big for my cat . No problem , as I gave it away to a friend , but just a friendly suggestion for future buyers - check the size !	1
My cat loves her giant litter box and fills it up with giant surprises for me daily . She loves to hide presents for me deep inside it . But seriously larger pan means less on the floor . very little litter gets kicked .	1
Heavy and so nice to have a clean one ! My cat loves it too . I use the plastic bag inserts which also came from Amazon , and I just pick up the bag full and toss it , never touch it with my hands .	1
My cats have been eating this brand for years . They never tire of it and I like the ease and lack of odor .	1
all my cats seem to like the food and seems to stop urinary tract infections with that being said it seems like a great cat food	1
My cats love this food so much that I have it as a subscribe and save auto-delivery . Product arrives as promised and I do n't have to worry about running out !	1
I have been feeding my kitties premium cat food all of their lives and have had one kitty who has experienced two urinary blockages ( despite the good food ) .Kitty has been stable on the Royal Canins urinary s/o dietRoyal Canin Veterinary Diet Feline Urinary SO Moderate Calorie Dry Cat Food 3.3 lb bagbut I have found that the price has just increased so much and the ingredient list was nothing like what I have fed them in the past . The RC has made my cats gain more weight ... I decided to explore the OTC Purina product - pro plan - and after researching I found that this seems like a good substitute for the dry part of their diet . The royal Canins canned food just became a total turn off to the cats and they all avoid it and I have found that there is a lot of waste . The main thing to get my cats to do is drink more water . I keep many fresh water sources around the house and they seem to be drinking and urinating fine.This kibbles from the Pro Plan look almost identical to the royal Canins and the cats seem to tolerate it and eat it . I 'm saving about $ 25 a bag on this . So far so good .	1
My female kitty had an UTI and the vet ordered her the VET-only supplied UTI food at a very high price . She did n't eat it at all , neither the dry nor the wet kind.So I bought some of this Pro Plan UT Focus formula . She eats it - not exactly with great pleasure - but she eats it and since weeks we had no more problems . As mentioned by many other customers , the & # 34 ; cheaper & # 34 ; food is as good as the one that the vet tries to sell with a big profit . I recommend it anytime .	1
I purchased 4 bags of weight management food for four very lazy , old and fat cats ... and i put 1/2 cup of each food in a bowl and left it out for a couple of hours ... this was the food they all devoured first . It 's not scientific , but everyone likes it and when we have to use one of the other foods ( ie empty cupboard ) they complain !	1
I purchased the Purina Pro Plan Sensitive Skin and Stomach Formula as two of my five cats have very dry skin above the tail . I knew they needed extra omega vitamins as I 've been feeding them the Hiarball Conrol Formula . This is made with lamb as the first ingredient . I do n't think I 've ever seen the five of them eat dry food up so quickly ! It seems that I 'm always refilling their bowls . The dry skin seems to be better after 2-3 weeks of eating this formula . One of the cats still is some flaking , but it is much better . Perhaps it takes awhile to completely go away.I received this very quickly as always .	1
As stated in other reviews , I always feed my cats ProPlan . They have excellent varieties that keep mykitties happy & contented ... ..salmon is one of their fav 's ! Proplan products are excellent quality , highly recommended by my Vet and give my kitties great teeth , beautiful shinny coats with no stomach problems.Delivery is prompt and w/o problems .	1
Due to work , I had cats in South Africa for two months before they were transported to Venezuela . I was afraid they would n't like the new food or get sick , since I did n't have the food they were used to previously.Both cats took to the food quickly and really enjoy it . No tummy issues , but I do always recommend that if you are switching food , do so by adding a little more of the ProPlan and less of their previous food during a week 's time.I am happy becuase I know they are eating healthy . As a treat , I also give them wet food once a day . Dry food is there all day .	1
I dont care what the vet said he/she also say nothing of the side affect when giving your pet shots and whenever you ask a question it should take 3 minutes to answer but they are busy and only say a few seconds worth UTI 's arent cause by a food but ingredient cats NEED water but not water from a bowl cats in the wild get water from meats they eat so they dont drink much causing stress on organs especially on the bladder a kidneys so I feed cut up raw chicken breast very small every 2 days and also feed wet every other day and you MUST have a grain free food to fully stop organ and body problems such as infections pains joints anything even shedding yes shedding is controlled by food so get a good food you can afford yet your cat can live and not survive on vet only get a few hours of nutrition classes provided by Science Diet so dont ask them about brands go research and look even Newman owns is good so id evolve to name a few local store brands	1
Our cat was having some problems with urinary tract infections . This dry formula plus the Pro Plan canned formula for Urinary Tract Health seemed to get her completely cleared up .	1
I used this in my automatic feeder instead of the overpriced science diet CD from the vet . I use friskies special diet cans normally , since wet food is much better for UTIs , but this dry is ok when we go away for a few days . More meat than Purinas cheaper urinary food .	1
After our cat developed UT crystals we were told we would have to change her food . We tried this Proplan and subsequent visits revealed it had done the trick . No expensive specialized food - just switched from `` Hairball Care '' to `` Urinary Care '' . Delivery was VERY fast .	1
One of my cats was having issues with UTIs . After numerous vet visits due to recurring UTIs I decided to give Purina Pro Plan Urinary Tract Health a try since my cat refused to eat the prescription food the vet recommended . To my surprise , she did n't have any issues eating this brand ( she 's quite a picky eater ) and it cured her UTI . This was about a year ago and she has n't had another UTI since ! Although it 's dry food , it 's not dry like typically brands . It 's more moist which is what you want to help with UTIs . It does n't seem to have any effect on my other cat who does n't have any issues with UTIs which means that I do n't have to try to feed them different food .	1
My cat had a urinary obstruction blockage about a year ago . After a huge vet bill and a long hospital stay , I was determined not to have him ( or me ! ) ever go through that again . I immediately put him on the very expensive prescription food , Royal Canin Urinary S/O . For a few months he liked it , but then got sick again . He gained a lot of weight and was becoming matted . He is a long haired cat but was never matted before . He began to vomit multiple times during the day and was drinking excessive amounts of water . After a visit to the vet and more bloodwork , it was determined that he just did n't like the food anymore . I have another cat , perfectly healthy , that has to eat the same prescription food too so there is equality , and I needed a cheaper alternative . My vet gave us the go ahead to try this food instead . Within the first few days of switching , my cat seemed happier , was n't drinking as much , and my bank account did n't hurt as bad . My cat does not vomit now and has lost weight . My other cat seems pleased with the switch as well . I love the Purina brand and Pro Plan is the only brand I feed my pets .	1
I wo n't feed my cats just anything . This is a high quality food that they love to eat . Helps minimize hair balls . I 've even noticed that the poop in the litter box is smaller and less stinky ! : )	1
My 13-year-old Persian thinks this stuff is pretty good . He has that disease , Lymphocytic-Plasmacytic Gingivitis Stomatitis , which means he had to have all of his teeth removed since they attack his body , but does n't have any trouble getting these down . He usually eats mostly wet food but he enjoys this dry food quite a bit . Plus , he does n't toss up his lunch anymore since buying these which , in my opinion , is the best part . The price is fair here on amazon too - it 's higher in the local stores here in Ohio . Recommend !	1
I have an 8 year old cat from a shelter ( had her since she was 2 years old ) she has allergies which made her eyes crusty ( probably the reason she was in a shelter ) I spent hundreds of dollars on vets , got medications and prescription food , but this is what work for her.. also very tasty , unlike the prescription food that was 3x the price .	1
The rating is actually what my 4 cats think of this food . They adore it so therefore I adore it .	1
Good food . Cats ate well and did not cause my cat to be sick like the other food did .	1
My cat has a terrible time getting rid of hairballs and will not eat products sold in tubes . He gets terrified and runs like a maniac screaming when he knows expelling of hairball by mouth is coming . This product has helped in getting rid of hairballs more frequently so I do not have to worry about his whole body being filled with them . I have not found this particular type available in local stores .	1
Been buying Pro Plan Sensitive Skin and Stomach for the past few years . Recommend it for cats who barf up their dry food .	1
This is probably the 8th cat food I have tired to help with my cats ' dandruff . It has helped tremendously and the cats seem to like it . The price is pretty good compared to other cat foods for skin and coat that did n't help with the flakes .	1
just received it and opened it immediately She sniffed it and began eating it . did not eat a lot but she was already full . If I had waited I most likely would have given 5 stars . but I wanted to do this before I forget about it . I 'll give the benefit of the doubt since she does sniff and walk away . FIVE ***** STARS ! ! ! ! ! !	1
My male adult cat has had a sensitive stomach for a couple of years now , and I was using a different brand that raised their prices so I tried out this one . He 's been using this food for over a year and never throws-up on it.He loves it and it 's working well with his tummy ! 5-stars in my book !	1
I really appreciate that the ingredients are better than most without it being too expensive ! My cats do n't LOVE it as much as another brand we use , but this is cheaper and they are fine eating it .	1
My cats really enjoy this food and it 's good for them . I alternate it with other wet food such as Friskees and it keeps them satisfied . However , even though the Canidae Company insists that Life Stages for Cats is just a rebranding of Felidae , there is something different about it because a few of my cats which ate Felidae will not eat Life Stages . Something to keep in mind if you have been using Felidae . Overall , I highly recommend this food .	1
Excellent food , super ingredients ! This is the stuff cats are SUPPOSED to eat , folks.Unlike the other reviewer , my cats absolutely love it .	1
I had originally ordered this for the cranberries and eggs for my 8 year old cat , but , we had to put her to sleep about 4 days after it got here . She went into acute renal failure . We miss her . My 15 yr old male cat like it though and since he has no back teeth it 's still perfect .	1
would highly recommend this and other canidae/felidae products for a more nutritious meal for your pet , my cat absolutely loved it !	1
I fed this food during the hottest days of summer , as it has a lot of moisture to it . I prefer to feed dry food , but every other or every third day I have been feeding Felidae . During the hottest weeks one can was all I needed for four cats . A fourth of a can filled them up at once , though sometimes they came back a couple hours later and finished the portion . I feed under , and to the side of the air conditioner to keep the food fresher during the hottest days.Then they also have a pan of dry food in the bedroom , and another in the kitchen.I feel very confident with Felidae because of it being made in the United States.I have rinsed out the can and poured some of the water in with the food . Big mistake , they wo n't eat it . They wo n't eat it with anything mixed in it , i.e . pieces of cooked chicken.Straight from the can they seem to really like both flavors I have been buying .	1
They do n't like this every day , every meal , but if I rotate it so its only on the plate every few days , they adore it . It is so good for them , and as big lazy mature Maine Coon cats ( 3 of them ) they need a high dry-matter protein food with very few carbs/fillers . Very happy with Canidae so far . We rotate between this and Wellness , Max Cat , and Evanger 's .	1
I have several cats , so a litter that clumps quickly and well is really important . This litter did really well in those areas . The one area that I was n't crazy about , but the cats did n't seem to mind , is the scent . It was borderline unpleasant , I wish this litter came in an unscented form with just baking soda in it .	1
What can I say ? It 's clumping cat litter . It does exactly what it is supposed to and the cats do n't run from it howling . This is not my favorite brand , but that just speaks to my preferences and not the quality of the litter . If you need litter delivered , this is a good choice .	1
My house is a mult-cat household and I do n't want it smelling like a cat box . With the Super Scoop I and my guests can enjoy my cats without smelling the box.While all clumping litters clump , some better than others , not all are suitable for use in an automatic , self-cleaning litter box . The Super Scoop excells at this . It clumps firmly and stays hard so the automatic box can do its work . It also absorbs nearly all of the odor so the cat box can been seen before it can be smelt . I 've used this product in a prior LitterMaid unit and now in myPetSafe Simply Clean Continuous-Clean Litter Box . The Super Scoop has worked flawlessly in those applications.When I adopted a new cat recently , I set up a seperate little box until she could be accustomed to my house and other pets . It was the low-tech variety needing to be scooped on a regular basis . Once again the Super Scoop made the clumps easy to remove and the cat box itself was nearly odorless.The Arm and Hammer Super Scoop is now my preferred brand .	1
I rated this product as I did because it may have a little dust but not near as much as others I have used ... The price is right on this product being it is delivered in 2 days to my door ... I choose the 14 lb box as my litter box is upstairs and it 's a pain to haul the bigger boxes up the steps ... One other thing I find the smaller box good for is storing the used litter until I fill the box ... . I can then carry the used litter downstairs to dispose ... . I wash the litter box a couple times a month and 14 lbs fill it nicely ... My cats are not picky about scented or unscented and I have used both with good results ...	1
Smells good ( as far as a litter box can ) clumps well , cats like it and it does the job . Just clean box daily	1
This is our litter of choice . There is no problem with odors and minimal tracking . Now I can get it for the same price as at the store , but with Amazon delivering it , AND I can use my Amazon Prime account ( normally shipping costs for heavy litter make buying it online ridiculous ) . The 14-pound box size is perfect to fill the litter box one time so I do not have to store a half-used container of opened litter .	1
By far her favorite toy since we received it 2 weeks ago . Have not noticed any of the potentially & # 34 ; dangerous & # 34 ; breakage noted by others and Jackie is a strong Pitbull with a serious love of chewing .	1
My dog is a huge fan of toys and I guess one with bacon flavor makes it even more attractive ! Rawhide makes him very sick but my dog loves this bone while he wo n't sit with it for hours he does chew on it regularly . I definitely saw an improvement on the amount of tarter build up . I give him a dentastix and still brush but this is a nice help to lessen the burden .	1
This is a great chew toy and it keeps my chewer busy , but I 'm not sure it will actually clean her teeth since she only chews on one side .	1
These are the only nylon bones that can stand up to my pitbulls ' strong jaws . They 're even more durable than Nylabones , and cheaper , too ! They last the longest but I still replace them after a 3-4 weeks . The Nylabones I have to replace in a week , and I get the super durable ones . Every dog that comes over goes right for them , even my mother 's 9-year-old golden retriever who never liked bones .	1
2 of my dogs love them . I have an english bulldog and scottish terrier that are superchewers and these toys seem to last and are very reasonable priced.No toys last forever , I throw toys away if they have gotten too smallbut we have several of these in different shapes and sizes and the dogs chew on themevery day . My mini dachshund is n't fond of them as he likes softer toys .	1
A lovely little lady I was helping sponser received this and multiple other gifts . As far as I know she is loving each and every piece !	1
This large bone is great medium to large breed not oversize and is quite sturdy ! They can be found for an excellent price I have ordered a couple and will continue to do so !	1
Do watch the little plastic nubs that get chewed off rather quickly . Probably digested easily , but I pull them off when I can . My golden is a good chewer and these ( both sizes ) are among his favorites .	1
I 've tried a million different shapes and size nylabone . My dog does not care about them at all . This is the only chew toy that he actually chews on . I do n't know why he likes it so much but he does !	1
I knew that this chew would have a smell to it , but it is powerful . My German Shepherd has now had this chew for a few weeks and the smell is starting to relax . I love the smell of bacon , but fake bacon stinks .	1
I have 7 hard nylon bones for my pair of 3 month old dogs . This one is the first one they go for , every time . So , I guess it serves its purpose very well . Getting in between my dogs teeth and my furniture . I will be getting another one for the crate . Also , even though my dogs are smallish , about 10 pounds , they still prefer this over the smaller nylon bones . They seem particularly interested in picking at the rubbery insert .	1
my dog adores these - they are very expensive in stores so consider getting them online . i think because of the flavouring , most dogs would enjoy them	1
My two American bulldogs love Nylabones . I have to buy them dura chew items because they just shred all others . However , i wanted to give them more variety so i gave this a try . It 's slightly cheaper , but just as durable. , the shape is n't as unique as some of the Nylabones , but the dogs do n't seem to lose interest. , perhaps it 's the unique flavor ? They like the texture , shape , and taste of this item a lot .	1
This toy gets chewed on almost daily and is still in great condition , my pup usually destroys things , but this one is still going strong ! I would recommend .	1
My dog destroys most toys we bring home for her , but this was perfect . She 's had it for several weeks now and it still has a lot of life left .	1
My dogs love this item they never get tired of chewing and this keeps them busy for days . I would recommend this if you have aggressive chewers .	1
Dogs like this bone and it also lasts for a very long time . We have a puppy that chews on everything in site & this has helped a lot !	1
My Puppy LOVES these bones and they are wonderful chew bones that keep her content for a long period of time . They also help to calm her down and she seems to relax while she 's chewing . It 's also great to keep her from chewing on things around the house ! Very pleased and will buy again !	1
They never seem to lose their bacon smell so my dogs never loose interest in them . They are also very durable , although I have small dogs , so I ca n't speak to how they would do with a lab or a pit bull . My sister has a pit bull mix though and he likes the big ones and goes through them pretty slowly compared to other bones .	1
My dogs chew through everything ... except this ! I have been quite pleased thus far as this bone is still in tact and the dogs seem to love it .	1
It is hard for me to find items that my dogs can't\wont chew up quickly . I have 2 yellow labs and they seem to be able to destroy just about every chew toy I 've ever tried . So far this one has lasted , they still have chewed down the end plastic parts on some but all things considered it 's working well .	1
I got this in the mail today , sent using Amazon prime . It got here in less than 48 hours so that aspect was great.I purchased this for my dog after my friend 's dog stayed for the weekend and my dog ended up loving his smaller version of this chew toy ( she shredded the ends of it ) . So far my dog really likes this . She is a 35lb terrier/beagle/pit bull mutt who can destroy one of the medium sized nyla bones in a month , so I thought I 'd give it a try . I will amend the review if I have any problems later , but so far it 's great : ) After about an hour of chewing today , she already did shred one end of it a bit ( more than she is able to do in an hour on a new nyla bone ) but I 'm sure it will provide her plenty of use before it 's destroyed . 5/5 so far	1
I have two corgis that love to chew - blankets , shoes , sharpies , and these ... My dogs kill most plush toys in ten minutes or less , in fact I am resound to the fact that they may do it to drive me crazy . Anyway , these bones last at two to three months and a four dollars less here on Amazon than in PetSmart .	1
I have a blue brindle Cane Corso who is allergic to a lot of things . He ca n't eat most dog foods , ca n't chew on rawhides or cow hooves , and does n't like Nylabones . It 's been a real challenge to find something that he can chew on that he both likes and that wo n't disintegrate in a short period of time . This Hartz bone does the trick.Give my dog a large cardboard box to tear apart and you 'd think that he 'd gone to Heaven . Unfortunately he tends to eat small pieces of it and he really knows how to turn a large box into a million little pieces . He loves his Hartz bone . Whenever he goes over to his toy basket and roots around for something to play with , the Hartz bone is often his first choice . He is capable of breaking it apart over time , so it pays to keep an eye on it to make sure that he does n't start eating pieces . They 're cheap enough , just buy another one whenever you start to get concerned .	1
My dog did n't destroy it but lost interest in it and does n't play with it for any period of time .	1
I have 3 large dogs all over 80 lbs and one 20 lb Rat Terrier mix mutt . The product is great but $ 8 , bad price ! I can buy for $ 5 at Walmart .	1
I got this for my dutch shepard and he loves it . It has held up well with no missing pieces at all .	1
My dog loves this bone , she is seventy pounds , and it a chewer ! ! It has been about two months now since we have had this , and it is wearing down on the ends , buy very durable . I would highly suggest this product , and will purchase again .	1
Durable bone . My mastador pup has n't destroyed it yet . Does not have a strong or nasty scent . This is not her favorite bone but when I give it to her she 'll lay there with it and will get into her happy chewing zone . When this one gets worn out I 'd buy another .	1
My pets love their snuggle mate . I bought mine about 7 years ago and it is still going strong . My cats love to snuggle with it . I am now looking to purchase one for our dog 's crate ( for in the car ) . For the people who have had problems with theirs ... you really must be more careful with the wattage your microwave puts out . If not , it appears that people have warped theirs , started fires and other problems . One must really use products safely in order for them to be safe for their home and pets . I would highly recommend this product to anyone who needs a safe pet warmer without wires and that is virtually chew proof . We will find out if it is actually chew proof once our 6 month old puppy gets one for Christmas : - )	1
these keep our cats warm at night in our unheated addition . Two paws up ! would be the review from the cats .	1
Helps keep my dogs warm while I am away at work . Their crate is inside , but the floors are cold . Do n't have to worry about something plugged in .	1
These plastic pads heat up well and retain their warmth for the promised time even in really cold weather . They are so much safer than anything electric and the cats love them . So glad that Amazon has sellers to supply us with such a great product .	1
I use this for my small dog who gets cold in the car if i have to leave him for a few minutes and at night in his bed . It stays warm for a surprisingly long time .	1
Heat the pad and put it into a dog bed . On a cold day , put it in a dog bed and put that on the porch so the dog can hop in for a quick warm up between explorations .	1
I have about 8 of these disks . Heating them for 7 1/2 to 8 minutes in my microwave is enough to get it pretty hot . I heat them hot enough so that I have to use a oven mit to get them out . I put them under the pads of my cats ' beds . I have several different types of beds . Some do not have removable pads , so I put the disk under the whole bed . It still gets hot enough to warm up the bottom of the bed . All my cats love the heated beds and they even know when I 'm changing the cold disks to warmer disks and will hop in as soon as I change them.In addition , I have a feral cat house outside of my door . It is very padded and has hay inside , but I put a folded towel in over the hay , with a heated disk under the towl and the feral kitty loves it . She has been staying in there every night and was even in there when I went home at lunch today . It is not freezing today but she must like the heated box because she did n't even try to run away like she usually does when I walked toward the door.For those having problems with the disk getting too hot or not hot enough , you need to check the wattage on your microwave . You may be leaving it in too long or not long enough for your particular watage . One morning , I was bleary eyed and did n't turn the light on when I started heating a disk . I accidentally set the timer for far too long , however the disk did not catch on fire ( as one reveiw said ) . It just melted and some liquid goo got all over my microwave . As I stated above , I have been putting the heated disks on top of hay in the feral cat houses and it has not caused a fire .	1
We have a family of feral strays that we care for . We bought Snuggle Safe to tuck into their outside bedding to keep them warm during freezes this past winter.I was skeptical.Following directions , then placing the heated disk underneath their blankets in their & # 34 ; cat house & # 34 ; , I was AMAZED to find that , 15 hours later , heat was still generating from it.We used this disk all winter and it still works great . The heat will last much longer if you make sure to wrap it in a towel or keep it insulated in some way , so that it emits a low heat all night through .	1
I 've had this for years , and it still works as well as it did the first time I used it . There 's not many products one can say that about ! Simple to use ( just microwave it for a few minutes ) and the heat output lasts for several hours outdoors ; about 12 or more hours indoors.One of my cats is arthritic , and this really helps her joints , especially in the colder months . While it does take more effort to prep than a plug-in cat bed , I feel that is more than offset by the fact that you 're not tied to an outlet ( can locate it anywhere ) plus I do n't have to worry about shorts or other electrical problems.I 've even used it myself a few times when I 've had sore muscles and needed some heat therapy.Highly recommend !	1
I bought this for an indoor cat that is always sitting on heat vents or under blankets , acting cold ( and we live in a fairly warm climate year-round ) . The vet has checked him for any disease-related process . He is probably just cold-natured like some people . Wrapped in removable , washable fleece case , this pad is a hard plastic round disc -- not soft that holds moderate heat for 8 - 10 hours . I suspect it is of hard material to prevent claws from puncturing it . I put it in the cat 's favorite place to sleep and over a period of attempts to get him to use it , he would sleep next to it ( not on it ) , or go somewhere else . The good thing about this disc is that it does not get very hot if you follow the directions . Exposure to even low heat over a protracted period of time can produce burns . This item would probably be most useful in a tiny enclosed space , e.g. , an indoor tent for cats or an outdoor cat house as it would hold the heat inside .	1
I have 2 guinea pigs so I got 2 of these for when I bath my piggies to help keep them warm . Wow do they work my piggies love them they stay heated for 10 hours just like the package says . With the easy removable cover it makes it easy when it needs to be washed . I highly recommend this product . I also use it for on cold days when my piggies can use a little extra heat .	1
I have used one of these for years and bought this one recently . The quality is the same . I am the caretaker for a spayed/neutered & vaccinated small feral cat colony . I heat these in the microwave one at a time before I take the cats ' water and warmed food out to them . The water goes on top of one disc and the food atop the other . In this cold weather , minus 10 to 20 degrees , these discs keep the food and water from freezing for about an hour , long enough for the cats to get there and eat and drink .	1
If you take care of a stray cat around your home , or an old animal with joint pains , I HIGHLY recommend this product ! Can be used indoor , or outdoor . Outdoor suggestions , under a blanket or fleece out of the rain . Stays warm for at least 8 hours depending on the weather.All you have to do is microwave it and put it back in it 's fleece pouch ! GREAT PRODUCT ! ! ! !	1
I was buying the disposable hand/body warmers to keep the outdoor cat 's bed warm ( he did n't like the new dog and stays out on the front porch in a small dog house ) , but the warmers almost doubled in price this year . I came upon the Snuggle Pad and it works great . It keeps the heat ( very warm ) for about 4-5 hours , but the pad stays warm for almost 10 hours . This is the best thing ever for my cat .	1
I bought this heating pad for my miniature dachshund who is always cold and loves to burrow under blankets . After heating the pad up for 6 minutes ( it comes with a sheet that tells you how long to heat depending on your microwave ) the pad stayed quite warm for at least 8 hours . My dog will snuggle up to it if I cover it up with blankets but by itself ( even with the fleece cover it comes with ) it is still pretty hard and apparently unappealing to her . I do wish the pad was a little softer so she would like it more but at least it is sturdy enough that she ca n't chew it up . The pad does come with its own fleece cover so do n't bother buying another one unless you want extra or if they make something thicker and softer to put it inside . If your dog or cat is not picky about what they snuggle up to this is a great item to keep their bed or kennel warm .	1
I bought one of these and was so pleased with it , I bought another one so I could use them in shifts . They hold the heat very well and keep my kitty 's bed warm for as much as 10-12 hours . I put it under a soft fleece blanket in his `` tent bed '' and he loves it .	1
Our bedroom is cold at night . I do not like getting into a cold bed . So this is perfect for me.It heats up in the microwave . No electric cords . I used to use an electric heating pad but this is much safer.It stays warm for an amazingly long time . It is also good to hold if I get a chill from being outside.My dog has never gotten to try it but I bet she would like it too .	1
I bought this for my Italian Greyhound puppy and I love it . I was nervous to get a plug in heater for his kennel for obvious reasons . With this product I just pop it in the microwave while I eat breakfast and get ready to leave the house , put it in my dog 's kennel and never worry about his safety , or how cold he is , while I 'm at work all day . It 's awesome !	1
My two rat terriers like the Snuggle Safe heating pad , though it 's hard to catch them in the act because if I 'm around , they snuggle with me , instead ! : - ) To my surprise , I like the Snuggle Safe quite a bit , too . If the dogs are n't using them , they work great as foot warmers !	1
My cat fell in love with this thing from the start ! Every time I heat it up for her , she stays wherever is it for long periods of time . She 's becoming quite the couch potato ! : - ) It does come with a cover and I always keep it on for her safety . I place it on the couch with a light blanket over it and she sleeps like a baby . I 've never seen her sleep so good ! Ca n't say enough great things about it !	1
While the plastic is kind of hard , the outer cover is nice and soft . It seems to stay warm during the night hours . We use it inside in a room that gets a little cold.UPDATE : November 2013I 'm still using this . I put it under one of my cat 's beds and the heat from beneath keeps her toasty at night . I 've checked in the morning and the thing is still putting out heat .	1
I live in Michigan , and it gets cold in the winter . I have 4 cats and 1 dog . One cat is older , thin , with thin fur so I thought I would try this out as I did n't want a plug in item . This particular cat sleeps in a cat bed on top of a bunk bed . At first I only heated it for 4 minutes and was n't impressed , then I found the wattage of my microwave ( 1000 watts ) and saw that it could go in for 5 minutes . That made quite a difference . It did come with a fleece cover , which I always leave on , but I still put it under some fleece wrap and my cat LOVES it . She always sleeps on it at night . During the day , if I remember , I will put it under a blanket on the couch and she and another cat will sleep on it . I tried it with my dog , but he was n't interested . I purchased a second one and have to admit that I stick it in bed with me . I often have to fight my daughter for it . Makes the sheets nice and warm.Now , if it is n't put under some type of cover , besides its fleece covering , it will cool much faster . And many times I have taken it out of the microwave and thought , this is n't hot , but as I 've had it in my bed with me , it can get painfully hot , so even if you think it is n't warm , it is still giving off a lot of heat.I ca n't be 100 % sure , but I would think a lot of the negative comments are people who did n't have it heated right , knowing the wattage of your microwave is important , and not having it covered to retain the heat longer.I want to get a third one , but winter is pretty much over , so I 'll wait till fall again .	1
My aunt suggested this product when I mentioned that I was thinking of getting a heated pet bed . Fortunately my cat Guy took to this right away . He 's an older boy , recently adopted from the Humane Society . He gets the shivers when he lays on our cold floors . It takes him forever to stop shivering , even when I hold him under a blanket . He can be nervous though -- I just bought him a cushy pet bed that he refuses to lay on . So I was worried he would n't like the disk , but honestly , it 's bringing him more bliss than catnip ! Another thing to note is that it does come with a cover -- I was n't sure that it did since the photo did n't show one .	1
I use Bed Buddys and put one on my 17 YO Border/Aussie mix since his hips hurt him a great deal . With this much colder than usual weather , I decided to give this a try when I noticed he was laying on the hard floor next to my oxygen concentrator , which puts out heat , but then his hip hurt so much he could n't get up.At first when I had him lie on his bed on the disc , he looked like 'I do n't want to lie here right now , I ... . OH Yeah , right there ! `` , a very contented look on his face . I put the heated disc on his giant bed in the morning so he can move to it or away from it as he wants to , and mostly he is using it . The disc is about 12 '' diameter and comes with a washable cover that is like a half circle you slide the disc in , and the top flaps close with Velcro . Also , the instructions say the disc can be heated with or without the cover , which sounds different than the way it used to be . I like to just keep the cover on , that way I do n't need any hot pads to remove it from the Micro . The package says it holds the heat for 10 hours , while the description of the product says 12 hours , however I 'm not sure how long it stays warm . As of now , I heated it this morning at 7 AM , it 's 2 PM now and it 's still warm . It would be nice if this company put out a flexible pet warmer as well , so I could drape the flexible one over the top hip , and he can lay on the disc on the bottom hip .	1
Works great for new puppies . Stays warm as it advertises . I would highly recommend this product to people who breed dogs .	1
do what it says , including letting it sit for a minute in the microwave , and it 's warm . i put it between layers because it is hard and smaller than the cats , and within a minute or two the warmth can be felt . a gentle warmth , not a big hit . i ca n't determine what my microwave power thing is ( timing is specific to the power ) so i experimented from the lowest upward .	1
We use these in our feral shelters to help keep the kitties warm in the winter . They stay warm all night when used in our unseated garage . We put them in the beds and under water bowls to keep them from freezing .	1
I love this and my Sphynx cats do too , but the big drawback is that it feels like a rock and does n't soften up . The cats would like it better if it were soft . Follow the instructions carefully-I was concerned that my Sphynx might get burned so I put an extra cover on it . Saying that , I want to emphasize that the warmer does not come out of the microwave hot-it comes out nice and warm and is able somehow to maintain that warmth for maybe 10 hours .	1
This pet warmer has been used several times since I received it , and it has worked like a charm . I warm it in the microwave and use it to keep the food warm for the outdoor cat that I feed . It also serves to keep her warm in the little enclosure I 've made for her . I highly recommend it .	1
I have been very happy with my Snuggle Safe heat pad . The claims of 10-12 hours of heat are true IF you insulate it a bit . OK , it cools off in 4 hours or so if you leave it sitting out , but under a blanket , it stays toasty for a good 10 hours ( I do n't think I have every checked it after 12 hours , but I expect it would still be a bit warm ) .Granted , my cats are not much interested ( maybe they will be when the weather gets cold again ) , but I love it . I stick it at the foot of the bed ( under the covers , so it stays warm ) , or even just hold it while I am reading in the evening . I also got one for my Mom , who has Reynaud 's Syndrome , and she says it is great . She just keeps it nearby and warms her hands as needed .	1
I bought the first one and the cat liked it . Do not over microwave , it will melt . The trick to having it last 8 hours is the pets bed.I am using this for a mini doxie , 5.5 lbs , I bought her a tunnel bed , and she wears a light sweater , with the snuggle in her bed she is not waking me up to put it inthe microwave at 3 am.Mini dogs have to be kept warm , they die fast . I micro this and put in her car crate when we travel around town .	1
I bought this for a feral cat I am taming . She is in a room that gets a bit chilly at night . It stays warm most of the night . There have been times when I come back in the morning that it is cold , but also times that it is still warm . The only thing that would make it completely perfect is if it were more flat and maybe softer . I put blankets around and over it to make it a little more comfortable . This is a great product !	1
I have been using these for my feral cat boys for several years now . They just will not come in the house ! So I put one of those plastic rain bubbles over my basement window well and cracked one side of it open enough for the two boys ( they are lifelong friends ) to get into the window well . I put a plastic bag on the ground of the window well , then a fleece blanket and then the snuggle safe heating pad . I put another thin fleece blanket over it , and a round pet bed over the top , so the boys are n't exposed to the hot pad.These pads work great . I love it when I feed the boys and then see them snuggled in the window well , grooming each other . There is nothing like a post-dinner grooming session in a heated window well ! Every winter night , I heat up a pad for 6 minutes in the microwave and then exchange it for the now-cold pad in the window well that I put there the night before . Very quick and simple . The pad does not get soft , but it definitely gets very warm . Do not handle the heated pad with your bare hands ; use a towel or the cover that comes with it . Never place it where the cat would be laying with the hot pad up against his skin ; always separate the pad from the cat with one or more blankets . BTW , I have started to not use the covers , because sometimes a little rain drips in the window well , and then I have a soggy pad cover to contend with , along with everything else that got damp.The pads stay warm for a long time . I have been surprised , on less-cold days , to go out there the next evening with the newly-heated pad and find yesterday 's pad still slightly warm . When it is very cold , that is not the case , but the heat definitely lasts for the overnight hours .	1
I love these pads . I have two of them and put them under my cats bedding . She was a stray who showed up a few months ago and I have three of my own who will not accept another cat in the house . So I have to keep the stray in the garage . It is starting to get cold here now and goes down to freezing . I bought her one of those HP Hunter insulated dog houses and moved it into the garage , put a nice little bed in it and I put the heating pads under her bedding . She stays nice and warm in that house and she loves it . The two pads also put heat out into the dog house . I am going to buy one more . Three would be just great cause colder weather is coming and the garage gets pretty cold even though the garage is insulated too.Highly recommend the heat pads instead of the electric heat pads . I just do n't trust the electric ones . Just put them in the microwave according to the watt of you micro . I put mine in for 6 minutes each pad . I do one at a time . Stays warn well into the morning . When I go out between 9-10:00 AM the next morning to let her out of the garage , the heat pads are still warm . I put them under her bed about 8:30PM every night . She is in the house with us for about 3-4 hours before I take her out to the garage . I just lock my three cats in the bedroom and let the stray in . Pads are wonderful . Just make sure that the pad is completely cold before reheating it ! Thanks	1
The SnuggleSafe heatpad only takes 4 minutes to warm up in the microwave and really stays warm for 12 hours . The only drawback is the hard surface of the pad - the dogs will lie up against it , but not on it .	1
I got the pad for my elderly dogs but have been using it for my cold feet in bed . It is heavenly . I ca n't believe how long it stays warm . Obviously I have to buy more for the dogs . Did n't they used to heat up bricks , wrap them up and stick them in beds on a cold night way back when ? This is a really great product . I know people who have multiple ones to use for their cats AND their own ailments .	1
We 've used these snugglesafe heating pads for years . But with two new dogs , it was time to get a couple more to make sure their dog beds were warm on a cold winter floor . I bought two more , plus extra covers , which you do n't need because it comes with a well-fitting plush cover . The blue plush covers I bought do n't fit well and in fact tore when I tried to put them over the heating pads . Some things to keep in mind when you purchase one of these : These are HARD . So it 's best if you forego the covers altogether , and simply place them under a few layers of blankets , or like I did- in a bed that is two parts ; the bottom part that sits on the floor , the second part is a pillow that fits securely into the bed . I put the snugglesafe between the pillow and the bottom of the bed , without the cover so it releases more heat up into the pillow they lay on . Because these are HARD , some animals will get freaked out by them , because it 's obvious that something is there , as in the review that told about the barn cat who would n't go near it . You need to do as I said above , put it under several layers of bedding so they do n't know it 's there , or purchase a two-part bed that leaves the heat pad safely ( and discreetly ) out of their area.These get VERY HOT . You need to make sure there are layers of protection between your pet and the snugglesafe . ( Again , as described above . ) But , they will stay warm for hours and hours , if not until the next day.They work GREAT and will last you for years as long as you do n't overheat them . Although they are pricey , they are a good solid investment to safely provide warmth to your pets .	1
I take in orphan kittens and am always on the go ! So this heating pad has been an absolute blessing ! ! Once heated up , it continues to release heat for 10-12 hours ! ! ! It has made bottle raising kittens so much easier ! !	1
We needed a way to keep our 5 pound Chihuahua warm all night , during our cold Pacific Northwest winters . He lays on it all night and sleeps well . I was surprised at how small and heavy it was , also it is hard plastic on the outside , I never thought the dog would cuddle on it.. but he did !	1
I used these on the brutal winter of 2013.They are great , I would wrap it in the cover and also put a little blanked on top . They last warm for around 8 hours , enough for them to have a good night sleep.I also had some electrical pads for the coldest nights , when it was under 30 degrees .	1
I bought this for my puppy , but used it myself first to test it out . It kept its heat all night . I was seriously impressed . It is hard , so I got a stuffed dog cover for it .	1
THIS PRODUCT REALLY DOES WHAT IT SAYS ! I bought this for my Airedale 's crate at night . I thought it would be nice to radiate a little heat ( during these chilly winter months ) under her top towel , and on top of her cushion and blanket . SHE LOVES IT , and has a hard time getting out of bed in the morning ! ! ! This disc is very hard , but she does n't seem to mind ( and I put it under a thick towel ) . It actually stays warm for about 8-10 hours , and I microwave only 5 mins and 15 secs , which is slightly under the recommended time for my microwave . HIGHLY RECOMMEND .	1
Our kitty loves this heatpad ! We heat the pad with its cover in our microwave for 5 minutes , according to the chart on the side of the headpad . Then we place it under the removable cusion in hercat bed , and it stays warm for about 10 hours.When we received the heatpad in the mail , I was suprised because it was so different from how I thought it would be ( but not in a bad way ! ) .- It 's made of thick , inflexible plastic . I thought it would be soft and rubbery , but I guess the hard plastic makes it `` bite resistant . '' No problems there.- I thought it would be about the size of a CD , but it 's almost as big as a frisbee ! Pleasant surprise -- more surface area for warmth.- It 's as heavy as a hardback cookbook.- It comes with a washable fleece velcro cover -- ours is tan with a black paw print design . You do n't have to buy a separate cover for it.I would recommend this heatpad to anyone looking for an alternative to the electric kind for their pet !	1
I am really liking this product after all . I was not sure it would stay warm for long , but it really does . I have not determined how long yet , but hours more than anything I have ever used . I put it outside under a blanket in a small house to keep a cat warm , and I think tonight was the first she was on it ! Even if the cat does not like it in the end ( I had an electric warmer before and she was afraid and would not go in the house ) I am keeping it to warm my bed before I get under the covers !	1
My out door Cat Free loader loves this snuggle safe heating Pad . It keeps her warm for hours.I put it in her out door cat Igloo . I think it works better than a pug in out door heating pad . She just came to my door one day and must have said this lady is going to take good care of me.And I do .	1
I got this for my sister who 's dog was expecting puppies just before Christmas . Where she lives it is really cold at night , well below freezing . This worked wonderfully to keep the newborn puppies warm . It 's about the size of a frisbee , but a bit heavier , and it really does keep everyone warm . The one we got came with a cover , and we bought an extra cover in case we needed to use it and wash the cover at the same time . Overall loved it .	1
Really has helped in the tough winter 's ( I have used a few years now ) . I use a cover but If you do n't use the felt cover , make sure you put it under a thin blanket/towel or something ( should n't have direct skin contact to the hard plastic ) . It 's very important that you microwave to the instructions . I have a 1,000 watt microwave which only requires 5 minutes . Works perfectly !	1
I bought these heating disks for the stray cat 's outside . They are wonderful we heat them at night and during the harsh winter day 's and they keep those poor animals outside warm .	1
I love SnuggleSafe ! It keeps my dog warm all night and it 's safe ! I do n't have to worry about electric wires or anything harming my pet . It saves energy since I only put it in the microwave for 5 minutes and it stays warm all night . I will get one for my sister 's dog and ferret next winter . I highly recommend it .	1
I love this heat pad . I use it for myself -- to warm up the foot of my bed , put it on my back or stomach if I have aches , put it under my feet if I 'm cold . It lets me save a lot of $ on heating bills because it 's so warm ! I love that it lasts for hours and hours -- unlike all the other microwave heat packs I 've tried .	1
This a nice safe alternative to falling asleep with an electric blanket , and it really does stay warm for hours . Wonderful as a 'people ' bedwarmer , and to place anywhere you get cold , your feet for instance . Looks like I 'll have to get another for my pets !	1
I purchased this item and an extra blue cover for an outdoor stray cat that has adopted me . Winters can be cold in Tennessee , even though this is a Maine Coon with lots of long fur . He has a styrofoam house lined with straw which will keep him warm and he currently uses it when the temperatures drop into the 50 's . I wanted added warmth for him on those colder nights and thought this was a great item . I 've heated the disk once just to see how long it remained warm . After heating , it 's just slightly warm to the touch with the cover on . I sat it on my coffee table and seven hours later , only the center of the disk remained warm . 30 minutes later , it was completely cool . Whether it retains the heat longer if the cat is actually laying on it , I do n't know yet . The cover that comes with the disk is very soft . The extra blue cover is soft , but smaller and it barely fits the disk . You will have to fight with it to get the disk inside and the cover does not completely close in the back . I do plan to order another SnuggleSafe so I can alternate them when the temperature drops close to freezing . So far , for the money , I 'm very pleased with the SnuggleSafe.This is an update . I 've now used it with the cat . It stays warm for well over 11 hours . I put it in a zip-lock bag to slip under the straw bedding ( the straw will stick to the fleece cover like velcro . It 's so much easier to clean the straw off of the bag -- I learned the hard way by just placing the SnuggleSafe under the straw ) . My second SnuggleSafe arrived . I 'm thrilled with this product and Big Bear loves it as well .	1
I bought 2 of these for my cats for Christmas . They are great and the cats just love them . It did not take them long to figure out that the disks are warm and they snuggled right up to them . My cats are indoor cats but I figure on the coldest days it is always nice to get some extra warmth . I also had to get one out before Christmas because I had a sick cat that needed to go to the vet . I fits perfect in the carrier and I did not need to worry that my sick cat was going to get chilled . I love the fact that there are no cords and the cover that comes with it is great also to keep a barrier between the cat and the disk . I would recommend this to anyone that wants to give their pet some extra warmth without cords . The disk stays warm for a good 12 hours so you only need to microwave it twice a day . Great idea and gread product !	1
We have a bunch of these on hand at all times . Over time , they will start to not hold heat as well , but it 's after tons of use . You ca n't beat the safety of this item . Our kittens love them . They hold enough heat to keep their body temps at the right level for proper function of their digestive systems . Our older cats love them too . Rescuers ... if you do n't have these ... you 're working too hard !	1
Only issue is plastic starts to break down after repeated use . I use to keep an outdoor stray cat warm and she loves it but the plastic is kinda breaking down . I just ordered another but great solution to keep cat warm . I put it in her bed and cover with warming pad has kept her really warm in extremely cold weather .	1
I 've used these for a couple of years now and my cats love them . Never held 12 hrs worth of heat maybe 6-8 and by then the temp is considerably less than when they came out of the microwave . I just microwave them before i leave for work and before i go to bed = happy cats .	1
It stays warm for at least 10 hours , probably longer . It 's also quite hard , and about an inch thick , so it 's no good on its own for my guy ; it is really only useful in a pet bed under the pad or under a few blankets .	1
I use this heating pad for the feral cats houses . it kept them very warm in cold New York winters	1
This is a great product . Ours came with the fleece cover , which it took our cat about 3 nights to rip apart at the seams . So definitely do n't pay extra for the cover . Our snuggle safe does n't actually stay warm for 12 hours -- more like 8 , which is still great . We also have a thermal pad for our cat , and we put the snuggle safe under it at night . This actually keeps the snuggle safe warm for 12+ hours .	1
Hesitant to purchase anything that is made of plastic , contains any kind of solution , AND that you have to heat in a microwave -- I went ahead and bought one for my stray outside cat ( He does n't like to come into the main house but will come as far as my mudroom ) . Right now we 're having wind chill temps in the single digits and my little farmhouse is cozy but on the drafty side -- with the mudroom being the chilliest room in the house . He LOVES this little warmer . After a day of chasing females , showing the other dudes in the neighborhood who 's the mane attraction , and acting like an all-around-bigshot , he meets me at the door when I get home from work . While I heat up his Snuggle Safe disk and slip it between the folds of his bed blanket , he eats his chow , cat chatters with me a while and then curls up into a fetal position draping himself over this little bit of heaven . I heat my disk for 6 - 6 1/2 minutes around 7 or 8 p.m. and when I check it in the morning around 6:30 a.m. before the Big Guy goes out , it 's still just warm enough to be snuggly . I then reheat it again about 7:30 a.m. and put it in his outside daytime bed before I go to work . It does n't last as long in the outside cold , but I still highly recommend it .	1
I had an outdoor kitty who was dumped off , found his way to my home and I adopted him.He did not like to be in the house and I worried about him during the winter , but made up a box , put it on the porch out of the weather , lined it with multiple layers of newspaper , put an old moving blanket on the bottom , then a shabby baby quilt I found at a flea market for $ 2 , and under the quilt , I would put a hot Snuggle Safe , he loved it , I put it on one side of thebox so if he got too warm , he could lay on the other side . I have used them for kittens too , and frankly , for myself , on cold nites , I warm up one , stick it under the covers at my feetand sleep comfortable all nite , when my feet get cold , I just move themover to where the SS is , and warm them up . It stays warm for me all nite long . I have even usedthem at my feet after coming inside from a freezing outdoor trip to warm up.Just make sure that neither pets nor humans using them are invalid so they ca n't move if itgets too warm for them . They DO get HOT after about 5 minutes in the microwave ! Do NOTplace on or in any plastic containers ( ie kennel crates ) unless well padded on the bottom.They will melt the plastic otherwise.They do last a long time , several years , and are much more durable than similar ones sold thatare made with fabric like shells , had one of those and it started leaking hot liquid after justa few times in the microwave . Have been using the Snuggle Safes for a good 7 years or so , andnot ever had one leak , during the winter , I am microwaving at least 2 every nite.I ca n't recommend these enough .	1
Keeps our cat warm at night and keeps us from worrying about leaving anything electrical running in case of fire . I would highly recommend it just pay attention not to overheat it as it might crack . Lasts for hrs and hrs .	1
My cat absolutely loves this particular kind of wet food . I use it in conjunction withWellness Indoor Health Adult Cat Food Bag , 5-Poundfor his daily nutrition . Every day when I go to refill his food I see the wet food completely gone and the dry food substantially depleted . I would say this more than proves he enjoys it . I also prefer the ingredients in this much better than some of the other stuff I see on the shelves .	1
All of my cats love this food , and the 12 and a half ounce can is perfect for my 4 kitties . Something about this flavor attracts my dogs , and I need to keep them away from it . Which a can of Wellness dog food usually does the trick . Wellness brand is by far the best in regard to both dry and wet food , and I 've tried them all . Though more expensive than some other brands , the litter boxes are cleaner and less smelly . This product goes a long way , so in the end the cost justifies itself immediately . We are all Very Happy with this product .	1
My kittens love this food and they certainly seem to be growing at healthy rate . My adult male cat does n't really eat it but he 's always preferred dry food so I buy this for the younger ones and their mother . Mom and the litter were abandoned so I 'm not sure what she was fed before but she seems to really like the food and its put some much needed weight on her . They seem to really like this flavor and the beef and chicken . Both are a bit smellier and oiler then the others but that 's probably what they like .	1
Good quality and my 4 month old kitten likes it . Recommended by the organization where I adopted McGee . What more could you ask for ?	1
I like this food because it is grain-free and very high quality meat . Cats , as obligate carnivores , do n't need grain , and in fact -- if you give them something with a lot of carbs , they will continue eating until they have enough protein.Since I switched my cats a few years back to this brand , both lost weight even though I feed them as much of this as they will eat . It completely transformed one of my cats . He was dumpy , overweight and middle-aged and since the food transition he lost weight and has become more active . His fur looks amazing ! I also recommended this food to a friend , forgot I made the recommendation and six months later was over his house and said , wow , your cat looks amazing ! He said , yeah , it 's the food change we talked about.That said , the Wellness line is not my cat 's favorite by any means . The reason is that it 's like switching a person from potato chips and McDonald 's to good healthy food . The supermarket brands such as Fancy Feast are filled with rendered fat , which smells great and makes cats go crazy . This has none of this , so they miss it . I transitioned VERY slowly , mixing the food they liked with a small amount of this and gradually increasing the proportion over months.Now , years later , my cat eats this with gusto -- though , of course , if I brought Fancy Feast back he would go nuts again for that , but I do n't . This is is his second favorite flavor after this one : Wellness Canned Cat Food , Chicken and Herring Recipe , 12-Pack of 12-1/2-Ounce Cans.The nice thing about this food is that , while he now eats it with apparent pleasure , my cat never overeats . I can give him as much as he wants/asks for and he stays the same weight . I 'd say he eats an average of a half 12-ounce can a day , but it varies -- some days he eats almost a full can , other days less than half . So essentially he self regulates , whereas with the kitty crack and dried food , full of grain , he overate.These large cans must be opened with a can opener . I buy them because they are a better value economically -- the small cans of this brand are way expensive . Even this is expensive per ounce , , but if you actually do a calculation of dollars paid per protein this one stacks up just fine to the less expensive brands . Which means my cat gets the nutrition he needs in fewer ounces . Any wet food is more expensive than dried food , but based on my cat 's consumption , feeding Wellness is not significantly more expensive than feeding mass-market wet food .	1
I feed all my cats , young and old , wellness wet cat food . They love it and so do I ! Ships free from Amazon on Sub & Save ... a real help for me as an older person .	1
What a great cat food . The ingredients list speaks for itself . My cat developed IBD , and could n't eat dry food anymore without vomiting . Some brands of wet food were fine , some were not , and the ones that were ( like Fancy Feast ) did n't seem very nutritious . I switched her to Wellness , and she has n't vomited in over three months . Although it 's more expensive than dry food , it 's not that much more expensive than most wet foods , when you buy it here from Amazon in bulk . My cat loves it ( but she loves everything ) , she 's been very healthy , and it 's saved me tons of money in medical expenses .	1
Arrived well b4 date expected . Good packaging . My cat loves this catfood . Eats it up immediately . Good health . Cat has a gorgeous shiny coat of fur . No allergies . What else can I say but it 's the best . It 's well worth the extra price , although amazon has the best price around . And , if bundled tog w/ other no shipping amazon products , then there 's no shipping costs w/ this purchase .	1
Wellness makes a good product . I do n't feel comfortable feeding my cat just any food given all the recalls . She likes it and she 's a very healthy active 14 year old with a beautiful coat .	1
My cat is very peculiar about food . He does not like a lot of flavors , but this one is a winner ! When I look for cat food , my main concern is the quality . Looking at the first ingredient is great , but reading through the rest of them might seem to be overwhelming , but I do that as well . Wellness presents as an outstanding product . I recently found out that cheap cat food brands like IAMS etc . use food flavoring and additives to make the food smell better than natural products , so it took my cat a few tries before he was convinced of the quality of this product : )	1
Wellness brand is a excellent and quality food for cats ( and dogs . ) My cats are quite happy eating this and it seems to help satisfy their appetite over feeding only dry food .	1
This is grain free and the cats like it . I prefer the smaller cans since the food stays fresher and is more appealing to the felines that way .	1
We feed one can of this per day to our three cats . They really enjoy the food and always come running when we are getting the can out of the cabinet.We chose this particular food because it 's one of the cheapest grain-free wet foods that we can get that still maintains a quality product . We have one diabetic cat and do not want the other two progressing that direction , so we switched over to grain-free to help control blood sugar.We 've been using this brand for several years now and have never gotten a bad bag of dry food or an expired lot of wet food . Would highly recommend to those watching what their cats are eating !	1
We switched our cat to a part kibble part wet food diet and she really loves this wet food ! Turkey and Salmon is a perfect and healthy balance for my kitty !	1
Only flavor my cats will always eat . Auto ship is nice to have . Price is better than going to the pet store .	1
Some people are complaining front line no longer works . I wonder if those people have other intentions by saying this . I 've used frontline for years with no problem .	1
Frontline Plus for Dogs 3 Mths 89-132 LbsI have tried other brands and nothing compares to Frontline.This is the best price I have found .	1
Our 2 puppies got it this year and , as far as I can tell , they are bug-free so far . I ca n't say whether this is because of Frontline or because there are no fleas in surroundings but , until evidence to the contrary emerges , I will give Frontline the credit.The makers claim that Frontline Plus kills all fleas and prevents re-infestation for up to one month . For 'paralysis tick ' protection , bi-weekly application is recommended but results are not guaranteed.The product comes in a number of 'pipettes ' that contain an oily-sticky liquid that is applied on the back of the dog 's neck 's , on the skin ( must part the coat until the skin is visible ) . The makers recommend monthly applications.I found it easy to treat the dogs . Given the relatively high price of this product , I 've been using one pipette for our 2 puppies . As they are now big , this may no longer be an option but I can see how this option could be a money saver for anyone who has 2 'not so large ' dogs.I am taking one star away because of the ridiculously high price .	1
I must say that I used this product for my dogs since long long time ago and I have no complaints about it.It is very good , simple to apply and very very effective which is the most important.I really recommend it and also this supplier as it has a very good price and arrive quicly .	1
This is the same product you can buy in the stores or in your Vet 's office but at half the price . Amazon representatives stated that Merial is their direct supplier .	1
This works great on my two dogs . I never see fleas or ticks . Set a monthly reminder on your phone to put it on them every month ! = )	1
Fast shipping and a great product . I love the fact that it actually works and is waterproof and it does ticks as well great and a perfect buy .	1
I used to use this to protect my large German shepherd mix up until the day he passed away at 15.5 years old . He never had any issues with fleas while on this product.I recently adopted two small dogs , about 20 pounds each . I use one packet to treat both of them . I bought some 1 cc syringes and some dispensing needles and just split the content of one pack evenly between my two dogs . Saves me a lot of money AND they get a proper dosage of the medicine .	1
Never seen one tick or flea on my dogs . Wish I could say the same for my kids : \ I have used other flea medications , but this one seems to have the least affects on my animals . No vomit , sluggishness or anything that I have experienced from other brands . Definite recommend .	1
Been using this stuff on my dogs for years and they are indoor/outdoor doggies . Not a single flea or tick when they are on it .	1
Our dogs have never had fleas or ticks as long as we 've used this product , and when applied directly to the skin it does n't leave oily residue all over their coats . This is also the very best price we 've found for it , and the shipping is very fast .	1
This is by far the cheapest I have found the Frontline Preventative and I have been using Frontline for many years . Very happy with my purchase !	1
This was easy to use and applied nicely on to my dog . Amazon is one of the cheapest places that I have found this . My dog did not like it much and he tried to get it off the back of his neck . I am not sure if he had a reaction to it , and that is why he was trying to get it off , or my dog could have just been playing around .	1
I love Frontline Plus for my cats , but it gets expensive . And then when I moved to a new neighborhood I found a few stray cats too . Before finding them new homes , I had to use flea control meds and it definitely got expensive . I 'm so glad this was created . I just hope that something like this can be created for the oral medication for Program too . I have some feral cats I ca n't touch and mixing Program in with their food is the only thing I can do , and that gets pricey too . I 'm very blessed I make good money , but still ...	1
During spring and summer seasons , I must apply Merial Frontline plus to my dog once a month . Dogs need it .	1
We have four dogs and flea meds can be very costly when purchased at local stores . Frontline works very well with our dogs and buying it through Amazon helps keeps our monthly cost down .	1
actually arrived as 2 3-packs , but that 's fine . Works well on the dogs as advertised .	1
Having really long , hot and dry Texas summers we also encounter a lot of fleas and ticks in our area . We 've been using Frontline plus for our dog religiously and never have we had a tick or flea coming home with us from our walks . So far we are happy with this product and will continue using it .	1
Some wrote that this was n't the real product which concerned me but they are wrong . If you order this product from Merial ( the maker ) , you will receive the real product . I am only giving this 4 stars because I would like to see it a bit cheaper . At this price , I might as well get it from my vet , it did not save me money .	1
I 've always used Frontline Plus on my dogs , a Jack Russel and a Border Collie . I live in the country and ticks are everywhere . When I find them on my dogs they are always dry and dead thanks to Frontline Plus . Fleas ? I do n't know what that is ...	1
We 've always used this product for our two beagles but were never able to find it at such a good price . Having two dogs , all our pet expenses are doubled . Being able to save means a lot to us .	1
I 've been using this product for years on my dogs.They do love playing in the grass where they 'll be likely to pick up fleas and ticks.This will kill existing fleas on your small dogs within 12 hours and all ticks and /or lice within 48 hours.It 's will kill the deer tick , which is the carrier Lyme disease.I have felt secure for years with this drop in guarding my dogs against these parasites .	1
I would rather not have to use a product that has some toxic stuff in it , but I think fleas and ticks pose a worse danger to my dogs and I have not found any natural products that work as well , so I will stick to this product . Amazon.com has the cheapest price that I have found , so that is why I buy it from them .	1
Just like at vets office but no reason to go to vets office came to my . Door I loved that	1
This applicator may be a little tough to apply to the dogs skin directly , but I am sure you will be able to manage . I recently used this product because I saw a flea on my dog . I used this product as instructed and have not see ticks since . However , my dog is still gnawing at his backside , but I am told that this could just be sensitive skin left after the fleas have bitten him .	1
I use it regularly on my standard poodle who goes into the woods with me very often . He 's never had a tick or any fleas , while my friend dog owners complain about their dogs getting ticks in those very woods frequently . No side effects like scratching or allergies , no smell.The only thing I do n't like about this product , but which does n't take away from its quality , is getting it out of the package - tedious and annoying , most often requires scissors .	1
Good price , will buy again.i usually buy from vet but it 's less expensive here so I am a amazon fan big time	1
great price . product was shipped quickly and when stated . I have doubts about using items such as this , due to side affects , but I use it sparingly .	1
I use Frontline on my Great Dane that is an outside dog . The Frontline has definitely help reduce the amount of fleas . Of course , being that he 's an outdoor dog , you are never really going to eliminate the fleas completely .	1
This product works well . It arrived promptly and has been keeping our household flea free . Pretty good deal also compared to other places .	1
It works and is easy to apply . I give the dog his heartworm meds as a treat for staying still to apply . No fleas have crossed our doorstep !	1
Frontline is the only product we have ever used on our dogs . We 've lived in a rural area for about 3 years and neither dog ever had even a single flea or tick . Great product that I highly recommend .	1
I have been buying this product for years and since my dogs are in and out of the house and run across land shared with deer and lots of varmints , a product is important . I have a small rescue dog that came with his own supply of another product and I found out that he had to switch to frontline in this environment . His product was totally inadequate.I have ten dogs , no flea problem .	1
There is not too much to say about this product . It works as advertised , and it is a must for dogs with an undercoat , such as a Golden Retriever , as their coat is simply too thick to police their skin 100 % for ticks and fleas . I 'm not saying do n't check them ! You absolutely must check over your pup for fleas and ticks , but Frontline gives you some extra protection.It is easy to administer , simply cut open the packet , spread your dog 's fur on their back between their shoulder blades to get to the skinline , and then squeeze out the solution on to one spot on their skin . Once a month is all it takes.An important note : If you are buying this product for the first time , please understand that when the makers and retailers advertise that it provides flea protection for up to three months , they mean by using three doses , one per month , not 3 months of protection for each dose.My main reason for writing this review is to mention how yet again Amazon manages to offer superior pricing on a product . Their prices for Frontline products is always a little less than other on-line retailers , and they blow pet stores out of the water , with prices about 30 % less . I imagine in coming months you will see some price cuts everywhere as Sentry and other manufacturers are releasing their own flea and tick protection product lines .	1
This is a great product -- it does work very well . My vets assistant told me if I buy Frontline from Amazon I am NOT getting a legit product as it is only sold to vets . While it is true it is only sold to vets..it is NOT true that the vets office is the ONLY place you can get a legit product.I emailed Merial and they confirmed I did indeed buy a legit product from Amazon . Go to the Merial web site -- email them , as I did and they will give you a phone number to call so you can verify whether or not you have a legit product.I am not saying do n't be careful ... please do..but I buy Frontline Plus from Amazon..it works and it is legit .	1
I have used topical Frontline Plus for years with all my dogs in conjunction with monthly oral doses of Sentinel and have had no problems with fleas , ticks , or heart worms ! It is very easy to use !	1
FYI ... . I had seen a previous review about the item being from France and so I was concerned that this was some off product . I decided to investigate more into this and discovered that even if you were to purchase in the store , it too is all made in France . I have never had issues with purchasing this product off of Amazon , nor another connected vendor . I always get free shipping , free sales tax , item is half the price of purchasing elsewhere , and my item is always as described .	1
I have 2 Miniature Poodles : one parti-color and one white . ( I buy the larger weight and apply half a vial to each dog ) The products purpose -- -YES -- it works , quite well . But my white poodle got an enormous stain on her back , where applied . Of course I waited to apply to a freshly groomed and trimmed little dog -- -- EWWWWW ! !	1
Even though I knew I was buying this from Amazon , I still priced them at other pet supply stores from the known chain stores to the small mom & pop stores . One store asked for $ 50 for a 3-pack ! My guess is the owner bought it from Amazon then did a huge mrk-up .	1
Does a pretty good job but my dog still gets fleas , it reduces the fleas if anything . But it works	1
advantage stopped working on my dog and cats , so we switched to frontline and have noticed a dramatic improvement in flea related stuffs .	1
It works great . The price was the best I found anywhere . My little dog had no reaction problem . That is important since he has reactions to various allergens	1
All of the other brands are a waste of time . Merial Frontline is the only brand that has ever worked on our dog . I wo n't waste my money on any of the cheaper options .	1
We live in Maryland which turns out to be tick heaven . This stuff has worked great on keeping the pests off !	1
make sure before administering heartworm medication that your pets have a yearly heartworm test . If they do not it could be dangerous for them !	1
we use this on our dog and it keeps the fleas and ticks off . convenient packaging and easy to use . kills adult fleas within 48 hours	1
We give this to our dog mainly to prevent ticks and it seems to do the job . The only thing that bothers me is that after applying this our dog seems to be lethargic for a couple of day , probably a chemical in it . You just have to make your own decision on the pro 's vs. con 's of using a product like this .	1
I have been using this product on my dogs for many years and I will continue to use it because it is so effective . Also I do not want to use one of the oral products .	1
My dogs have used frontline plus for several years . I tried a different brand in the beginning of summer , and for me that was a mistake . Anyway we are back to Frontline -- for my dogs it works .	1
I have a 3 year old Golden Retriever that spends a lot of time outside . I want to make sure he is always protected from fleas and ticks and Frontline is the best I have ever tried . I have tried Advantage II and a lot of other generic brands , but this one is by far the best . We live in North Carolina , so the fleas and ticks never actually go away and I have had no problems with them throughout the year with Frontline .	1
One of the best topical flea preventions .	1
Shipping was fast , got it within a week with Free Super Saving Shipping . Says that it stops all stages of fleas , and kills and protects against chewing lice and ticks as well - I 'm not sure about the chewing lice and ticks , but I did find fleas on my Lab puppy when I got him . I use this on him , and within two weeks I did n't find any on him at all , not even after I bathe him and used a flea comb on him . Says it works up to a month , and is water-proof.I 'd highly recommend .	1
I found this online for a much better price than even the big box club store price ! As my dogs winter down south I need protection year round . Never a allergic reaction to Frontline Plus . No fleas no ticks on pups or me .	1
FRONTLINE works great . It 's a must better deal to buy this online than in the vets office . It is easy to apply and does n't goop up .	1
I ordered this for my dads 2 miniature dashounds . It works well for them . They have had reactions to heart guard meds so he worries about any chemicals . But this works exactly as it should .	1
We were paying $ 15 per month to get this product at our vet 's office . We have saved a lot of money buying it online , and it comes right to our door , so it is more convenient , too . We camp and hike and do a lot of activities in the tick ridden out-of-doors here , and with Permethrin on our clothes and this on our golden retriever Daisy , we are tick free when we get home . ( If we do find a tick on her , it is already dead and comes off easily . For this reason , we still get her the Lyme 's vaccination each year . ) This is our first dog , and we worried about needing to get our carpets in our home `` bombed '' for fleas every fall , like a lot of our friends need to . With this product , she has never brought home a single ( living ) flea.We travel a lot going to our son 's gymnastics and swim meets , and Daisy gets boarded 10 or more weekends each winter . If we forget to use this every month in the winter ( and we sometimes do ) we can put it on her two days before boarding , and any fleas she picks up from other dogs there ( or at the dog park ) will be dead before we get her home . She was frightened by fireworks once at my sister 's lake house , and bolted in panic and was lost in the woods for two nights . When she found her way home 33 hours later , she had over 100 ticks on her , but every one was dead.I ca n't say enough good things about this product .	1
My breeder recommended Frontline Plus and I have not changed except for once and my Shetland Sheepdog kept scratching his nose so I went back and all is fine once again . Will not change to another product .	1
I have been using Frontline plus on my dog for all of his 6 years of life and he has NEVER had a single flea or tick on him . He attends doggy daycare where they have had flea outbreaks in the past but he has never been effected . Based on this history of the product working well and preventing any flea issues I feel it is definitely worth it to continue to use this product every month . I have also compared the benefits of this product with other flea and tick products and this seems to be the best you can get . The health of and well being of my dog is just as important as my own so I will continue to use this product as it has been successful for my dogs whole life and I have confidence that the product truly works .	1
This Frontline Plus has been working great on both our gsd dogs who love to go out into the woods with us..will continue to use as long as it works .	1
This worked pretty fast on my rottweiler . Less than a day he stopped scratching and whining about those pesky little fleas on him . Even after jumping in the pool he has been free of fleas .	1
I have always used Frontline and it works well for my pets . I would purchase this again . Shipment was quick and the price reasonable .	1
We 've had an especially bad year with ticks and I have to use a treatment that works . Frontline Plus works very well for ticks - not as well with fleas as it used to but still works .	1
This brand was recommended by our vet . We like the easy application ( though it took us a few times to figure out how to get our Lab to sit upright while it 's put on -- if she lays down , it oozes over to one side . I do n't think it 's an actual problem in terms of effectiveness , but we 'd rather it did n't get on the carpet ) .	1
I have been using this product for 4 months now and i can say i am really satisfied so far . The delivery is always on time , the item is well packaged and the price is great . I like the big protection that it offers against parasites and it is very easy to apply monthly thanks to the pipes . I brought my dogs on hikings , at the park , in open fields and this Frontline Plus seems to work ( i always check my dogs anyway ) . Just follow carefully the instructions in the package and you will do a perfect job . Of course i always avoid to bath my pet for 48 hours after i apply the product and be carefull to check your dogs for some hours , you want to notice if there is any change on the behaviour or they show any symphtom . I have been lucky and they always have been ok. Wash your hands well especially the first days after you pet your dog , it 's always a bunch of chemicals that you do n't want to ingest . Will purchase it again and again , maybe on the 6 months package now .	1
'Frontline ' is considered the best and most effective flea & tick control product on the marketplace . Sure , you will see other brands that cost much less than 'Frontline ' , but you get what you pay for . I 've been told by my vet and pet store managers , on several occasions , that most of the other products out there have been known to cause more siezures and deaths in dogs , as compared to the safer and more effective and proven 'Frontline ' product . My dog had flea issues , and was scratching endlessly for days . Just a few hours after I applied this product ( simple 1 spot application between dog 's shoulder blades on back ) , my dog stopped scratching , and is resting happily . 'Frontline ' worked in no time !	1
No different than found in a vet 's office . A good buy and came in adequate time .	1
I was not sure if I should order online or just go to the vet . The reviews on amazon were the reason I was more willing to go and just buy it . However , I decided to order them because I knew for what to watch out , and I was aware on how to check if the product is fake by reading the reviews . The Frontline came last Tuesday , and it just happens that it has come a day before I have to apply the formula to the dog . I am happy with the product ; I don & # 8217 ; t see any fleas on my dog . I have been buying this product for a year and a half now , so far I have to say that I am really happy with this product . I will update this post if I see any changes . I am a bit concerned that they might have had change the formula , since a lot of people mention it .	1
We have used Frontline on our dog her entire life ( she just turned 5 ) and it works great . We spend a lot of time outdoors with her so our primary concern is ticks . This past weekend we were up in North Dakota with her and my Dad and his dog - my dad 's dog had on another tick control product and we found over a dozen ticks on him each night but our dog never had more than 2 . I think the ticks would have died and fallen off if we had n't found them first .	1
When used regularly it seems to do a good job . My dog does not get fleas or ticks and she does go outside	1
I think this is the best flea med around . Never any problems using it and the price was a bargain . Thanks for timely delivery too !	1
Frontline Plus is a top product , and your prices are amazing . For sure , I will it get again . Peggy W .	1
Not sure how it works , but it works . This season has been brutal in the Northeast for Ticks , and thankfully our Lab/Bully has not been attacked . Our vet said his office has been flooded with Tick problems and said 90 % of the patients were on Frontline , I was surprised . But we have not had any problems yet .	1
I have used Frontline Plus Flea & Tick control for years on my cats and now on my dog , I tried cheaper brands early on and found they did not control the flea and ticks . I never see a flea on my animals , a tick once in a great while if it has just attached to the fur and has not gotten to the skin where the poison is . That has only happened maybe one or two times and I was able to pull off and kill	1
IT COSTS TO MUCH I HAVE GOT IT FOR LESS AN I THINK ITS TERRIBLE THAT THE PRICE GOES UP . MR. BOGY TURNED 11 ON THE 30TH HE IS MY SERVICE DOG A YELLOW LAB NEEDS HIS MEDS BUT IS GETTING TO EXSPENSIVE	1
This summer and into the fall , my dogs went through a tick infestation . I tried several different products , and this one worked the best . I have 3 small dogs and I actually purchase the largest size tube and use a syringe to measure their dosage , which I found on another web site . If you use these flea and tick products , you know how expensive it is.So , it works very well killing fleas and ticks and if you find out what your dog 's dosage is , you can purchase larger tubes and save a bunch of money .	1
Able to apply to one spot on my dog with little effort ; we will see how well it works over time .	1
Although I hate to use chemicals and toxic solutions , sometimes needs must ... ..Purchasing the larger size product and measuring it out for my small dogs is the only economical way to use this product . Frontline Topical is effective for killing fleas , but the actual length of time that is effective is actually only about 2 weeks ... .less for the Frontline spray . This past summer has been particularly bad for controlling fleas due to the weather conditions .	1
I got the product on time and it arrived as ordered . I was not disappointed . Buy it ! You will not be disappointed .	1
We use this on our 70 lb dog once a month and have n't seen a tick or flea on him in over a year . We 've found our share of ticks on the people here , but we do n't use Frontline on them . We are surrounded by farming fields and have half an acre for the dog to run and roll around in , so I 'm guessing the treatments work . They 're kind of expensive , but much better than the old flea and tick collars we used to buy .	1
placed order and arrived 2 days after to CA ! fastest shipping ever . Packaging seems legit and similar to vet , not a tube kit , great deal , great seller .	1
My dogs have been using this product for years and it works very well on them . The occasions that the dogs attracted fleas and/or ticks were often due to my fault of not sticking to the schedule . Monthly application is the key because we live in a subtropical environment . Skipping two months a few times caused tons of headaches on us dealing with flea or tick infestations . So far my dogs have n't had any negative reactions to it .	1
Have applied this to my dog for years . It was recommended by our veterinarian and it works well . Highly recommend to others .	1
I would give it 5 stars if it was n't an oily topical that you have to avoid touching for 2 days until fully absorbed . I know the flea protection works and can only hope that the tick protection works , too . I like that it 's supposed to repel ticks and lice.There is a new one out called NEXGARD that is oral , but I 'm reluctant to try it since it currently only lists one tick type and is n't a repellant , so the tick has to bite the dog before it kills it .	1
I like this product because it is waterproof ( relatively speaking ) - with 2 dogs that like to swim , therefore requiring more frequent baths ( salt water swimming ) this does n't wash outRecently after coming back from a field walk we were covered with ticks - our Brittany did n't have one ! It also does n't irritate their skin like other productsRemember not to apply at the same time you give your monthly Heartwork meds - that is way too much toxins for your pet !	1
Fibronil ( active ingredient ) seems to work well -- my dogs ( 4 ) have not picked up any ticks in the backyard or on walks in the past 2 years of regular use.I like FrontLine because the total volume applied is fairly low and not too greasy , so after application you do n't get a huge grease-streak down the dog 's back that makes them gross and under quarantine for most of the day.I also like the easy snap and apply set up on the applicator -- very easy to use.I DO N'T like the packaging . Each vial is in foil-like blister pack that is a giant pain to get open -- I end up using my pocket knife but care must be taken to pierce the foil without cutting into vial of liquid itself.An additional feature I 've read about but not tried is that you can apply this to cotton balls and leave a few around the yard -- mice will take them and use them as bedding in their nest . Since mice are a primary vector for ticks and lyme disease , when the mice bring it to the nest it will kill off all the ticks . BUT fibronil is toxic to cats . . . so you need to be careful you do n't kill your neighbor 's outdoor cat . . . or any strays . . . I have n't tried it , but for heavy tick areas this could be an effective approach if it works .	1
Been using Frontline for years and have found no better substitute . Works great as always and our dog has never had flea problems .	1
This liquid prevents the full development of fleas and repels ticks . It works well to keep my large dog flea free ; unless of course we go some where with adult fleas that jump onto my dog.I have not found ticks on my dog ; but I have got them on myself numerous times walking on the trails with my dog on leash.I have not found fleas on my dog after using this product consistently . It is great to see my dog not scratching from fleas.I tried many other liquids and powders ; but this one and `` Advantage '' are the two that have worked well for my dog with thick fur .	1
I have four dogs and so frontline is a must . I always purchase from Amazon as the prices are almost half what my vet asks . Free shipping , packaging is always good . Items are always as described and new in the pack . IMO , no other flea treatment on the market works as well as Frontline Plus . Purchasing it in larger size is more cost effective . I eye how much I put on my dogs and use it on my cats too . Can treat 3-4 pets out of one dose .	1
I 've used this product for several years with great success . My boxer hates to have it put on - but she 's the one who needs it most - she has sensitve skin and is allergic to flea bites and other insect bites too . My lab and my husky are both big dogs with lots of deep fur and they have never had a problem with fleas - I credit this product with their flea free lives !	1
I have n't yet used this order but past experience has been good with Frontline . Beats sprays and shampoos . Best to be sure fleas are the cause and not allergies as I found the latter was the main problem my dog has but eliminating fleas has helped and we 're working on the allergies and trying to stay short of using steroids .	1
I only buy frontline for my dog and it always seems to work . Thanks frontline !	1
We have been using Frontline on our dogs for almost 25 years . We always have two or more greyhounds here and because of their low body fat , they are VERY sensitive to chemicals and can have a bad reaction to a lot of seemingly normal pet meds . Frontline is the gold standard for flea and tick preventive and greyhounds absolutely tolerate it with no problems whatsoever.We live on a farm and we frequently take the dogs out into the fields for exercise and fun and this is where they can pick up loads of ticks and fleas - and we have yet to have a problem because of Frontline . We 've never seen them on any of our dogs.At one point we did try a cheaper external flea/tick med and the dogs had a bad reaction with itch . We tried a chewable flea and tick med and even though it worked , they suffered from gastritis for a day after the initial dose . So , it was back to Frontline and it 's been Frontline ever since.Note : The previous problems with a 3rd party seller have been rectified and authentic Frontline is directly available from Amazon . We have verified this .	1
I only use frontline when I come across fleas or ticks , not every month , and it has worked well for me over the last 5 yrs or so . I buy this Large pkg and split between all the dogs , so I am not giving to much or too little and I save a lot of money in the process . This seller shipped quickly and was a decent price !	1
This fipronil medicine is a breakthrough in pet care . I researched the medical articles thoroughly to make sure it 's safe for my dogs . The research shows that this is one of the safest medicines on the market . The fleas are COMPLETELY GONE ! I have never seen a single flea or tick on my dogs after using this product . The review from the other person about sluggishness in their dog is jumping to conclusions based on a coincidence . There is nothing in the medical research to indicate that would be a side effect . There are no side effects other than temporary reddish skin at the site of application and even that was in a rare number of cases ( skin can get irritated from just about anything ) . The bottom line is that the fleas hate this product , and I love this product !	1
I use this on my small dog who is quite old . Works fine . I have to use Heartguard too in order to get the heart worms . I use Trifexis for my bigger younger dog and that is one pill and done ... BUT that does not get ticks .	1
Frontline Plus is the only product I 've used until present when we started using a multi-purpose Heart worm topical that includes some tic and flea protection . Seems one still needs Frontline type protection anyway..Consider getting a syringe and small container ( available on web ) and splitting larger does Frontline over two or more applications . I 'd not be comfortable using one so large that it took more than two or three months to use it all - and keep the unused portion in a cool/dark place I have been told .	1
If it works , then it 's a good product in my opinion . I have a 7 lb white Chihuahua and she has an allergy to fleas so she suffers hair loss if she gets flea problems . Once I used this medication , her beautiful white fur grew back . That 's all it took for me to know this product works and is reliable .	1
I rescued a cute little dog . Well , after a few days , I found that she had ticks . I have never had a dog with ticks before so I did not know what to do . I probably did not have problems before as my dogs always had Frontline to keep them flea free . I bought this and immediately started the applications . It took a few weeks but now I rarely find any on her and when I do , most of the time they are dead or almost dead . I feel the product does what it is suppose to do .	1
I have a small yorkshire terrier and I bought this for him and use it on a regular basis . He does n't scratch as much but he does scratch a bit . He has long hair so it is expected . I will keep buying this flea treatment in the future .	1
I 've had all 4 of my dogs on Frontline Plus as long as I have had them . I 've never had a flea problem and rarely if ever find ticks on them . I am a Vet Tech and at our office we do n't sell Frontline anymore as people were complaining that it was n't working , but I personally have never had a problem and am very happy with it .	1
Pleased have used this item before for my baby and it seems to be effective . Thanks.Frontline Plus for Dogs , For Dogs Blue,23-44 lbs ; 6 Month Supply	1
Check out the FAQ 's on the Frontline website . Here are a couple of quick tips I 've learned that have helped.-Your pet should not be bathed or swim for 24 hours after Frontline is applied . If it is applied after a bath , be sure your pet is thorougly dry.-The longer you use it the more effective it is , single applications are not nearly as effective.-You can still have a flea problem even after treatment due to the life cycle of a flea and timing of the treatment . Best thing to do is to continue treatment in the meantime.-Also , you may see increased flea activity after applying Frontline.-Frontline is definitely beneficial for tickborne illnesses . The tick needs to be attached for 36 hours before the pet can be infected , 36 hours is typically how long it takes for a tick to die after attaching to a pet treated by Frontline .	1
Merit Frontline is the only brand we have used since my 80lb German Shepherd was a puppy . No issues since and very easy to apply between his shoulders under his fur coat , when he is focused on eating his meals . If you get any on your fingers , simply wash it off with soap . He goes out to the woods in our backyard to do his business and Frontline helps keep the fleas and ticks away .	1
Since applying this to Phineas , I 've given him a bath , and it did not stop working . It also did not irritate his skin like my last attempt ( BioSpot ) did . We love it , and NO Ticks !	1
Frontline is a must in the midwest . It has worked to protect my pup from both regular pesky fleas and sand fleas . I did some research and found out that it may last up to 2 months or longer ( especially if you do n't bathe your pet much ) , so I have only been applying it every 45 days vs every 30 days-to save $ $ $ .	1
As usual Frontline comes through . I have bought off brands and then still had to buy Frontlne . So do n't bother with buying the offbrands . Or go ahead waste your $ too and learn for yourself !	1
Always check Amazon first when I need a supply of Frontline for my 2 dogs . Usually they have the best price .	1
We have used this product for years , and the cat version also for fleas and ticks , and it works very well in our area of The Woodlands , Texas , although I 've heard that in certain parts of Texas , the fleas are becoming resistant to it , but I 've not experienced that in my area , but we do use it year round here in the south .	1
Frontline always help keep the fleas and ticks away anytime I take my dog in the woods I know she is safe	1
Our 50 pound Shar-Pei races around the dog park for an hour or two every weekday , through brush and tall grass . Frontline has kept her free of ticks and fleas .	1
This is a good product , but I wish they made it in a pill like some of the other products . I 'm just not convinced that it works as well after a bath .	1
I 'll admit , I bought this without realizing it was a kit . That explains why the price is so low , but hey , it 's well worth it . Why spend more ? You ca n't beat the price and if it means measuring it out in the little vial provided , it 's worth it for all the money saved.Frontline itself is a great product . Someone mentioned it does n't take care of the whole problem . It does , but depending on how bad the fleas are , sometimes it takes longer . If you put this on before the first sign , or at the first sign , you 'll notice the difference right away . However if you 're pretty infested , as fleas spread so darn quick , it sometimes takes a month or two of continued use due to the fleas being everywhere and re-habiting your pet . I personally use frontline as well as Sentinel , which is a once a month 5-in-1 pill that prevents fleas/ticks/heartworm and others.I highly recommend frontline , and this cheaper kit , to anyone with pets !	1
Excellent !	1
I absolutely love this product for protection for my pets . It 's a reasonable price too ! It works great and I recommend using protection on your pets .	1
Unlike harts that killed on of my pets this item is safe and easy to use . I recommend this product	1
Trying this one out . Advantage did n't work for our dog . Easy to use applicator and instructions and hopefully keeps the fleas away .	1
Has n't given them cancer , has n't allowed any fleas or ticks in the house . We know there are fleas where we walk but I laugh as they attempt to jump on my dogs which like little death ninjas have but to secrete this oil and BAM THEY DIE LIKE THE VERMIN THEY ARE . Actually I think fleas are pretty cute , if they were n't annoying and a disease carrier , I 'd probably have a flea farm much like an ant farm to admire them .	1
I trust frontline plus for my dogs and have used it several years , ,only one time it seemed not to work and do n't know if it was just a bad batch or what but used something else a few times then went back to it and am still using it . It does n't seem to cause any side effects so I will use it and it works , ,no fleas or ticks on my babies ?	1
This is a great product . We have been using it for some time . My son uses it also for his dogs .	1
Helps keep my Dog healthy because she plays in the grass and flies and ticks can hide their . It is also the best and cheapest in my View	1
I currently live in NH and the blood sucking critters here , like many places , are atrocious . I do a lot of field work and take my dog to accompany me . Because we are out so much this leaves us often being used as a buffet . When I get home I am able to get all the ticks off me , but my dog is a black lab which causes difficulties in always finding the ticks . I like this product because when I do n't find the ticks right away , I will often find them in the morning dead on the floor . I have not found one engorged tick on her yet , which is really saying something . When it comes to ticks and fleas it does exactly what it is supposed to . If it is n't , I would check to make sure it is the real thing . Now , if you are expecting this to repel mosquitoes or various flies this is not the product . I would recommend getting a fly/mosquito repellent collar as well . We need to make sure to protect our pets against the outside critters and I recommend this product .	1
My dogs have n't had fleas since I started using frontline . It 's mid-priced , so if you 're watching your pennies , this product is for you if you want something that really works .	1
I have purchased this for 4 years for my Scottie Ebony . I had always obtained them from the Vet . They work so well and he has never had a single flea or tick that I ever found . He is more of a house dog but goes outside to his spot to do his business . But he loved to roll in the grass in our large backyard . He has never had a case of heartworms and I also give him HeartGard medicine to prevent worms in his heart . I always have to buy the larger size for him because the smaller size does not have enough to cover him and protect him .	1
This is the original quality frontline labeled in metric . A check of the ingredients and package shows that the ingredients are exactly the sameas the old boxes . I 've never had a problem with this product .	1
It 's cheaper than Costco , my vet , and other places online . For the exact same product ( I hope ) , only differentiation is price .	1
This is a really good value , I paid almost the same price from pet stores and vet offices for only a 3 month supply . Will be getting it here from now on .	1
We get these every time because they are the best price we can find . You ca n't beat prime shipping either . Definitely recommend . We use these for both of our dogs .	1
Same product as I 've been getting from the vet but at a fraction of the cost . I 'd recommend this to anyone . Packaged and delivered as promised .	1
Cheaper than buying it at my vet 's office , same quality products . Works as far as I can tell , we have n't had any issues with fleas or ticks for my little cavapoo puppy .	1
We have 4 dogs and live on acreage ... .lots of bugs this year and I rely on this product . Works well ! And this price is really good .	1
My dogs need this every month , the price was good and it arrived promptly , just in time for their treatment .	1
We adopted a stray dog that prefers to be an outside dog . Living in a rural area , she has free roam of several acres of land and was constantly scratching at fleas . I had tried products from our Local Feed and Seed but they did n't keep her flee free . Frontline Plus has been a miracle . Not only does it keep her from scratching from fleas , it kills the flea cycle . Fleas still get on her but they do n't live long enough to cause a problem . Amazon 's price was considerable LESS than what I would have paid at the Vet 's office ... .PLUS I used my Amazon Chase card and took advantage of my collected 'points ' which brought the price down to almost NOTHING .	1
I apply theMerial Frontline Plus Flea and Tick Control for 0 to 22-Pound Dogs and Puppies , 6-Packon my dog each and every month , as I did with my previous dogs . It 's now available in many stores as well as the vet 's office , but the prices vary greatly and Amazon 's are very competitive . I 've used the regular Frontline , but find the additional control of the Plus version better suits our needs . The tubes are easy to apply , but I always have difficulty removing them from the enclosure . Since I 've started cutting them out of the package , I 've reduced the difficulty . Our dog knows what 's coming when she sees me pull out the package and she sits like a champ in front of me . I part the hair on her upper back and gently squeeze the entire tube directly onto the skin . I make sure that her bath is not scheduled for a day before or after the application and if the weather is such that she 'll need to wear a sweater , I 'll apply immediately after a walk to allow the medicine ample time for absorption before I need to `` dress '' her again in a sweater and/or her harness . I wash my hands really well and dispose of the packaging immediately and sometimes wear gloves to protect my skin from absorbing any of the medicine . I 'm happy to report that we 've not seen a tick or flea on the dog or around our home since using this product on any of our pets over many years . Some people do n't use this year round , but I believe it 's worth using even if I ca n't see any ticks or fleas outside .	1
Great product . I was hoping it would kill my stinking Chihuahua but instead it only killed all the bad things that want to suck its blood !	1
I have never seen a flea or tick on my dog , and give it to him year round . Amazon has the best price , perfect all around .	1
This stuff is fantastic and it lasts for a month . The price here is far cheaper than in the pet stores and WAY CHEAPER than what a vet would charge . Most vets probably buy it on Amazon ! I put it on my dogs and the itching stops . Simple as that .	1
No complaints about this product , it is working well on my two dogs , they are completely flea-lice-tick-free . My dogs live in the house with me , but they do spend time playing outside in the grass . I have used Frontline before , and I have used other brands of flea protection , but Frontline has always been the best protection . I was happy to find Frontline for a great price on Amazon . So long as the good price remains , I will continue to purchase Frontline from Amazon and use it on my dogs . A really good product with no adverse effects of any kind . Recommended for anyone with pets ( they have a Cat version too ) , especially for those pets who go outside , but live in the house -- - or for those most unfortunate dogs and cats who are , sadly , forced to live outside -- - these pets need this protection the most ! When used regularly on your pets who do live in the house , it prevents fleas , lice , and ticks from being brought into your home .	1
Live with woods all around us and poor lil Abby was coming in with ticks on her ! I switched to this and have not seen ONE ! Just purchased for six more months . This is my product from here on in !	1
Keeps fleas and ticks totally off our dogs despite the fact that we 're out in the fields and woods a lot . I trust Frontline Plus !	1
Would not be with out Frontline for my dogs.. I do n't have to worry about fleas or ticks at all	1
I 've been using Frontline on my Cocker for years . It 's been a reliable product that keeps my dog free of flea bites . Since she 's free of annoying fleas so is my apartment and my very elderly cat . I use it on her all year long but have noticed the need to stick to that 30 day interval during the prime flea Summer months . During the Winter if I miss the application by a week or so she is still doing fine .	1
I had trouble with the product working , until I found out you should n't put it on your pet two days priotr to shampooing or until two days after you shampoo your dog . I was also told by my vet that It works with the oil in the dog 's skin and I should n't be using people shampoo on my pet . I made these changes and it has kept my pet flea free . I recommend this product	1
As a dog trainer and for my own dog I like this product . I like to go hiking with my large dog and this is great for tick season ! -Julie the online dog trainer from [ ... ]	1
It was awesome to be able to get this product online and have it come to my door . I would recommend this product and this company for their quick service .	1
Though I hate how messy Frontline Plus can be ( try applying it to a squirmy puppy ! ) , it does get the job of keeping fleas and ticks away from my pups . It 's odorless , and other than that oily patch of fur , fairly unobtrusive . Now that Sentinel is back on the market I admit that I prefer that , but it does n't protect against ticks , which are bad this year . Frontline Plus does .	1
Put on dogs and it kept away the deer ticks . This is why I purchased this product . We live way out in the country and have deer in our pasture that gets close to dog corral . Will purchase again .	1
This was a real bargain . We must shop carefully as pet supplies are expensive . I would purchase again . thank you .	1
Thanks to Frontline Plus , my 9 year old lab/shepherd mix has never had a flea or tick . He spends all day every day outside and yet the insects leave him alone . We 've never seen any ill-effect from this product . We re-apply every month as directed.I wish they made a version for humans that kept mosquitoes away for a month !	1
I have two Malteses and they had SERIOUS fleas . One of my poor babies was simply crawling and could not go long without scratching . I tried the Little City Dogs products last month ( both the Capsar knockoff and the Program knockoff ) and neither did a thing . I did n't want to use another product immediately , so I waited a long month to buy Frontline Plus.I have used Frontline Plus successfully in the past , but the price gave me pause this time around . I had also heard that the product was becoming less effective . That does not seem to be the case for the fleas in my neck of the woods ( and by neck of the woods I mean Philadelphia ) .24 hours after applying Frontline Plus one of my dogs was flea free and the other had slow-moving fleas . It looked like a flea death march . 48 hours after applying the product both are free of live fleas and look much more comfortable . One still has flea dust which I will comb out later today.I did purchase the product for large dogs and distributed an appropriately sized dose to each of my small dogs . This was a cost saving measure that I am NOT recommending to others as I am not a vet . So , this batch would last me three months for both dogs . I discard the extra in the vial.Important Notes : ( 1 ) Do not wash your dog for at least a few days prior to treatment . The sweat in the hair and on the skin helps the product to adhere . ( 2 ) Do not wash your dogs for at least a few days after treatment for this same reason . ( 3 ) Read the box carefully , and return it if you see any red flags ( i.e . product name on vial does not match box ) Also , in response to the `` Buyer Beware '' posted on 10/15/12 . My product has none of the issues that this reviewer mentioned.1 . I did receive calendar stickers with the product.2 . The back of the vial was properly labeled `` Frontline Plus '' 3 . My vials were sealed appropriately ( and were quite difficult to open ) .I did n't check my lot number , but all in all this product seems fully legitimate to me .	1
Some of the puppies she plays with on occasion DO have fleas , so the fact that she still does n't have them is wonderful !	1
The fleas get use to this and my dog does n't get full thirty day protection so when this starts to not last long I take a break from this and use another brand , and when that one fails I switch again .	1
I always buy Frontline here because of better pricing . Frontline always works for my five Labradors . Never a pest problem when used as directed .	1
I found this to be a great deal . it is a great product and I actually need to order some more now . If you are thinking about buying this ... go ahead . Good deal and this is what my vet sells .	1
I have used this product for over 10 years and have never had fleas even when they swim during the summer .	1
On the coast we get a bunch of fleas , ticks and mosquitoes all the time and this is really the only thing that saves my dogs !	1
I buy this for my corgi and it helps her , she does not scratch , this is what i have always used for her and no problems and all .	1
This is the best price I have come across and killed those one or two fleas that I could see but not get myself : )	1
I bought this because Amazon does n't sell the individual tubes of Frontline Plus anymore . I use this so I can give my 25 cats and 1 large dog monthly protection . I have 20 cats in a kitty colony and 5 of my own . This is the only way I could afford to treat them all . This kept all ticks and fleas off my cats until the last week it was good for , I found 1 tick on my outside cat Cookie , and a couple of fleas on the rest . I did n't find any fleas on my own house cats . I did n't find any fleas or ticks on my dog either . It works good . I know this is marketed as a dog product but this is Frontline Plus that can be safely used for cats . I use a 1.0ml syringe to give my cats 0.5ml dose . For Frontline Plus this is the dose for all cat weights . If you would like more info about it please look up , Lisa Violet Cat House . She has all the weights and proper dosages listed.Also there are some that CAN NOT be used on cats such as the newer version of Frontline and also Advantix . Plain Advantage or Advantage II IS safe to use on cats and rabbits in addition to dogs . If you have any questions feel free to message me .	1
This is a product that I have used for a while now . I was very happy to find it at a price I could afford . Fast service .	1
We 've been giving our dog this medicine for years and its always done a good job of keeping the ticks and other things off of him . We have found a few dead ticks in his fur , but never a live one and certainly not one head deep into his blood supply . Applying it is n't so difficult but since our dog is white , it does leave a discoloration in his fur until his next bath . This is what our vet recommended so we 're going with it and it works fine .	1
Frontline is a must for my pup who runs in the dunes / woods often . Ticks are everywhere and this ensure she is protected ( more than me , in fact ! ) . It has always kept the ticks at a minimum .	1
We were really getting a lot of ticks crawling on us . I put this on the boys and the ticks just disappeared . We do n't usually have a flea problem , so this was n't an issue . They are happy and so are we .	1
I got my 35 pound Boxer Mix from a shelter and seemed to scratch a decent bit , but within 24 hours of giving her this no more scratching or chewing ! !	1
Frontline has a well deserved reputation . I had thought that with the cold weather I would not need to apply Frontline for a few months -- BIG MISTAKE . My `` Puppy Child '' starting over scratching himself . I discovered a flea . Yes , I was ashamed of myself , but quickly solved the problem with a hasty order of Frontline . Just as advertised , within 12 hours , problem solved .	1
I have had my dog on Frontline consistantly throughout his life and we have never had a problem with fleas or ticks . We recently moved to tick-infested area , and during the tick season I found quite a few ticks on my dog , ALL DEAD . Frontline does exactly what it says it does , kills the ticks that attach . They just flake off .	1
This product was recommended by my dog 's Veterinarian . I was concerned about what to use on him since he was so small . This product did n't cause any issues at all even with his skin which is supposed to be sensitive on a Yorkie .	1
i mean this is exactly what you pay for . very happy with the price and will buy again in 6 mos : )	1
The product arrived on time . Product always works as it should , but I think I will start buying at costco since I saw it was cheaper there .	1
I am very pleased with the this product . 3 MONTH Frontline PLUS Orange for Dogs 0-22 lbs I have used it on two dogs and neither ever had one problem with this . No reactions and best of all , never a flea . It was recommended to me by my vet and I am pleased with it . Also note , that if you have cats , there are certain products that you should not use on your dogs since they can be fatal to a cat living in the same household . This is something not everyone knows , so please check with your vet if you have a mixed household of pets .	1
I 've bought Frontline for my pets for years . I like it much better than the flea collars . Keeps the bad stuff off my fur kids .	1
Good product and will purchase it again.It works like they say it will to rid my dog of fleas.Thank you	1
We 've found this product to be very effective for flea and tick control , and have never been aware of any side effects . We 'd been ordering it from pet med sites until we discovered it was a bit cheaper Amazon Prime .	1
We love Frontline . It is simple to apply . We NEVER have those nasty , painful parasites.Yes ! Purchase this product for your pets .	1
The newer products do n't offer tick control -- just flea and some digestive protection that I have no use for . My dogs need flea AND tick protection because we hike grassy ranges , forests , and riverbanks . This product is reliable and has kept my dogs healthy for years . I actually tried the newer product for one season at the urging of my vet , and my dogs constantly became infested with ticks that summer . Put them all back on Frontline - have n't had that problem since .	1
Got house dogs that do n't mingle with outside dogs ? Do n't frontline all of them , frontline ONE of them and it becomes a flea killing machine . Then , the next time you see a flea ( it can be easily up to a year later ) frontline a different dog . It 's less expensive , easier on their systems ... I 've done it that way for at least 15 years .	1
Have used through the years , Seems like ticks may be developing some resistance to it . Works for about 2 - 3 weeks . At least has proven to be safe for my pets .	1
This has 6 applications , where you use this on your dog once every month for 6 months during the summer months . It helps to kills fleas and ticks that might get on your dog . No dog should be left outside all day in the summer , because there is a bigger chance of your dog to get fleas and ticks . Take them for walks , and let them out with you , but do n't keep them out in the yard all day . They need water , and air conditioning is nice ! ! ! !	1
All pets are different as far as what works for them . This does the job for us . Fast acting and lasts for 2.5-3 months really before needing to reapply on your pet . They do n't like customers to know that but if you do your research on the active ingredients , it can save you a lot of money .	1
For my pet It did what I needed it too do it is easy to use and I would suggest it to others also just great	1
This product is a great idea . The 3pack of frontline only lasted about 3 months and cost 35 dollars . With this product I 'm able to have my dog protected for about 6 months for alot less . There is no reason that this wo n't work it 's the original front line products and it 's applied the same way except instead with a plastic syringe ( no needle ) instead of using the edge of the frontline applicator . I will buy again .	1
I 've used Frontline on my dogs ( and cats ) for years now . I had once gotten a country dog and no matter what I did , could n't get rid of the fleas . Then Frontline came out and I was finally able to get rid of them.I 've used this product for at least 10yrs and have never had a problem . This year was the exception in that we had a warmer than normal winter and a very hot dry summer , so I did have to use some flea spray as well . but it is under control.ONe other thing ... . I was told by the vet that it works best if used all year long . Might be a tad pricey for that if you have several dogs ( and cats ) like I do , but if it 'll stop the problem before it begins , it 'll be worth it.Thank you.MEF	1
First time user of this product . Like the fact that all the med is in one spot instead of a long line down the back . Will be better able to evaluate after more usage as to the effectiveness . Delivery prompt .	1
I have tried other brands and they do n't seem to do the job quite as well as frontline does for my dogs . They are always walking in the woods or tall grasses and if I do find a tick it is dead .	1
Have been using this for years on my lab . It works ! ! Amazon has the best price . I live in northern Wisconsin where ticks are prevalent .	1
A month does n't go by without Dunkin and Suzee getting their Frontline . And now it 's even better getting it from Amazon at a fraction of the price of the vet , Petco , or Petsmart . And it is shipped free too ! I did find a tick once on one of them ; it was dead . I guess that 's the whole idea .	1
I have not seen a flea all summer on my dog she is small so I do n't use it every month about ever other month Frontline Plus says to use it every three months if you do n't see any fleas .	1
This seller ships very quickly and has good prices.I would n't use anything else on my Princess to eliminate fleas and ticks . Have been using this product for about 25 years and it works so well that I would n't want to change it for anything else .	1
we 've used several different brands of tick repellent . Honestly , I ca n't tell the difference . we live in the NE USA , and supposedly there are a lot of ticks in the warm months . our dog has never had a tick . I guess it works ! it seems pricey , but since we frequently go on hikes , I think its worth it . she 's not a huge fan of when we put it on her , but she tolerates it : )	1
I have tried both products and for me this one seems to work the best . It keeps fleas away and ticks . I also use this with the Vibrac Preventic Tick collars . Before I started using this and the Preventic Collar , I was always finding ticks on my dogs . 5 and 6 at a time and they would be totally engorged by then . Now , I may find one or 2 baby ones on them , but get them before they can really bite the dogs , because something in this product repels them , so I really am a believer in this . I totally have seen the difference and ca n't live without it . I stock up on it because it runs out of stock often .	1
Everyone who owns pets has to purchase these products . The thing that was great is they were so much cheaper online than usual ... even cheaper then the so called & # 34 ; pet product & # 34 ; websites .	1
The new packaging was a bit hard to get open but the product itself is still the reliable product we have come to love .	1
We have used frontline plus for seven years now and swear by it ! Some other reviews said they received a product that was made outside the U.S. and the box numbers did n't match the batch numbers on the product . This was not the case for the ones they sent us . I am very happy with the swift shipping and quality of the product !	1
My dog is very prone to ticks especially , and this works very well for keeping fleas and ticks off of her .	1
This really works for my Welsh Springer Spaniel who carouses in tick ridden areas often . And a welcome condition for me and my household . Highly recommended brand .	1
This is the trusted name in Flea and Tick control and that is why we bought it . Definitely more pricey that generic alternatives but what we have been use to . Did not get the impression that this was a different manufacturer when we looked at the box .	1
This is the same Frontline that you would buy at a pet store for 3 times as much . I have two dogs so this bargain price is a must for our family . I have n't been able to find it cheaper any place else .	1
This is the same stuff my vet tries to sell us every couple of months , but at a substantial price difference.The only place that I have found Frontline cheaper has been our local Wally World , but I enjoy the convenience of ordering on Amazon .	1
We are very pleased with this purchase . We first ordered the 3 month supply and after receiving it fast and for a great price we decided to go for the 6 months supply . The Frontline Plus arrived 3 days before the estimated delivery , came in the original sealed box , same as you would buy in a retail store but for half the price ! Ca n't be any happier ! : )	1
Shipping was right on timePackage was small and secureProduct was not injured in shippingCost is well worth it	1
I 've been using the Frontline Plus on my 3 small dogs for several years . The product has kept fleas and ticks off my dogs without any side effects . They do n't react at all when I apply it . I started using it all year when I found a tick on one of my dogs in early winter .	1
Frontline is the only flea product that seems to work with my 2 large dogs . I have a boxer/lab mix and a pure black lab and they both have flea allergies . This product gives them relief and they stop itching !	1
I have two , small Westies and since they are constantly getting dirty , I wash them 2-3 times per month . After a day of being washed , I use 1/2 the for each of the dogs ( which is about 1 full dose a month ) and this does the trick .	1
It is the exact same thing I buy at my vets ... so why not get it at a better price here ?	1
Best price in town for a yearly supply . Klaus loves these chewables and I recommend them to anyone with a large breed dog .	1
Frontline is a great product , but be warned , .. This comes in a 6 month dose packet that you have to use a syringe with . We received this order today . It comes with the syringe to measure and apply it behind their shoulders like the individual packets . The company sends you a tiny 'tiny ' bottle and the directions say to put one pack of the liquid in it . We spilled over half because it is too small to fit in the TINY bottle they send . The 1.34 ml that had to be applied to our 32 lb dog meant that we had to use the syringe twice as it only holds 1.0 ml . Looking at the packet , there is no way that it contains a 6 month treatment ! We are requesting a refund ( less 1/12 as we bought 2 packages or exchange of 11 single use treatments for our 32 lb dog ) as we had to apply 1 treatment because our dog was due for it . Once we receive our refund ( or exchange ) from the shipper ( if we do at all ) , we will update the review.Same day : Amazon has sent me notice that I will receive a refund , and I got the return label to send back the unused treatments to the shipper . The only qualm being that it is in syringe form , and you have to use your own sterile container to keep the rest of the treatments in ( if you only have 1 or 2 dogs ) as the vile they send is not big enough . This is great for a multi-dog family . And the customer service is AWESOME ! I would buy from this company again .	1
I use Frontline on my dogs in the summer time to stave off those nasty ticks . It does this job very , very well . Also works to keep them flea free.In the winter I use a different brand that combats ear mites and fleas but in the summer , this is the stuff you want to have on hand . Trust me , you do not EVER want you or your pet to suffer from the Lyme disease that ticks carry .	1
This product does what it says it will do . Seems to work better than Advantage , which used to be a better product.Living in an area with fleas , it is not an option to go without protection . I had been reluctant to use this type of product but after 4 years of using it , I have found no harmful effects in my pets .	1
I 've been using Frontline Plus for about 15 years and it always helped with the ticks . Living in NJ , ticks are a big problem , especially for my dogs , as we go hiking almost daily in the woods.Amazon has a very good price for Frontline , but now that generics are coming on the market , I think next order , I will give them a try . Maybe Frontline will have to lower their price to compete .	1
Adequate flea control , though I do n't like to use chemicals on my critters . Unfortunately , Sentinel alone does n't control fleas when it 's flea season , so sometimes I need a little extra help from Frontline . My vet said it was safe to use in conjunction with Sentinel .	1
I have used frontiline with my cats for 7 years , and it still works . Their mother and sister had a very bad reaction to flea collars and flea sprays . They do fine with frontline , and as long as we give it to them once a month .	1
My dog loves this product . Buying this dog food online saved me a trip to the store , and I did n't have to carry this heavy bag in and out of my car .	1
I had stopped using Frontline a few years ago when it 'appeared ' to stop being effective on my dogs . It was on sale a couple months ago so I tried it again . I do n't what they did but I 'd say it improved as I found no sign of ticks ( or fleas ) on the pets . We are heavy with them here in Maine in the fall and so far the Frontline is doing what it suppose to . As long as it does that and does n't have an adverse effect ( which can happen ) on our pets we 'll continue to use it..	1
Frontline works . What else do you need to say ? My cocker spaniel is not as showy as the one on the package , but I love him to death and want to keep him safe , so Frontline it is .	1
This product has always worked great for my dogs . It seems to last more than 4 weeks even when my dogs swim in water . I can tell when I have forgot to follow the one month application schedule , since after an extra 2 or 3 weeks , my dog starts scratching a bit . Seems the scratching goes away very quickly once i put the next application on . Have been using this for many , many years .	1
Before I ordered this I read the review about fraudulent products . Thus , when I did order it and got it , I called Merial and they verified the product was legit . If I were you , I would do the same .	1
I purchased Frontline Plus after a recommendation from our vet . I was concerned about some issues with Advantix because I have other pets in the home ( cats , rabbit ) . Advantix is lethal to rabbits and although the chances of the two animals coming into contact with each other or the product are slim I decided it was best not to risk it . We purchased both dog and cat versions ( although our cats are indoor cats ) worried about possible critters being brought into the home from our daily dog escapades to the dog park , potty walks , etc . I have been using this product for almost a year and we have had no problems whatsoever . In fact , I have not even had to use the cat 's Frontline at all and I may be selling it to someone who actually has outdoor cats . The first thing I will mention is that I live in the city . That being said , there are craploads of bugs everywhere even though most properties in my neighborhood spray for pests . The dog park is not sprayed and there is tall grass all over for bugs like ticks to hide in . We take our dog pretty much every day and I have yet to find a single tick on her thanks to Frontline Plus . An added bonus is that it 's waterproof -- I 'm thankful for this because our dog has a new found love for puddles , mud , and wading in water . Needless to say she gets dirty and we have to bathe her often ( especially in spring ) . As with any product that can affect your pet 's health I would talk to your veterinarian about your options for pest control on your dog ( make sure there are no other health concerns , allergies to specific ingredients , what type of area you live in -- country , deep woods , city , etc. ) . Overall , I highly recommend this product.-Owner of a German Shepherd mutt mix .	1
A good product , we use it all the time , andthis was a very good price . It 's expensivestuff , but consider the alternatives .	1
This is the only product we will use for any flea problem ! does what it says it will do ! ! ! ! ! love it !	1
Package arrived on time as expected and in good condition . Have been using this product for years on our 2 poms . Have had no fleas or ticks on the since we started using it . Love the product .	1
My mom 's beloved Bichon Frise is the family pet . The grandchildren all love her and we 'd be lost without her . Unfortunately , she is highly allergic to flea bites . She also can not tolerate a flea collar . We have tried everything for this poor , sensitive dog and finally found Frontline Plus ! We apply it every 45 days because she 's mainly an indoor dog and only goes out for using the bathroom . The vet suggested every 45 days because of her sensitivities . It works wonders ! We just started using it May of this year ( 2008 ) and she has not had a single reaction to fleas for the first time in the 10 years she 's been alive.Every dog should have Frontline Plus applied to keep them flea free ! We no longer have to put her on allergy medication . It 's been such a wonderful product for her .	1
packaging was as advertised and product came as expected . Purchasing this online can be cheaper than buying ti at the pet store	1
Allow me to caveat this review by saying out of 500 plus reviews this is the most difficult to write as I despise having to use pesticides on our dogs . That said , we live in Tick and Flea central , surrounded by deep woods and our bull dogs are in every sense of the word family . That said if you 're reading these reviews your dog or dogs are your heart and using these products is a difficult choice to make , but for most of us it 's one we have to make.On that note , it 's nice to be among my own kind of folks and it 's my hope the following information has some value for you.Frontline was first put into clinical trials in 1985 shortly after the discovery of it 's active ingredient Fipronil . It has maintained the safest albeit not the most effective treatment for fleas and ticks . However , the more effective products pose a significantly greater risk to your dog.It 's a slippery slope , but in evaluating what 's best for your dog and offers the most protection at the least risk Frontline and FrontLine Plus are hands down , without question your best bet.Most tick and flea products contain Premethrin ( or related compounds ) as the active ingredient . Premethrin is a lethal neurotoxin that flows through the dogs circulatory system and flushes into every major organ - including the brain where it can do dire damage . Although thousands of dogs die every year from Premethrin and the FDA has mandated a minimal use of it not to exceed 750PPM companies continue to use it because it 's cheap and effective.What makes Premethrin so dangerous is that it ca n't distinguish between insects and mammals including human beings . It 's been known to be lethal to cats since the 1970 's . Even a slight transfer from dog to cat can result in seizures , brain damage and death.Premethrin is volatile as well - meaning it 's airborne properties pose a continued threat to all who breath it in - dogs and humans included.Frontline on the other hand uses Fipronil . Fipronil is an insecticide . Like any compound of this nature it can be lethal at too high of a dose . However studies including those from the Department of Environmental Conservation have determined time and time again that as long as the amount of Fipronil is at the correct dose for the weight and size of your dog toxicity is far easier to avoid and the product much safer for your dog.Unlike Premethrin , Fipronil is absorbed into the hair follicles and oil glands only.It is not absorbed into the dogs system nor is it volatile so you and your beloved pets and children can breath easy . The second active ingredient in FrontLine Plus is Methoprene which is a long existing and time proven IGR ( insect growth regulator ) it 's distributed exactly like Fipronil but only acts on flea and tick eggs and Larvae - this is important because it kills these vermin at the start of a new life cycle . What is more , the diseases that ticks carry now are infinitely more serious than the dreaded Lime disease - which for decades was the only concern.Competitors to Frontline ( and some Vets selling other products ) claim that fleas and ticks have become resistant to Frontline - hog wash . These pests have become resistant to most all pesticides and no independent research exists to confirm this claim . I can assure you I 've researched this in the greatest depth.The bottom line is this - all of these products pose a risk.The wise choice is to minimize that risk in your effort to protect your pet from the diseases these vermin carry . Again , these diseases can be infinitely more lethal than the ingredients of the protection . To that end your safest and most effective choice is Frontline or Frontline Plus.In the event your pet has a bad reaction to Frontline products these are the symptoms you would see : * Restlessness* Itching* Vomiting* Difficulty Breathing* LethargyShould these symptoms occur , of course take your pet to your Veterinarian or emergency clinic immediately . It should be a comfort to know that unlike the toxic ingredients in most other flea and tick control products severe reactions to both Fipronil and Methoprene are rare . What is more they can be neutralized quickly .	1
I 've use this product on my pets for years ! It does a great job of keeping the fleas and ticks off them .	1
I like the Frontline Plus because it has not caused any skin irritation with any of my dogs and works on ticks , fleas , and ear mites . Unlike some of the other products that only kill the fleas and ticks once they bite Frontline Plus stops the flea life cycle thus flea eggs do not hatch in your home .	1
We have used Frontline Plus on our dogs for years , but the price of the product at the vet or the local big box pet store always seemed high . I had never thought of Amazon as a pet supply store , but I guess you really can buy just about anything here ! When I read that there were issues with counterfeit products , I was a bit concerned . However , I saw that the product was sold and shipped from Amazon . I knew if it was n't the real deal that I could easily get a refund . The price sealed the deal . I was able to get a 6-month supply for what I had been paying for a 3-month supply ! I opened it up when it arrived , and it is the legit product . As long as Amazon is the seller , I will be buying Frontline Plus here . The product works . We live near a heavily wooded area , and our dogs have never had fleas as long as we 've used Frontline . This is a great product at a great price .	1
In all honesty , I 'd rather not use this type of chemical product on my dogs . I resisted for as long as I could but the so-called natural products were , sadly , ineffective . I was pulling off a tick a day from them and I found a few of the little suckers crawling on me . That was the last straw , so enter Frontline . Bottom line , it works better than anything else I 've tried . There 's nothing more to say about it , except if someone knows about an effective natural/less chemically product , please let me know .	1
I have used Frontline Plus on all my dogs for years . It works great on my toy poodle and bichon ; who are indoor 22/7.Now for my other dog a pitbull mix.. he gets ticks 3 weeks after I put in the application . I thought the ticks were suppose to die when they bit the dogs skin , but these ticks do n't die ! they feed on his blood : , ( it gets bad . He stays outside 16 hours a day . I dont know why front line does n't work with him . It works great with my other dogs .	1
Frontline Plus is a great product . I use it for my 6 year old pug . No fleas or tick problems and no adverse effects seen from use . I really would not use anything else .	1
Does just what it says . I live in a wooded area and my dog does pick up ticks occasionally . I usually pull them off , but if I miss one , this takes care of it . They fall off well before they get fat on her blood . This will leave a greasy spot if it gets on clothing , but it washes out easily .	1
I have always used Frontline Plus on my dogs and cats . The employees at the petstore recommended Advantix for my dogs and claimed it was better than Frontline . I gave it a shot and ew ! It smells so bad and made my dog reek . Never again ! I 'll stick with Frontline .	1
great purchase for my pet . we can go hiking with a clear conscious and I have not noticed any creepy crawlys on her .	1
Best price on the web for monthly flea and tick prevention and is very easy to measure and apply.Best practice : With four little dogs who just love to lick anything new ( and each other ! ) we administer the monthly application to the back of their necks just before putting them in their individual crates for the night . The product is distributed beneath their coats by morning .	1
I 've been using Frontline for years with my dogs . It has always been very effective , which is important living in a place with lots of ticks . After going on nature walks , it 's nice to check the dogs and not find a single tick on them . If only the same could be said for us humans : - ) .When I moved to VA , our new vet had us try another flea and tick product . One of my dogs had such a horrible reaction to it . Racing heart , panting , hyperactivity , that the vet had to give him a sedative . Needless to say , I 'm sticking with Frontline . It does the job and my dogs tolerate it well.I always purchase this product through Amazon because you ca n't beat the price ! I also make a point of choosing the 3 month supply boxes because the order is filled by Amazon . This is important to me because I know that I can count on a speedy delivery and that I receive the product I ordered .	1
My dog has never had a flea . It is easy to apply and you only do it once a month . The hardest part is getting the child resistant package open . Have a pair of scissors handy .	1
It 's so much cheaper on Amazon than in the stores and it really works . It takes a while for it to absorb- so you have to be careful not to touch your pet where you applied it- but once it is absorbed there is no odor or anything . I took my dog to a nearby park . When we got back to the car I noticed he was literally crawling with ticks- but when I went to pull them off I saw that they were all as dead as a door nail- it did n't take even half an hour for the Frontline to kill them all . I 'm wondering if something that toxic can be good for your pet , but if you have to use something it may as well be a product that works .	1
We have 8 ( yes eight ) cats and a very large dog . Frontline Plus has excellently for us for 3 years now in a very heavy flea & tick area -- Texas.IF used each month as directed I have never found fleas on our animals and 7 of them are outside much of daylight hours . HOWEVER , use EACH month . Twice I have forgotten and gone a couple of weeks over the 4 week / 31 day recommendation and each time did fine a flea or 2 on one or more animals at about 10 days overdue . My bad , not the product . Two days after application , again NO fleas could be found on the animal.I only down rate this product to 4 stars due to the applicator . It is difficult to easily squeeze out the plastic container in a smooth , quick easy manner . This can be a problem with cats who do n't like any thing wet on their skin as they tend to RUN and or fight back , probably same with small flighty yippy dogs . Also , to open both outer packaging and the pipette itself is best done with scissors , they are SECURELY packaged ! ! ! Hope Merial improves this soon , then I will give them SIX stars , or try to .	1
I never had a problem with parasites or side effects while my dog was on this . Recently , my vet switched my dog to Trifexis heartworm preventative , which contains Capstar , so I was told that an additional topical flea preventative was unnecessary , so I no longer use this product .	1
I have a healthy dog and want to keep her that way . Living out in the country , ticks can be a problem . This product works great !	1
I love frontline plus . My dog is n't exposed to fleas and ticks that often anyways . He is just a 14lb cock-a-poo . But he does play with the cat a lot and k9 advantix II explicitly states that their product is toxic to cats ( the dog formula is ) . I had to return it immediately and have been using this ever since . My dog is n't a run through the fields and woods kind of dog , however I am sure that there are fleas out in the yard or on other dogs when he goes to dog daycare . He has never had flea problems and I have been using this for about 8 months now .	1
I have used this product for years . I 've never seen a flea on my pet . If they get ticks , the ticks are dead wjen I get them removed .	1
I have five dogs at my house most days . Mine , My neighbors , My friends two dogs & her Mothers dog . I use Frontline plus on all of them with no skin problems . It is very easy to apply and We have not found one single tick on any of these dogs . Getting the product from Amazon is fast & easy and I save a whole lot of money .	1
Half the cost of 3 month front line with 3 individual packets sold in stores . Just open the large 3 dose packet , pour it into the amber colored container , draw the proper dose out of the container with the needleless syringe & apply to your dog .	1
We use Frontline Plus for flea control because it works . We started with Advantage when our Golden was younger , and that worked well , too ... but our dog likes to swim and Frontline is waterproof so we switched . She is 8 yrs old now and has never had a flea - which is amazing since we live in S.CA . near the beach where fleas abound and visit parks all the time . You are supposed to put on monthly ... I end up putting on every other month and in winter every 2-3 months ... seems to work fine with those intervals . Frontline is n't cheap - but Amazon has best price ... Our Costco started carrying it for the same price , but no tax and free shipping gave Amazon the edge .	1
My breeder is also a vet . She has used this product on her own dogs for about ten years . She feels so strongly about protecting her animals , she actually gave us some of this when we purchased a dog .	1
Living in Florida , I have used this product for years and will continue to use it . The Frontlline arrived on time and was packaged properly .	1
This is a product that I use on my two dogs and like very much . The price was a great deal .	1
Arrived promptly , as promised . Cody the Beagle has used this product for years without any issues . It works .	1
My vet recommended this product for my standard poodle . It is easy to apply , i use it once a month , there does not appear to be any negative side effects , and most importantly it works ! purchasing through Amamzon makes for a great deal on it as well .	1
Have been using Frontline Plus for years . It is a great product , keeps fleas and ticks off of my dog . Price was good , except this website tried to charge me tax on medication , which is a no no . They had the product listed as a flea collar which it is not . But to their credit they did refund me the money .	1
I live in Maine so needless to say it can be a bit buggy in the non-winter months , even in open spaces . I have been using Frontline Plus for my Great Pyrenees mix for years and have never seen a flea or tick on him- even after a day of romping through the woods and mud . He 's also never had any adverse reactions to the product . I also like that I do n't have to worry too much about my cats being around him when it 's been freshly applied . Some other brands advise against cats being around dogs recently treated with their product . Not that my dog and cats cuddle but it 's one less thing to worry about .	1
it is the product that works but price is becoming a issue with it . will contiue to use till it out prices need	1
I was so glad to have found this on Amazon . I 've been using Frontline Plus for years . When I heard the news that it was becoming ineffective in a lot of areas ( theories abound how fleas are building an immunity ) , I became nervous and switched to Advantage . However , two of my dogs ( littermates ) had a weird reaction to it . I 've used Advantage before , and my other dog had no reaction whatsoever , but the two little ones developed a horrible smell as it reacted to their skin , and they began itching and scratching furiously at the application site.So I decided to go back to Frontline . When those doses ran out , I went to get some more and was shocked to find out that my vet no longer carried it . I do n't know if he based this on personal experience , customer feedback , or what was in the media , but he stated that it was largely ineffective and they would n't be restocking . Ca n't use the oral flea meds b/c they caused horrible green bile vomiting in my dogs , so I crossed my fingers that an online source would have Frontline . Compared Amazon 's prices to Petmeds and Amazon beat them soundly . Dosed up my dogs and the scratching stopped ( they had picked up a few fleas as I was a bit lazy in getting some more Frontline and then had to have it mail delivered ) . I 'd seen another review that listed all the dangers of counterfeit Frontline , but I compared my order from Posh Poodle Dog Grooming , and everything checks out as genuine ... especially the fact that we no longer have any fleas . Very happy with my purchase , and for the fact that it still works well at killing and preventing flea infestation .	1
This is the same Frontline you buy at the pet store . It lasts for about 3 months in our area . The price is better through Amazon . The downside to frontline versus some other products is it stays greasy on the fur for about 24 hours , but a little better price than some others .	1
I switch back and forth between Frontline Plus and K9 Advantix because it seems if I use one too frequently , my Maltese starts getting fleas or bringing ticks into the house ( YUCK ) . But both of these brands actually WORK , whereas the off brand that Walmart started selling , does not .	1
Great transaction-quick shipping-I had just misunderstood that I was being sold a larger size and would need to measure it out for my small dogs . That said -it came with everything I would need and worked perfectly ! ! I am now very happy and would buy from this seller again .	1
Preface : I was n't ( and still am not ) thrilled to use chemicals on our dog . I gave in because he needed flea and tick prevention.After experiencing problems with K9 Advantix , we decided to try Frontline Plus . We have been using it for about 9 months , with no problems .	1
Basically you are buying in bulk and using the large dog vial for smaller dogs by dividing it up using a syringe to apply , so you save lots of $ $ . Great idea . the syringe is actualy easier to use than the original packaging .	1
As usual ca n't beat amazon 's price - Our dog used to come out of the woods with ticks galore . This stuff seems to do the trick . All in all , no more ticks ! Will buy more once the season starts again . 4/5 only because I still feel that this is pricey .	1
I just wish it repelled the buggers , not just killed them after they bit . Not very safe in tick town .	1
I have used Frontline for many years on my pets with no adverse reactions , only positive results.The impact of applying the product is almost immediate . I find that if you apply the product at the right time of the year , it can last several months . In warmer weather , when fleas are typically at their worst , I treat my cats and dogs in May and do n't have to reapply the Frontline until July . If your pets live outside , I would anticipate greater use of the product.It may seem pricier than other products but 1 ) it works with a single application and 2 ) in my experience , one dose lasts several months . I was pleased to find the product on Amazon . I have purchased Frontline through Ebay but I no longer do this do to the frequent sale of fake products and the cost savings is not really substantial . You could save a buck using Ebay but be taking a big risk . The product may not be legitimate or could be expired . In addition to these risks , sellers use not so customer friendly practices . Frequently , if you are purchasing Frontline for dogs , the Ebay sellers will sell you a large vial of canine Frontline and tell you to divide the large vial into three or six portions . So do n't bother with it.The substance can leave a slightly greasy appearance in the spot of application . This does not really bother me . My pets , all former strays , are never going to be in a beauty pageant.The product I received from Amazon was exactly like that offered through my vet and I will purchase through Amazon again in the future	1
This was the easiest way to purchase this product & I 've used it for years .	1
Just make sure you 're getting what 's advertised . Rumors have been going around that some contaminated products have been killing animals . This did not hurt my dog , and it did help with fleas , so I guess I am one of the lucky ones .	1
I like to support my local vet , but with very recently moving and money just a bit tight , I ordered this from Amazon . Even when we lived in the desert , I would treat my dog with this and heartworm medication . You never know when you may just pop up to the mountains so why not be prepared ? Now that we live in WA , it 's definitely dumb NOT to treat your dog . Good price for this stuff , will purchase again from Amazon .	1
This has been my product of choice for all my Labs over the years . Have never had a flea problem . I will say that one Lab got a tick-born disease , and I wonder if I let him swim too soon after applying it . I am extra-careful now to make sure I wait 2 days before letting him swim after it is applied .	1
Take it from me , I am a vet tech ... dogs are my business ... use this , but be sure to apply to skin..not fur . WORKS GREAT ! !	1
Only had to use this for 3 months and our dogs were cleared away ! We do not usually have fleas by us so this got rid of them quick enough !	1
I live in a wooded area , lots of woods , and wild life so fleas and tick especially abound . Using this as directed on the package , neither of my dogs has ever had a flea or tick problem .	1
Frontline works great and we use it year round on all our pets , since we live in the South . It is great to be able to buy it without having to make an extra vet trip ( which always costs $ $ ) .It also is only toxic to insects not mammals , so you do n't have to worry about poisoning your pets , like with some other products.Ca n't go wrong with this very well known product .	1
I have always used Frontline PLUS ! It is effective and easy to use . I recommend this product for adult dogs . Naturally , follow directions and the advice of your vet !	1
Our puppies spend most of the time of the time indoors so when they do go out we want to make sure they bring nothing bad back in . We have racoons , squirrels , bobcats , coyotes and many other critters that are bound to bring bugs around but for seven years of using Frontline we 've never found anything on our puppies.We order the 6 pack and spread it out over a year for our 20 lb mutt and 35 lb Corgi .	1
We have used Frontline Plus for several years on our dogs and never had an issue . Never seen a single flea or tick on them . I have a lab who loves to dig and roll around in the grass and sand , and I have n't had any problems . Last year we decided to try the new generic equivalent to save a few bucks since we are buying for 2 dogs . BIG mistake . We pulled off several ticks . As soon as we could , we went right back to FP and have n't looked back . It is worth the little extra money ( there is not THAT huge of a difference in price ) to be sure our dogs are safe from fleas , ticks and all the other nasties out there .	1
Easy to apply topically . I have always had success with Frontline protecting my Shih Tzu from pests , fleas , etc . I would recommend this to other pet owners .	1
I have used Frontline since the days before they added the Plus ( and Revolution was still years away from coming onto and leaving the market ) ... ... This product was priced much better than in stores and works flawlessly . I will keep using until a time-tested , confirmed , more effective product hit the market .	1
Works great and is safe to use on my dogs and some have very sensitive skin . It takes 3 applications ( 3 months ) to completely kill the fleas .	1
I have used Advantix and Front line plus , I belvie I have better results with Front LIne PLus . We have 4 large indoor dogs and no flea or tick problems to report . IF you follw the directions , front line will work for at least two months .	1
my dog had fleas and frontline plus eliminated them . what can i say but it works as advertised . my package arrived fast and on time from amazon . the units were in lbs unlike some others have complained about the product . i have no complaints as the price was right too , unbeatable . i will order again and recommend highly .	1
The dogs if they could talk would say they love it I think . Especially in the height of the flea and tick season they do n't scratch at all . Amazon has the best price , although having to buy a 6 month supply is a hit at one time . Will continue to buy from amazon at long as they sell it .	1
I only use half a dose on my smallest dog and the flea control lasts and lasts . I like that it controls ticks and mosquitos , too .	1
We have to buy these to keep fleas and deer ticks off our English Setters , and this is easier by auto-order on Amazon ( I just set an order to come every 3 months and forget about it ) . Otherwise , it 's a trip to the vets which is much much more expensive to buy there .	1
easy to order , arrived quickly and works well on my Border Collie , who is exposed to ticks in the German forests	1
I used this product last summer . My dogs only had a few fleas , and I wanted to make sure it was stopped before it became a problem . The Frontline drops did a great job at flea control . The fleas disappeared very quickly and did not come back . My dogs are indoor dogs , and they are not outside very much . We do n't need aggressive flea control . I only had to use it twice in two months , and the fleas did n't return .	1
I 've been using this product forever , just with different size dogs . I have never ever ever had a single flew on my dog while using this product .	1
I have been useing this for years and there has not been any flea infestations at my house the entire time .	1
I bought a Great Dane puppy who ended up having mange all over his head . I applied frontline and within a day the mange started clearing up . Within one week from the original application the mange was gone . I applied the frontline in between his should blades ( not on his head ) .Another one of my Great Danes I had purchased was covered in ticks ( literally hundreds ) when I brought him home from the breeder . I used frontline on him as well and within one day the ticks were falling off . He had ticks all over his head , paws , belly , back , everywhere ... and after applying frontline that evening , I could see the ticks falling off of him by the next morning.Frontline has worked well on all of my dogs and I have used it for many years .	1
This is a no brainer , less than MSRP and exact same product as sold at the vet . Easy application . Make sure you dont pet the dogs back or shoulder after application dries which takes some time . It is a little oily and easy to forget its there .	1
great stuff , good price . highly recommend this brand -- seems to do the job on my dog . not much savings on multi-month stock	1
I 've tried some of the major competing brands in an effort to save a few bucks , but Frontline continues to provide the best results for fighting fleas ( on my three beagles and two cats ) .Last year , Frontline helped eliminate a flea infestation on my cats , when used in conjunction with other flea control solutions throughout my house . This year , we adopted three beagle puppies that were covered with fleas when we got them . Used Frontline again , at the recommendation of our vet , and the fleas were wiped out before they had a chance to re-infest our home.Continuing to use Frontline now to maintain our & # 34 ; flealessness & # 34 ; . I do n't think Frontline Plus is perfect ( It 's expensive and does n't seem to always last a full month ) , but for my pets , it 's the best available and none of them display any adverse reactions to it .	1
I have been using Frontline Plus on my dogs for years now and they have never had a flea or tick problem . I recommend it to all dog and cat owners for flea control .	1
I have been using this on my dog since he was a puppy at the instruction of my vet . It seems to work reasonably well as he has never had any problem with fleas or ticks that I could see . The product is easy to apply although the packages are sometimes a little bit difficult to open . It also seems to cause my dog 's skin to itch slightly as he will always start rubbing his back against the carpet when I put it on each month . Generally , it seems to be doing its job , however . If you buy it in a pet store like PetSmart it is sometimes $ 20 more than it is here on Amazon .	1
This is the only flea and tick control I buy . I have tried the cheap stuff but it takes forever to & # 34 ; soak in & # 34 ; or whatever it does . This stuff goes away quickly and works perfectly .	1
We 've used Frontline Plus for several seasons now and find it to be very effective . We live on fifty acres surrounded by fields and woods so think our environment is a good test for this product . Very happy with it and will continue to use as feel it 's safe and effective .	1
I just received my order today 3/18/2013.The box Does Have 6 Individual Doses.This is what it says it is .	1
I saw Frontline Plus at PetSmart for twice what I paid here . ( $ 62 for 6 months , large dog size ) This product is great-I have used it for years . Last year I ran out , and noticed fleas on my dog . I got Frontline Plus and they were gone quickly , and a few dead ticks were found in the house too ... I live in Virginia , and although my dog is not outside much , I will keep this on hand for monthly use spring to fall .	1
If you use Frontline this is a good choice -- my Vet switched my dog to Revolution which I like a lot more -- easier to apply and dual purpose	1
When frontline first came out it was strong enough that 1 dose would last on one of my dogs for over two months , it 's not that strong anymore it seems . It does however , work really well . I want to use it specifically because it kills fleas as eggs and adults . It will help with ticks but they are very hard to get rid of . I get this size pkg and divide it up between my 8 dogs who range in size from 22lbs to 90 lbs . My vet gave me a syringe to get the liquid out of each of the vials and advised me on the correct dose for each dog . It really saves money !	1
i verifed with multiple sources online . this is not the knock off verison that other customers wrote about . have been buying this and using it for months . works the same as the kind i was getting from the vet . way less expensive .	1
I use Frontline Plus every month on my 25 pound mutt and so far it has worked perfectly . She has had no flea , tick , or lice infestations whatsoever . In fact , I 've witnessed ticks jumping on to her and then jumping or falling off soon after without attempting to burrow beneath her fur . The chemicals in Frontline Plus are absorbed into the dog 's skin and are very effective . I do n't like to think about how they might be harming the dog ... .she seems not to notice the monthly application or the slight chemical smell .	1
This product is suggested to many dog owners by the Vets . If your dog 's skin can tolerate it then it is one of the best deterrent for Flea and Tick Control . However , there are others available that may last longer , IF the skin can tolerate them . If you own a dog that has very long hair ASK your Vet . OH BOY ... If you own a puppy 3month to 9month , MAKE SURE YOU CONSULT the Vet you will be using ! !	1
We 've been using since last summer season , getting nice/good results , it works great . Strongly recommended , mainly during hot periods of day/night ...	1
Many of my friends say Frontline does not work against fleas or ticks in their area any more , so have switched to other flea/tick control brands . Well , it still works for my dogs , though we really do n't have many fleas where we live in the desert . I mostly used it when we lived in an area where ticks were prevalent . I use it on the dogs only about every 3-4 months , just in case , as I do attend dog shows , and do n't want to bring any visitors home with me ... Be aware that studies show that Frontline can be detected on humans ' hands weeks after applying to the dogs ... so wash after petting . ( Advantage showed transfer to humans for even longer periods of time , and that is imidacloprid , so would never use that product . )	1
Works really well and does last for a full 30 days . Easy to apply . Dogs do n't mind , at all . Will continue to use this product .	1
great , easy to use , snap off top and on the dog in seconds . no pain , no rash , no side effects of the dog .	1
I 'm training a puppy and he LOVES this . I got the liver flavor . My only complaint is that it does n't last long , so it 's a pricey & # 34 ; treat & # 34 ; . It fills the kong toys well - put through the smaller bottom hole and use the toy to bend the nozzle and it fills up the toy nicely w/o mess . It 's cheapest on Amazon ( from what I 've seen so far ) . But my pup has this polished off in no time at all , so it 's only a short break while he 's busy with the kong ... I 'll only use this for special rewards in the future	1
I bought this not to use in a Kong but to help my dogs take their medications . Just a little bit on the pill and down it goes ! PS : I fill my Kongs with yogurt and kibble and freeze and my dogs love them .	1
My dogs love the flavor of this paste . I put it inside the Kong ball and we have hours of peace from our 55 pound American bull dog . It keeps an otherwise very active pup ( and sometimes annoying ) busy so we can do something other than entertain her .	1
Great for any kind of stuff toy . Put your toy in the freezer after you 've stuffed it to make it a little trickier for your dog to empty it.I do n't know that I 'd use it with an overweight dog -- lots of calories . There is a reduced calorie version for Senior dogs , but it 's not always to easy to find.Look around and you will be able to find the regular flavors in bulk for a much better price .	1
At least my dogs think so . Not bad . The end tends to get crusty if you dont use it every couple of weeks	1
Dog loves taste , but works better in old bones than a Kong dispenser , was packaged well , would buy again , trying other flavors	1
All 3 of our dogs love the various vitamin-enriched `` tasty pastes '' available through Kong . Although they loved to chew on their Kongs before , we found that they really got into it once we started inserting some of the paste into the Kong cavity . All of them go nuts when we put down the `` pasty Kongs '' for them to enjoy - and enjoy them they do ! I would highly recommend all of Kongs ' `` tasty pastes '' - it 's easy to use , does n't seem to make a mess , and is a great extra treat for dogs . Our 3 give it `` 2 paws up '' !	1
I 'd order it again . Easy to stuff inside the Kong and healthy enough . The most important thing is that my dog goes crazy for it !	1
Used peanut butter for 14 years , but had to stop due to a penaut allergy in the family . This is more expensive than the jumbo jar of peanut butter , as an alternative for health reasons , it is great . My 2 labs love it ! !	1
My dog and Puppy love it . A small amount goes a long way . ( follow directions will keep it under control )	1
Our dog does not love peanut butter ( yeah , she 's a little strange ) , but she sure does like this liver goo from kong . It 's not cheap , but the amazon price was as good as I 've seen plus free shipping .	1
& # 34 ; Joanie & # 34 ; loves Kong Stuff N Paste on her Kong ball , it helps get her started licking and then trying to get all the treats out of it . She has learned to drop her Kong ball over and over again on the floor and that helps treats come out too !	1
Our puppy loves this paste . We stuff in a regular puppy kong , sometimes as a sealing for other food and some times by itself .	1
My dog loves this ! I squirt in in or on her toys when she 's done something to deserve at treat . She wiggles her whole body when she sees the can . It 's easy to use , and the & # 34 ; wand & # 34 ; at the top is long enough that you can put it slightly inside a Kong so that the dog can spend some time licking it out . I like to put this inside a Kong and then chill it in the freezer for several house . I live in Texas , so my dog loves this when it 's really hot ( all summer ) .	1
Best of all , in addition to my dog living it , is that the liver paste flows out smoothly and the amount put into the Kong can be controlled easily .	1
I bought this because it 's a tad more affordable than Natural Balance 's food roll . I cut this roll up into bite size pieces and use it as a positive food reward when training my dogs . Much to my suprise , both my cats LOVE this stuff as well so I crumble a bit of it into their food and they gobble it right down . My eldercat is thin and I have a hard time keeping weight on her , and she will just about do back flips for this stuff . Came as a huge shock to me because she only likes sweet , creamy treats like cream and yogurt . Anyway , 4 lbs cut into cubes will last you a pretty long time , and when fed as treats wo n't cause your animal to have gastric upset.. atleast not mine . 2 thumbs up !	1
Good high value treats , at a good price . My german shepherds are more attentive . I would only rate it higher if it were organic .	1
My dogs ( and one or two cats ) love this stuff . It is easy to serve . Great product . I order this regularly	1
Previously I had fed our Lhasa other brands of food rolls in different flavors but after trying Redbarn Food Rolls , our four-legged companion voted her favorite flavor as Redbarn Beef . I alternate morning and evening food between the food roll and kibbles . The 4-pound food rolls are so easy to store in the fridge and for long-term in the freezer . I slice a whole roll into 1-inch slices and then halve them before dividing into two containers - one container for every day and one container in the freezer for future use . I stick with the Zukes Mini Treats ( all flavors ) for bribes and training treats . The food roll is boxed with bubble packing and arrived within a day or two after I placed my order .	1
My dogs like this almost as much as the Red Barn chicken and liver roll . THIS FOOD FORMAT IS VERY CONVENIENT FOR STORAGE AND FEEDING . Price is good and even better with 15 % off by subscription . Check the labels - Red Barn is better quality ingredients than the higher priced Natural Balance food rolls .	1
Great for hand feeding and treats and it 's also considered a complete meal . There is too much filler though for me to use other than a training treat . Ca n't beat the price though . For what it is , you still get more than you pay for .	1
The kids love this food ~ as a treat or meal . They keep going back to their bowl to look for more.I love the fact that Red Barn has never had a recall ~ great job Redbarn !	1
This product looks like a giant salami . My dogs adore it . The amount of product it yields is ENORMOUS . It is a great value . I put myself on the `` subscribe '' program , because I want to make sure we never run out . Tucker and Capone # my dogs # say , `` Do n't think about it . . . BUY some ! ''	1
Chopped into small squares , this is a great high value reward for training . My german shepherd loves it and performs better when this is her reward .	1
As far as I can tell ... this is top rate dog food . I was happy its made in the USA . I would NOT buy my dog anything made in China , Mexico , or Brazil..to name a few . The low price seemed to make it all most too good to be true ... and it 's a 4 lb roll . The real perk with this is that my vizsla , Camille , LOVES this food ... above all others . She 's had California Natural , Merrick , Beyond Grain , Blue Buffalo and several others and she has not like any of them like she does this one ... which initially worried me ! I though , if she likes it THAT much , it must be bad for her ! But I researched EVERY ingredient in the food that I did n't recognize . I wo n't put ANYTHING into my dog that has any kind of chemicals or preservatives . Well , some preservatives are ok ... some are n't . I found every ingredient in this food passed my rather rigorous standards . It 's a very large , heavy roll of food ( 4 pounds ! ) which last a long time really . They eat around a inch I think 2 times/day , depending on their size . Camille is around 38-40lbs . They eat less of this than commercial dry food because it does n't have a lot of by-products.If anyone else has any different views on this food ... or experiences with this food ... PLEASE let me know ! ! Pam LeachRockland , ME	1
Yes , this is another great dog treat . You dog will love it . Just do not mix with kibble because your dog will quickly begin to separate treat from kibble and will leave you with a pile of kibble on the floor in order to just enjoy the treat .	1
I love this Redbarn product , and my dogs love it , too . My dogs are on a raw food diet and I try to stay away from junk treats . I cut this roll up into training sized pieces and it 's amazing at keeping their attention . It 's not as oily as other rolled dog food I 've tried , so that 's a huge plus .	1
I first bought the Redbarn Food Rolls to supplement the & # 34 ; weight maintenance & # 34 ; dry food I was feeding my 2 miniature poodles . The dry food had been recommended by the breeder . The dogs LOVE both the Redbarn Beef and Chicken & Liver rolls ! I found too , that the ingredients actually surpassed the nutrition supplied by the dry food and contained less calories than the dry food . I still use the Redbarn as a supplement , giving each dog one half of a 1/4 & # 34 ; slice morning and again at night . They each first devour their share of this product and will later go back to finish the dry food .	1
The dog food is excellent . My Akbash and Anatolians Love It ... however the problem is finding it , and the shipping is as much as the actual product !	1
My dogs ( 2 Dachshunds , a Chihuahua and French Bulldog ) LOVE RedBarn Beef Dog Food Roll . And I love feeding it to them and here 's why:1 ) It is MADE IN THE USA and contains NO corn or soy . The Lamb and Rice flavor is wheat free as well . Dogs can have or develop allergies to corn , soy or wheat.2 ) It is cooked in the casing for less nutrient loss and specially prepared and packaged without oxygen so that it will remain fresh at room temperature without the use of artificial preservatives such as BHA , BHT or Ethoxyquin.3 ) It is 93 % digestible which means less dog poo and fewer cleanups.4 ) It is a complete and balanced meal , but it can also serve as a protein supplement when mixed with dry food.5 ) When cut in cubes , they make wonderful treats and training aids ( yes , dogs find them that yummy ) .6 ) In a pinch ( when I am out of Greenies pill pockets ) a cubed piece can even be used to hide pet medications.Once you have sliced open the roll , you must seal and refrigerate the unused portion . I usually cut the entire roll into 1 '' slices and then cube the slices . A cubed roll fits perfectly in aRubbermaid 10 cup containerfor storage in the refrigerator.ADDITIONAL INFORMATION YOU MIGHT FIND USEFUL : The RedBarn manufacturing plant is located in Great Bend , KS and their corporate offices are located in Long Beach , CA.SHELF LIFE : 12 months .

my prairie dogs are zombies to this hay , cant get enough , rabbits dont care for it , chinchillas love it , guinea pigs are meh on it . but if you have a prarie dog this is a must !	1
Our little ones are thriving and enjoy a mix of this hay as well as others . No problems with short strands with this variety , unlike some other brands I 've read about .	1
All of Oxbow products are excellently made . I believe the food I buy from them is the reason I have happy and healthy guinea pigs throughout their lives .	1
This is our two guinea pigs favorite hay . They also get orchard grass and timothy hay , but this always disappears first .	1
My rabbits really like oat hay and oxbow usually has the freshest supplies of hays . If you 've never tried this hay get some for your rabbit and he/she will be very happy with it . My vet told me that I could feed my kids OATS , which they love , but just about everytime I feed them a tsp of oats , which I only do , occasionally , it tears up their tummies . The oat hay NEVER causes digestive problems .	1
I always bought kaytee timothy hay and i decided to try another brand and was glad i did i do think the oxbow hay is a much better hay . But honestly the cheapest place to get hay would be from a farm .	1
I had to put my Golden retreiver on a diet as he is getting old and his hips are giving out.I have been using this product for about a year and it has provided some improvements in dog 's weight.I do n't think he likes it as much the more fattening moist food I was feeding him , but he has gotten used to it.Honestly , I sometimes sweeten his dish with some home cooked chicken ( skinless , boneless and de-fatted ) .	1
... .I do n't really like this dog food , but my little toy fox terrier surely does ... ... I plan to keep her on this pro plan , as she does so well on it ... ...	1
My dogs love this product . It 's a step up from regular dog chow and I have seen a difference in my dogs coat being healthier	1
Outstanding dry Toy Breed Formula ! Dogs love it ! Both my dogs dig into the bowl , they love this food ! 5 Stars	1
Love this food . I have finally found a weight management dog food that doesnt taste like card board to my Goldens . They love it ! !	1
It is an excellent dog food . My chihuahua loves it . The pieces are very small and easier for a small breed dog to eat . No regrets purchasing it here . It was highly recommended to me by breeders I know .	1
My dog loves this food . I 've spent hours comparing dog foods and prices between the cheap & # 34 ; grocery store & # 34 ; brands and the very expensive brands and I find this to be a good middle ground since we are on a budget . Small bites are perfect for my lhasa / maltese .	1
I 've used Pro Plan in the past with good results , but got away from it once my last yorkie past away and times got tough financially . Eventually I got a new Yorkie , a spunky spindly thing , that loves to eat but hates eating dog food . I tried different formulas of different brands , some expensive , some cheap , but mostly stayed with Purina One with the extra meat bits because my Yorkie and my Chiweenie enjoyed the meaty bits . However , once the meaty bits were gone , the dry kibble stayed forever and they would graze on it from time to time . For little dogs , this meant they were constantly needing to go poop.Enter Pro Plan . I picked this dog food up on a whim since I was already in a pet store . Both my dogs fell in love with the dog food immediately . They would eat their portion in one sitting . ( Mosty , the Chiweenie would leave a small amount behind to snack on later . ) My Yorkie , my picky eater , cleaned out his bowl - crumbs and all.What happened next surprised me.My spindly , springy-legged Yorkie filled out . I 've been trying to get this dog to gain weight since he was a adult puppy . Nothing I fed him , from cheap to expensive , ever made him gain weight . I figured finally it was his natural genetics . He was n't sickly or lacked energy , he just was a skinny dog . However , since he 's been eating Pro Plan Focus Toy Breed Formula , he eats his full portion and he 's filled out nicely so he 's not so spindly anymore.Another thing I notice is that my Yorkie would vomit at least twice a week . This has completely stopped.As for my Chiweenie ( a Chihuahua/Dachshund mix ) , who is built more like a Chihuahua style tank ; I was concerned that she would grow fat with Pro Plan . Nope . Not at all . She 's has stayed fit and trim.Another benefit : With them eating on a controlled schedule , I 've been better able to manage their potty habits and have eliminated nearly all potty accidents inside the house . What a huge relief that has been ! I 'm now ( re ) sold on using Pro Plan again for my dogs . It 's a bit pricier , but for benefits I 'm reaping , it 's worth it .	1
My sister rescued a grayhound and wiggles just loves this food and the loving new owners she has . Win Win	1
I have fed my cats Wellness for a long time . They like it . I wish you had a variety pack of the Wellness Canned Cat Food . I like to rotate what I 'm giving them so they do n't get finicky and picky.The package arrived in great condition and when it was expected . They gobbled the chicken/herring up !	1
When I feed my cat healthier food it 's very noticeable in his coat . Already starting to see a difference . Glad I found this product and plan to keep ordering going forward .	1
I have been feeding my cats Wellness Food for four years now.What I like most is that , like most of the Wellness line , this Chicken and Herring blend is made without grains . Cats are obligate carnivores , meaning they only need meat ... in the wild they only get grains in the stomach of prey they eat . If you put grains in food , cats continue to eat until they 've had enough protein . So the grain is just added calories for nothing . Since grains are cheaper per ounce , it 's a great way to save the manufacturer money , but it 's not good for your cats.In the first year after switching from dried food and lower-quality grain-filled wet food , both my cats lost weight and their fur became softer and shinier . The difference was most evident in my plump , dumb inactive cat ; he lost a couple of pounds and went from middle-aged dumpy to sleek and active . He has gotten a lot smarter and is more lively in general.I also like that this food does n't have any rendered animal fat or meat byproducts , which are disgusting slaughterhouse waste it is illegal to sell to humans.As far as how my cats feel , they think this is just okay . They would give it three stars for the smell/taste . They always prefer the cheap stuff , like fancy feast , because it is swimming in rendered fat which smells delicious to cats just like potato chips do to humans . I call it `` kitty crack . '' Cats choose food mainly on smell , not taste , which works great in the wild but not so much with commercial foods where their quality sensor is way off . To get my cats to eat this food at first , I needed to mix it with kitty crack -- first only a quarter good to 3/4 kitty crack and gradually building up to 100 % over about six months . It 's never a good idea to get into a battle of will with cats ... first of all , you 'll lose , and second it is not safe for them to go more than 24 hours without food because of potentially fatal liver issues.After the initial break-in period , my cats ate this happily . This is the favorite of both my cats , followed by Turkey/Salmon blend as second favorite . I buy a variety to mix it up nutritionally and to make sure they do n't get too fussy . Since they never overeat this , I simply feed them as much as they want ... if they ask for more , I give it.One can is enough to feed one cat per day . This size must be opened with a can opener and stored in between uses . For this reason not as convenient as the 5.5 ounce sizes which you just pull open , but the cost difference over a year is substantial . It 's not too much of a pain as on days that are n't too hot I leave this on the counter at room temperature between feedings . If for any reason it 's not done by bedtime I put it in the fridge . Cat 's digestion is much faster and a bit of bacteria in food is less likely to cause problems.Cost-wise , these are about $ 2 a day , and Amazon 's price is competitive with big-box pet food stores . When I first started using this , the price seemed prohibitive so I took out the calculator and did a serious analysis . Compared with the Fancy Feast I was buying at a big-box store , per ounce this is a LOT more expensive . But then I realized that since Fancy Feast is packed with grains and junk cats do n't need , comparing price by weight is n't fair . I redid the analysis based on daily servings of protein , calories etc . and the two foods turned out identical in cost . It would still be cheaper to feed dried food but if I 'm going to go 100 % wet the price of this is actually comparable to supermarket foods.Wellness also sells a Core brand which is even higher quality , but it does n't come in the larger more economical cans , making it prohibitively expensive.Note : I read the one star reviews from here . Looks like there have been some quality-control issues with a new plant . I have not experienced this issue ... the quality appears the same in the 4+ years I 've been buying this . However , I will post if I experience a problem and update my review immediately .	1
One of the best wet food for your cat . Wet food is good for your cat because it gives them more water that they just do n't get from dry food . I take one can of food and add one can of water mix and give 200 ml . This gives him enough water , plus the dry food ( wellness core ) I feel I give my cat the balance of food he needs .	1
This stuff is great . The cats love it ( all flavors actually ) , and since eating it their coats are softer , shinier , with less dandruff .	1
There is no doubt in my mind that this is a great high quality food . However , my cat only eats it when it is fresh . If I put it in the frig he wo n't touch it . So I recommend it to people with more than one cat . My Mom has 5 and they love it .	1
My cats eat it that is all I can say . I try and buy the best food available but we cat owners can only say our cats eat it or will not eat it . What my cats really like is just tuna you by at the grocery store but I use this only for a treat . They eat hard food primarily and I use the more expensive brand .	1
I really like the idea of feeding my cats grain free food . I bought multiple of these little cans in different flavors for a taste test , and the Chicken and Herring definitely won with both cats . Now it 's their regular meal	1
It 's okay , the cats will eat it , but they are not crazy about it . We have 4 cats , and 1 will not eat it , other 3 will eat it only if I spinkle some frozen fish treat on top.Ingredients seems fairly healthy .	1
I just love this brand . I feet my 3 cats this all the time . I usually give my cats this flavor as well as the turkey http : //amzn.to/1eUx6Wd or the chicken flavor . They love these flavors and I love that it is made with good quality ingredients and it is grain free . I 've even gotten the rest of my family to give it to their pets and they all approve .	1
this food is great if your cat does n't have any issues like itchy skin or tummy issues . If you have a cat with skin or tummy issues , it 's time to get rid of the chicken and try a new protein , like rabbit . All of my cats have really enjoyed this food , despite having some unbeknownst to me , chicken issues . I have switched one cat to nature 's logic rabbit with tremendous success and plan to put the other two on it as well to give them a break from this food ( anything chicken ) , but if it were n't for that , this and the turkey version have been big hits in my house , including the cat that has tired of other brands of food quickly in the past . Per Dr. Becker 's protocol , I 'm going to give their systems a break from chicken for a few months and then slowly transition them back , hopefully keeping them all itchy and dirty litter box feet free .	1
My 3 Maine Coon cat ( huge cats ! ) would die without this particular blend of Wellness if it disappeared . It is their less healthy treat , but still much more healthy than any of those old school branded canned foods at Walmart/Target/the Grocery Store ( including Hills and Science Diet ) .Look up how to feed an obligate carnivore and how to calculate the actual dry matter protein matter of a food and its importance compared to these indigestible unnecessary fattening carbs . Cats are not dogs . The have never evolved to eat our scraps , and therefore they ca n't use things like corn , wheat , or even the fruits/sweet potatoes/potatoes . This has the more healthy fillers ( no corn or wheat ) and a much more competitive dry-matter protein content compared to most brands . Also , there is cranberry which will definitely help your older cat 's bladder/UT system .	1
I have since changed the brand of canned cat food I feed my cats , but I still do rotate this in their diet as this is the only grain free option that is sold where I live I do buy it when I am unable to get this on amazon . My cats love it and it is very moist , lots of water content and chock full of fatty oils that made their coats Shiney and reduced my cats shedding after the first two weeks of feeding .	1
Wellness is a great cat food that my kitties just love . I chose this brand for its natural ingredients . Two of my cats have issues - one with diabetes and one with obesity . I needed a cat food that is grain free ( for the fat kitty ) and low carb ( for the diabetic kitty ) . If you need a cat food that is not loaded with byproduct garbage , then Wellness is a great choice .	1
Love this product ! ! ! My old dog has been taking this human grade form of Cosamin DS for years and it 's kept his joints limber . It 's cheaper to buy the human grade than it is the pet grade for him . I like this seller and as long as the prices stay reasonable I 'll stick with ordering from them . I also give him Earth Animals holistic : & # 34 ; Aches/Pains drops directly into his mouth 2 x a day to ward off any pain from old age . ( do n't give your pets drugs that will destroy their organ 's ) He 's doing great ! Hope this helps someone else .	1
My orthopedist suggested I take this product as I have osteoarthritis and the joints in my hands hurt . I have just begun , so I can not critique the product as yet .	1
I have been taking the CosaminDS brand for several years now , these seem to have better quality ingredients and are far easier to digest .	1
I love this product and can tell if I skip a few days by accident . I am much more mobile and have little to no pain in my knees when I take it regularly.I am an archaeologist and rely on my knees and legs ( ok , an old archaeologist , but still kicking ! ) ... Cosamin helps me feel better and keep up with my work without having to rely on younger knees to do the things I want ( and love ) to do myself .	1
this was recommended to me by my sports DR . I stopped taking it once and noticed a big difference . The capsules are the way to go - much easier to swallow than the tablets .	1
ca n't say whether or not these do anything for her hips or not , but she sure doeslove them , gets one every morning when she comes in from getting paper with Daddy	1
My dog loves these treats and I love the idea that they could prevent future hip problems . One a day hopefully will keep the vet away . Zukes is good stuff	1
My shih tzu loves these ! I 've noticed increased mobility and less growling when he 's touched in sore spots . Will keep buying these .	1
My two doxies love these joint treats . Good quality product ( without preservatives ) at a good price . I break them in half as a night-night treat .	1
Our German Shepherd , Gabby , is so energetic when we give her these , which is every morning . She does prefer the roasted beef Zuke 's better , but loves these , also . The vim and vigor that she gets from these are unbelievable and she is very peppy after consuming the recommended amount . I think highly of this product and believe that the ingredients make a huge difference in the well being of our pup ! She is happier , springier , and does not act like an old lady , like she used to ! Awesome stuff ! !	1
These treats are good for dogs , all natural and yummy ! My black lab loved them and went through one a day ! Hopefully they helped with her hips !	1
These treats are the best value for money I 've found while researching glucosamine for my dogs . Most treats have very little glucosamine in them , so you have to feed your pet half of the package a day to help them . These are the only treats I found with a significant amount of glucosamine in them . I have three large dogs , and I give them each two days a day . Plus , they absolutely love them .	1
My Wheaten suddenly did n't like the liquid glucosamine & chrondrotin I had been giving him . After going without for a month he was having to rest under every tree - shorter walks , longer time.I ordered these & in 2 days he was walking over 1 mile with no rest stops . Just the usual bush sniffing .	1
I really like these Zukes ( made in the USA ) treats . I break off small pieces for my 8 lb and 9 lb dogs . They like the peanut butter flavor . However , I never give them more than a whole one in a given day because of the glucosamine and condroiten . ( I believe an excess of these ingredients is not beneficial but in limited dose may be helpful . )	1
My dog absolutely loves these treats and I really feel they have helped her ! She has a congenital hip problem and now arthritis has set in . She has a very pronounced limp after laying down for awhile , but since she 's been eating these treats , we 've noticed a difference in her not limping nearly as bad . I was going to purchase another bag this past week , but the price jumped up over $ 3.00 per bag in the short time since I purchased them the first time . I ended up looking at more treats with glucosamine in them and bought something else that seemed to be a better price & she at least likes them . I really wish the price had n't jumped up so much because I would have bought more , but the difference was too much for me ! !	1
My two older dogs suffering from arthritis like these treats a lot . Whether it helps their aches and pains , I do not know , but we do what we can ...	1
My dog loves these treats , I typically try to give one a day but with all the other treats she get 's often a day or two is missed . No worry as long as you supplement the desired ingredients for hip/joint in other products or food . The treats are soft and good for dog 's of all ages , no choking worries . The nice thing about Zukes is the ingredients list is not a mile long and they do n't use meat by-products and you also do n't see a lot of strange ingredients that are common in the mass marketed products .	1
And so do our three dogs ... plus , it 's a local Colorado company ! The treats are always soft and the dogs freaking love them !	1
My dogs LOVE these . They smell like beef jerky and are very moist . He 's been eating them for the past year and it 's the only treat that gets him excited anymore .	1
My 12 year-old Rottweiler is a tripod dog as a result of bone cancer . Rottweilers are prone to hip dysplasia , but he always exhibited good hips . After his amputation , the other 3 legs have had to work harder . I had noticed a decrease in my dog 's mobility and it seemed like he was in pain . The oncologist suggested Deramaxx and told me that he would be on the medication for life . After doing some research I found these wonderful treats . I noticed a marked improvement in my dog 's mobility within the first month . Even though he is an older dog , he still gets bursts of energy and is able to run back and forth a few times at the fence when something catches his attention on the other side.Just a word of caution if you have never used these before . They should be soft and pliable , and they should bend into a slight `` U '' shape when pinched between your thumb and index finger . When fresh , they will also have a potent smell , but it is NOT offensive . I had purchased some from Amazon that were stale -- they were hard and had no smell -- and decided to keep them . My dog ate them but now he is cautious every time he has them . Next time I receive a bad batch they are going right back .	1
Our dog loves these treats and ca n't wait for his daily hip supplement ! These are great treats that are made in the USA and at a good price point . Especially if you have a dog breed with known joint or hip problems , then this is the product to get .	1
My little chi loves these treats ! ! They do n't have all those nasty fillers and I have seen a difference it makes with his joints . A bit pricey maybe , but with my little guy , one a day is all it takes . One a day is about a month 's or so worth and my little chi is worth every penny .	1
My 15 year-old 80 # mixed-breed dog had slowed down noticeably . I followed the directions on the package but did n't see much difference after 2 weeks . At the end of the third week of feeding these treats once a day Herbie started running again . At the end of the month , he is romping and playing with my other dog like he is a puppy . I just watched him take the stairs 2 steps at a time . It seems like these treats took longer to work but once they kicked in my arthritic old dog now thinks he is a strapping young man .	1
my golden has been gobbling these up , they are very good to him and i enjoy giving them to him !	1
I feed these to my dog and puppy , because they are short legged guys . I break them into pieces if I want them to do tricks . These are the only kind of treat my dogs get .	1
These tests are large . So large that we break them into 4 pieces before giving them to our 30 lb lab puppy . This makes them last longer . We consider these & # 34 ; high value treats & # 34 ; because he really , really likes them .	1
I have an older mouse and 2 older Robo hamsters with increasing difficulty moving due to arthritis . They do not make glucosamine treats for rodents and chopping these up into small pieces and giving them to my old girls has had them running on their wheels again : ) They are also better able to groom themselves now that they dont ache so much .	1
Very healthy treats for a 7 yr. old 93 lbs Doberman . He loves working for these treats , butbecause they smell so good , he pays more attention to the treats than to the commands I givehim . So he 'll do two or three commands at the same time , hoping that 's the one I want himto do so he gets his treat faster : - ) My dog has no problems with his joints , but as he gets older , I hope to prevent that by givinghim the right food and treats . He has some catching up to do for the first two years of his life , when he was abused . At age two , he only weighed 39 lbs when he was rescued . I have hadhim for five years now and have spoiled him rotten . But it 's nice to know I can do that in a healthy way !	1
I can not believe how much these treats help my older dog . She use to cry out when getting up from a long nap because she was so stiff . Since giving her 1/2 of these a day , she runs and plays like a new puppy . My neighbor could not believe it and she purchased this for my older dog . What a difference this has made in my dogs life ... thank you ! !	1
Great stuff ... who knows if it really works cause I cant ask my dog . Dogs seem to enjoy it.Price is adequate.always ships well packaged and no damage	1
These joint treats work very well for my 12-year old diabetic Miniature Pinscher . They are small enough that she is able to chew them comfortably . They help her arthritic knee joint.pain -- she 's limping less and less	1
Dogs love the taste , so at the very least it 's not a battle to get them to eat these . The product is n't as greasy as i expected ( which is a good thing ) .I love the brand , and will come back for more !	1
Our older dog has arthritis in his right hip . These had good recommendations so I purchased for him . He loves them ! Our retriever is younger but I 've given them to him also just as a preventative .	1
Approved and a nice size for times when the tiny training treats are not satisfying . It is a more substantial treat but different than a biscuit or a cookie . The flavor seems to be pleasant for our dog .	1
There is a goodly amount of treats in this bag . My terriers do not chew them so it is probably good that they are soft . Time will tell if they are good for my 13 year old cairn with 13 year old hips . Hope so .	1
Liked Zuke 's Hip Action Natural Dog Treats , roasted chicken . My dogs liked this and considered it as a treat . They seem to run about a bit better too .	1
Our dog absolutely loves these and they have made a HUGE difference in her mobility . The vet said she is beginning to get arthritis and had slowed down considerably . Once we started her on these , they helped her dramatically . She moves so much better than she used to and even runs across our backyard now .	1
My 13 year old dachshund has had a history of having back issues ( due to jumping off furniture and landing improperly ) and our 10 mo old dachshund puppy has issues with her patellas . One day , I went to pick up our 13y/o dachshund up from the boarding facility and they handed her to me directly from the kennel ( the large dogs were having puppy playtime , so small dogs were in their kennels ) . I took her outside , set her down to potty , and noticed her back legs were NOT working at all . She could n't stand because when she tried to walk , her legs would n't support her and they 'd wobble back and forth , could n't wag her tail . I was FURIOUS and they & # 34 ; did n't know what happened. & # 34 ; Totally unacceptable.After a few x-rays and several vet visits , steroid medication and anti-inflammatory meds , along with crating for several weeks to keep her confined ( so she ca n't move around and further injure herself ) , she slowly started to get better . I wanted to still make her as happy as possible , so I would carry her around and let her sit on my lap - still keeping her immobile . I know she loves treats and I want her to feel like a valued family member , but wanted to give her treats that would really benefit her and not just be & # 34 ; something tasty & # 34 ; - I wanted something that would hopefully help her bones and joints get better . I do think these supplemental treats did make a difference and I 'm very happy something like this product exists on the market for us to buy ( and not just from a vet ) .The ingredients in these are fantastic . I 've purchased other Zuke 's products in the past and BOTH of my pups absolutely LOVE them ! Hip Action items are great because I know they have quality ingredients to help with joint problems . I will keep purchasing these for my dogs to help with prevention of other problems down the road.I hope no one else has to deal with anything like what I 've experience with rehabbing my dog ( I know many have ! ) , but I hope the information I shared was helpful . Try it and see if you notice any differences in your dog ! : )	1
My lab loves anything Zukes . He will do almost anything for a piece . I 'm happy knowing it contains glucosamine because he is still young large breed and walks up and down stairs . It also smells good and is easy to break apart for training .	1
My dogs love the flavor of these . I have tried both the chicken and peanut butter and they go nuts . Though I will admit the peanut butter has a less-intense smell than the chicken for human noses . I can see the difference in the dogs ' coats almost immediately ! I highly recommend any Zuke 's products .	1
I have 4 dogs and they get their hip action treats first thing in the morning . My oldest has arthritis and one of my youngest has hip dysplaysia , so I am trying to help them all have active lifestyles !	1
I know German Shepherds have a tendency of acquiring elbow and hip dysplasia so I wanted to get something to help fight back . He seems to enjoy the taste and gets around well so it is money well spent .	1
My 13 year old dog is showing signs of joint issues and decided to try these ... .both dogs love these and they get 1 every day . They do n't know that they are good for them ... .but I 'm at ease that they are getting the glucosamine they need . Would highly recommend !	1
My golden retriever has had problems with limping in the past , but since I 've been feeding him this brand , he 's been up and running limp free .	1
These are healthy treats plus they will help my Service dog when she gets older . Seeing how she do 's alot of work for me .	1
Our dog loves it . We break it up and put it in his regular food and he really enjoys it . Zuke 's is consistent with high quality ingredients and good flavor .	1
These treats are pricey but they worked wonders for our 10 year old Pointer mix with & # 34 ; a little arthur & # 34 ; as my vet called it . Hounds are prone to arthritis and these treats lessen the pain and he is acting like he is 5 years younger . He still limps a bit but he is not as lame as before and he hardly ever yelps in pain anymore . He even started running again . They are cheaper here than at major pet stores .	1
I have an older shih-tzu who is over weight and starting to have some hip problems . We bought here these treats to hide her daily pills in . They are so perfect , they are so soft that they can squish around her pills easily . They are also easy to chop up into smaller pieces and use as training treats !	1
My dog loves these , and I feel good about feeding them to him . I have been doin very basic clicker training with him for about a year now , and I will sometime tke two of these treats and cut them into tiny pieces for this purpose . Works like a charm !	1
My 7yr old Corgi is running again ! I am so happy . He 's 35lbs with bad hips and joints . I give him one of these in the morning everyday and it has vastly improved his energy level and mobility .	1
We have tried different supplements for our 11 year old Golden Retriever but he kept having a hard time getting up . After about a week on these he is getting up a lot easier , we see a huge difference . Granted , he 's not getting up as quick as our 2 year old but we absolutely see a difference . I highly recommend this to anyone ! Update 12/3/2013 : We upped him to 5 treats a day and WOW , he is getting up a lot faster and is even walking faster . He weighs about 100 lbs and 5 seems to be the correct amount for him . If you feel like there is no benefit for your dog try upping it for a few days and see if there is a difference .	1
My dogs enjoy this treat and I like the fact it has glucosomine in it for an added nutrition boost . Great USA product .	1
I have a toy malti-poo and she is fussy about her food ! She loves these healthy treats . I hope they will keep my little puppy live a long healthy life .	1
Anything by Zukes is awesome ! Try to get it when it 's fresh though bc the package I got was pretty old and it was too tough but still great !	1
My dog has severe hip dysplasia and we give him the glucosamine-chondroitin to help that condition . He loves these treats , even though he left other & # 34 ; treat & # 34 ; -forms of this medicine in his bowl .	1
I have a senior maltese who is prone to knee problems . He began experiencing pain in his legs when jumping on and off the couch so I decided to get these for him to help with his joints . I give him one each day and I have not seen him limp or yelp in pain ever since I started giving these to him , which has been over a year . The best part is , he loves the taste of them , and when I open up the baggie , he gets super excited and starts wagging his tail and licking his lips ! I knocked off one star b/c I have noticed that some bags are not as fresh as others ( no I have n't tasted the product myself but the fresher products are softer and the older ones are harder ) .	1
I have been giving these treats to my dogs for the past 3 years or so . Never upset their stomachs and every time I say a word with `` tion '' on the end they get so excited.Great products , great ingredients and above all a very trustworthy company !	1
We have two dogs - a small one and a large one . Both enjoyed these treats , and the little one is pretty picky .	1
My boys hips are getting worse with old age , so every little bit helps . My dog loves these , and i like that it is made in the USA .	1
My dog is on a supplement for hip dysplasia but I also give her 2 of these a day for extra protection for her hips-she is very active and they seem to help .	1
My dog loves this treat and it is safe and has mild joint support for her older age ( 8 ) . It 's a great way to supplement your older dog 's diet without going through the hassle of pills .	1
I use Zuke 's Hip Action treats on my 15 year old miniature schnauzer . I noticed last year she was having trouble getting up the stairs . These were recommended by a coworker ( I work in a popular pet store chain ) over expensive pills . Now she jumps and walks normally again , her joints are n't as sore . She loves these treats and gobbles them up , even though she 's very picky . The price here is also a great value , I bought them at $ 10.99 a pound , the store I work at is $ 9.99 for half a pound , so this is a great deal ! The only con to it is that there are no preservatives so they go dry/stale very quickly , so make sure to dose daily . They 're a better deal than most supplement pills out on the market and a lot easier to feed to dogs . Highly recommended .	1
I have a finicky basenji and he loves these treats . My dogs are also getting up in years but their joints and bones remain strong . I do n't know if these treats contribute to that , but I 've been giving them to them for a long time , so maybe so .	1
My dog gets crazy when he sees the package . He absolutely loves this product . Unfortunately , the price is too high for me , so I will only buy it once in a while .	1
My dog says these are wonderful . They are moist , break into smaller pieces , if you needed that . She has no ill effects from them in anyway.There is not bad odor ; just a neutral scent . Seems like a fine treat !	1
These are like brownie moist . Great for hiding pills , etc . Both dogs loved 'em . Wish they were n't so expensive . Otherwise awesome !	1
My two mini-dachshunds love these treats . They 're made of quality ingredients , with meat listed first , and are produced in the USA . I like that they contain supplements for joint health since dachshunds are prone to spine and joint problems . The pieces are too big for my little dogs , but they 're soft and chewy so I can easily tear them apart . I 've had the same bag for about a month now since my dogs do n't get treats every day , and the treats are still nice and soft , not stale at all . These treats would probably be great for older dogs with dental problems , too , since they 're so chewy .	1
My dog goes nuts for these treats , so he gives them a huge thumbs/paws up ! In the morning I 'll say `` Hip Action ? '' and he runs around like crazy . I notice when I 'm consistent about giving them to him daily he seems to run around a little easier and faster , whereas he 's a little slower if I miss a few days . I also notice a difference in how easy/difficult it is for him to jump up on the couch or bed ( yes , he 's allowed ... I know , I know , spoiled dog ) . He and I both really like these treats , and I think they 're good for him.Updated 11/5/13 to add product info . I saw a few questions posted asking about quantity and feeding instructions , so I wanted to add my answer to one of those here in my review.In the 1 lb . bag there are about 60 treats , as noted on the back right under feeding instructions . It says `` This bag contains approximately 60 treats . '' I did n't count them to be sure , but that sounds right . The feeding instructions are : 1 treat daily for small dogs ( 46 pounds and under ) ; 2 treats daily for medium dogs ( 98 pounds and under ) ; 3 treats daily for Giant ( 138 pounds and under ) . How long the bag will last depends on the size of your dog and how closely you follow the recommended daily # of treats . I have a small dog by their definition , so if I were to follow the feeding instructions exactly as written on the bag , it 'd last my 30 pound dog 2 months .	1
Our 14-year-old was starting to get stiff in his hips . We tried a supplement on prescription , from the vet first . That really helped , but the `` treats '' were like little hockey pucks , with the consistency of jujubes . The dog did n't like them . These treats have the same active ingredients , so we gave them a try . They are great ! Our dog loves the taste and he really looks at them like treats and not like something he 'd rather hide under the rug . We matched the dose up to what was prescribed and he 's doing just fine . These are also less expensive . The only problem is keeping them away from the puppy , who also thinks they are delish . It 's awesome that these are available on Subscribe and Save ! Of course , like all Zuke 's treats , they are made in the US and the ingredients are actually food products and not by-products . We have never used a Zuke 's treat that was bad .	1
My shepherd is over 10 years old and about 109 lbs . He was limping a lot , this seems to have helped him . It took about two bags get results . The only thing I dont like about this product is it doesnt clearly tell you how much is in it . So , I have had to guess on how much to buy at one time .	1
Car insurance rates are astronomical in my city , so I gave up my car and rent one when I need to do shopping , errands , appts , etc.Run out of healthy dog treats ? NEVER ! ! ! I order them from Amazon -- one of their trusted merchants makes sure my Lulu has what she needs , on time . OR , I could spend $ 30 in gas for my rental car going to the burbs to pick up what I got ta have ! Lulu thanks you and I thank you , Amazon .	1
Now that my dog is getting old enough to be troubled by arthritis , a friend steered me onto glucosamine to help alleviate it . These are good supplements , more doggy treat than medicine . I find that glucosamine products can be surprisingly hard to find in most pet food and supply sections .	1
This are Baylee 's favorite treats . She loves the taste ( more than normal drool ) and has become very used to her daily 'allowance ' of two . Baylee has a knee an hip problem from an injury . After using and Hip Action for about a month we began to see her walk more easily and be more willing to play with the younger dog - quite a feet for a 12 year old boxer.Now we make sure she never runs out .	1
My dog absolutely LOVES these treats ! ! I think they stink so bad lol but of course he loves them . He has some arthritis issues from surgery and old age so I bought these to help him & I do believe they are helping him quite a bit . I just give him one daily so this bag does last quite a while which is great considering they are a little pricey . I think they are worth the price since he loves them and they seem to be helping . Definitely recommend !	1
I like that these are all natural and made in the USA ... My dog loves the taste and it 's a great way to give him his joint supplement ! And they are highly nutritious too ! Great product !	1
My 5 month old german shepherd/rotty loves it . Its kind of like licorice , easy to break apart but does not fall apart . Too bad it was gone in less than a week , lol	1
My dog loves these treats . I love how much more fun it is to give him glucosamine and chondroitin in a treat instead of in a pill or a liquid . These are pretty affordable , too . They also travel fairly well , and they are soft enough to break in half if you only want to give half of a treat.The only possible problem is that I worry about giving my dog too many of these a day . The package does have guidelines for how many treats to give per day based on your dog 's weight . But so far `` over-medicating '' has not been a problem ( especially if you break them in half ) .I 've been really amping up my dog 's walks and runs to get ready for hiking this spring , and so far he 's not only limp-free , but the stiffness he used to get just after a nap seems to be significantly reduced . All in all , we 're both really happy with these . I 'll be buying them again , and I 'll be trying out more of Zuke 's other treats .	1
That about sums up what happens when I break these treats out twice a day ... they are dog gone , gone , they wolf them down .	1
I have a finicky eater , but he 's never turned these down . The size is perfect so I do n't feel bad about giving an extra treat now and then , and the ingredients seem to be of good quality .	1
My dogs get these as their treat for going to their cages at bed time . They know they get them so they sprint to their cage and start drooling immediately , even before I can get them out of the bag . They love them as a treat , I love that I can take care of them .	1
These treats are one of the only treats my dog will eat ! He is very picky and love these treats ! Made in the USA with all natural ingredients these treats are good for him as well !	1
We 've always liked Zuke 's products so when looking for a glucosamine supplement , Zukes 's was near the top of my short list of candidates . I chose the Zuke 's treats because each contains 300 mg of glucosamine and because the formula contains no wheat , corn , soy , by-products , or artificials.Not everyone agrees on the efficacy of glucosamine , but I 've taken it for years with wonderful results , and our bichon with problem hips showed marked improvement while taking glucosamine.These square treats are soft and easily broken into pieces if desired . Our Piper gets a Zuke 's treat every night and eats it with gusto . When this bag has run its course , I 'll be ordering another .	1
These are great treats because of their size . I have an older dog who is slightly overweight so we have to limit her treats . These make me feel better so I do n't feel like I 'm neglecting her . I love that these will help with her older hips.These are perfect for behavior rewards & easily kept in my pocket.The dogs love them . I love that they are USA made , all natural treats .	1
I have been using Zukes for my Shihkingnese Dary for about a year . She was having difficult with her rear hind quarter.She would often skip on her rear right leg . I saw this product at a local pet boutique , and I decided to give it a try.After about a month of use , I noticed that Darby was no longer skipping . However , when I was not consistant with its use she began to skip again.She likes the flavor and considers it a treat . When I forget , she immediately reminds me that her treat is in the bed side table . When I used the product regularly , Darby did not skip.This package is much larger than the one I purchased in the boutique . It is also much more cost effective.I ordered this particular order for my Dad 's 12 year old pit , Angel , because he was worried about her mobility issues.I thought if it worked for Darby , surely it would also work for Angel .	1
So far- using 3 a day for my big puppy St Bernard- zero complaints , used as a treat and have put it in his dry dog food just to encourage him to eat his breakfast ... . : ) Happy Puppy	1
My 4 dogs love these treats and it helps their joints also so its a win-win	1
Should only rate it 4 stars , as I have n't a clue as to whether they will help her bad hips or not . I have hope	1
I have 3 spoiled dogs . Puperoni was the only pricey soft treat they 'd eat . Then I tried beef Zukes as something cheaper and different . They smell awful to me , but the dogs all grabbed these little squares and gobbled them up ... .to my surprise . I then bought the Chicken Zuke 's , which they rejected . So It 's back to the beef recipe . Since all my dogs are older , I figured that the extra benifit of 'hip action ' would be a good thing	1
My dog is picky about treats and she loves this product . It 's also low on calories . As the headline says , this really works .	1
We have tried a few of the Zuke 's treats and so far my dog has liked all of them . Will buy again .	1
I was very happy to try this product having a few medical ailments and also being a walking accident that has resulted in some bad falls.I have rheumatism that flares up several times a month . I usually take an ibuprofen when the pain is too intense or try to sleep it off . I also have two herniated discs in my back along with a recovering injured ankle both due to falls . I was hoping this medicine would take some of the pain away but it did more that that.One thing I did notice is when I first started taking it I did get an upset stomach but it was not much of an issue . I would drink Ginger Ale or eat saltines to help with the stomach issues . After being on Zyflamend for a few weeks I have noticed I am not grabbing the ibuprofen as much if at all . I am surprised that the ` pain ' my body was feeling is not as severe . It is be no means gone but not to the point when I feel I can not function.I think you need to stay on this medicine if it works for you . I am going to be buying some more for the future . I am glad I found something that works on several of my problems . Instead of treating them all separately I am able to treat them once and that in itself is a savings .	1
New Chapter has yet to disappoint me with their vitamins . These particular softgels removed my father 's inflammation in a matter of a week ( without any other pills or vitamins ) . Quite impressive !	1
I have severe osteoarthritis in my knee with bone loss . Even taking the prescription pain medication I still experienced pain at times severe . I did n't want to increase the Rx level . This product was recommended to me by a colleague . I found that it truly helps . Most days I can get through with none or very little pain unless I overdo it . I 've been using this for over two years now and swear by it .	1
Original review : Research shows that products like this can take months to show results that can be felt or measured , and possibly years of use to judge effectiveness in other areas , so for the purpose of this review , I will stick to tangible factors:1 . No stomach discomfort at all , nor have I had a taste or smell of the product in the minutes after I take it . I do only take one soft gel per day in the morning , breakfast or not.2 . I love the fact that the soft gels are dark , and the bottle is dark , so I know that the ingredients are protected from light as much as possible.3 . I do n't find the softgels hard to take at all , but I 've been taking fish oil for years and years , and I am used to really big softgels . I do not like to take large powdery tablets , so I think it is the gel part that makes it easy.4 . I am tickled to find a product that contains turmeric , which has been clinically proven around the world to have significant benefits . I have taken tumeric for several years now , so finding this product is exciting , and helps me cut down on supplements.Bottom line : I took tumeric and fish oil for years . I plan to reorder this in the coming months , and will post updates . ***November 2009 : I did come back and order a second bottle of this . I noticed that I could squat down to the floor for something and pop back up like normal , so it must be doing something for my knees ... everything in it is good for you so ... ***December 2010 : I have this product on Autoship and I 'm sharing it with the husband . I think this helps so much with just the general joint issues that come with time . I imagine I 'll continue taking it for the foreseeable future .	1
I first heard about Xyflamend over the 4th of July week , at a bed and breakfast . A fellow guest mentioned that when he started taking Xyflamend , he had prostate cancer , and now his PSA is 0.00 . That alone makes it worthwhile.My cuts and scrapes easily get infected , and I had some when I started taking Xyflamend . In a few days , the infections were gone.Even though I 'm 58 , and am physically active , I have very few aches and pains , so I ca n't say if Xyflamend has helped much there . However , I have ringing in my ears.I 've taken a couple of capulets of Ring Relief a day for about the last 4 years . Its helped me a lot , but just a few weeks of Xyflamend , and the ringing is almost gone , and I 'm hearing low level sounds I had a hard time hearing before Xyflamend . I have n't had an audio test so I ca n't tell you if there was a measurable improvement , but just having my ears quiet down is worth it.I started out taking one with breakfast , and another with dinner , but breakfast was too light to avoid bowel discomfort ( I have a cast iron stomach for most foods ) , so I cut back to just one with dinner . I seem to still have the same results with one as I did with two , so I think I 'll just stay with one a day .	1
I use this as an anti inflammatory . I have been taking it for years . Based on some studies from the Cleveland Clinic etc , I take it for its anti cancer properties .	1
I initially bought this item to help with the minor pain I get daily from inflammation . However , I find it works ok for the inflammation , not as good as I had hoped , but by surprise it certainly helps with my night sweats and hot flashes . They have decreased immensely and I do n't feel so uncomfortable when I 'm shopping and break out into a great sweat . Not sure which item in this does the trick , but I 'm one happy camper . I sleep better too ! Give it a try , it 's not a bad price either .	1
I have osteoarthritis and have trouble with inflammation in my joints . This product combines many of the recommended anti-inflammatory substances into one easy to take capsule . My system tolerates it well and it seems to minimize the need to use NSAIDs . I obviously have n't conducted a double blind test involving many people , but I feel better and I think it is in part due to this product .	1
I was starting to get joint pain in my knee 's and ankles after running . I like to run anywhere from 2 to 3 miles during the week and longer 6 to 10 miles on the weekend . After those runs , small aches and pains in the joints started making themselves noticed.After a week of taking this product , I no longer have that pain . It would appear to be working just fine for now .	1
Do n't know why this works for me , but it does . My stomach does n't tolerate NSAIDS , but I was doubtful this would work . Did n't work for my mom , but it really eases the arthritis pain in my hands .	1
I 'm a landscaper , and after years of hard work , my hip and knees have become a daily problem . Add to that the fact that I just restarted a strenuous workout program and you have a recipe for stiff joints . I have been taking glucosamine , msm , and chondroitin for many years and have found it helped enormously , but there 's a limit to how much they grease the joints . Usually after about a 45 minute walk , or a workout in which I jump up and down or do any kind of vigorous side to side motion , I 'd be experiencing strong knee pain for a few days afterward.I 've been taking this Zyflamend for about three weeks now and I have been surprised that my new workout routine 's only made my joints sore once ! I even had a week in there where I forgot about my hip pain , which is really saying something as it 's usually a constant.Now , I have to say in all honesty that I also had some Feldenkrais treatments around the same time I started this Zyflamend supplement , so it 's hard to say for sure that all the improvement is Zyflamend , but I think at least part of the improvement is due to it , because I am absolutely shocked to not have my knees hurting after all the side to side jumping around I 've been doing lately to lose weight.I 'm going to take this stuff through the winter when my joints are usually worst , and skip it during summer , mostly likely . I think it is helping but is probably only necessary in addition to my other supplements when I am having a flareup of some kind.But if you 're in pain or anticipating irritating your joints , this is a heck of a lot cheaper and less invasive than a cortizone shot , so I 'd say it 's worth a try.I always take my supplements in the middle of a meal , and with other reviewers saying they 're getting tummy problems from it , I 'd recommend doing the same if you take it . Just eat half your food , have your pills , then finish eating . Good practice for taking supplements anyway .	1
My joint pain seems to be decreasing , but this is no overnight miracle drug . I am going to continue to take this item and see if my pain decreases more . I will update this as I see fit .	1
I got these through Amazon vine and am very pleased I chose them . After being on them for a month , I can really notice a difference in the way I feel . It 's definitely hard to pinpoint when taking a supplement like this , but my joints feel less achey , and I just plain feel better . No upset stomach like some pills and everything I have ever taken from this particular manufacturer has been stellar . Try them .	1
For several years now , anytime we would have otherwise felt the need for an ibuprofen , Tylenol or other pain medicine , we generally take Zyflamend instead due to the anti-inflammatory properties . We have used Zyflamend for joint pain such as when my husband broke his hip and later when his back sustained a compression fracture as well as for heart health - docs gave him 2 weeks or less to live due to Acute on Chronic Severe Congestive Heart Failure , Stage 3 and 4 yet we are on Year 4 and counting ; - ) , and we do not doubt taking these over pharmaceuticals and OTC NSAIDs these past few years also somehow played at the very least a minor role in his cure of Type 2 diabetes ( 18 year battle , no more ! ! : :happy dance : : : ) . The herbs in Zyflamend are whole-food sourced instead of chemically altering the herbs trying to seek out one or two individual substances ( think pharmaceuticals ... ) . Zyflamend is geared towards halting an over-active inflammation process . As the packaging states , undoubtedly Zyflamend can help with `` normal tissue growth , breast health , natural inflammation response , skin health , joint health , lung health , heart health , pancreas health , prostate health , and bone health . '' We have found taking one softgel with two meals on the days it is needed has given us the best results , though they can be taken on an empty stomach ( ginger undoubtedly helps in this regard . ) Per the package : Serving size 2 softgels Servings per container 90 ( 180 softgel size ) Rosemary 150 mgTurmeric 110 mg ( great anti-inflammatory properties ) Ginger 100 mg ( calms stomach among other properties ) Holy Basil 100 mg ( Tulsi - Google it.. ) Organic Green Tea 100 mgHu Zhang 80 mg ( Polygonum cuspidatum ) Chinese Goldthread 40 mgBarberry 40 mgOrganic Oregano 40 mgChinese Skullcap 20 mgOther ingredients : Extra virgin olive oil ( EVOO ) , maltodextrin , silica , yellow beeswax , and organic sunflower oil . ( A friend with fibromyalgia can not take maltodextrin ... make sure to read up on the ingredients in ALL supplements ) Capsule : Gelatin ( Halal ) , vegetable glycerin , water and carob.New Chapter states the softgel supplements are prepared without chemical solvents and are BSE free . The package also indicates these supplements are NON-GMO Verified and are naturally gluten free.UPDATE : The other day I made an unintended attempt at flight ... from a step stool ... and failed miserably . Crashed and BURNED . Well.. crashed.. and burned on the corner of the counter where I now sport a serious large bruise . One of my docs said somehow I `` rotated '' which means it is n't just a concussion nor is it just whiplash , it 's more.. much more ... rotation ... all I know is it really hurts much worse than `` just whiplash '' and the sharp recurrent stabs upon movement are much worse than shredding an ACL . I am VERY appreciative of the bottle of Zyflamend that I just happened to order a few weeks ago . Very appreciative . I have no idea how I would get through this without . Thanks New Chapter ! Oh and THANKS AMAZON , the bottle arrived a few weeks ago , but alas I had faith it would arrive without fail , to be here and available when critically needed.. I simply did n't realize just how soon that critical need was going to arise.. er.. fall.. you know what I mean .	1
This is a high quality supplement that reduces inflammation and protects your health . I take it every day and I feel great .	1
Note : this review is written for the 60 softgel bottle of the same product.I tried this product because I was looking for something for joint pain . I have tightness in legs from the knees through the ankles . They stiffen and do n't bend like they used to.After trying this product for about 3 days , I saw a noticeable difference . I take the recommended dose of two softgel tabs a day . At 60 softgels , that is a 1 month supply.The label says : It is formulated for whole body healthy inflammation response and promotes natural cardiovascular and joint function and that it is the # 1 selling herbal in the U.S. `` Zyflamend has been shown in preclinical studies to promote a healthy inflammation response that can benefit the whole body , including : the health of the joints , heart , lungs , immune system , breasts , prostate , and skin . '' BSE and gluten free.Two softgels contain : Note : I looked up these ingredients in another book and some on WebMD.com . A small piece of that info is below in parenthesis ) Rosemary 150mg ( fights inflammation and circulatory problems ) Tumeric110mg ( aids circulation , improves blood vessel health , has antibiotic , anti-cancer , and anti inflammatory properties ) Ginger100mg ( fights inflammation , reduces spasms and cramps , stimulates circulation . Good for circulatory problems and arthritis ) Holy Basil 100mg ( may slow blood clotting , may decrease blood sugar in folks with type 2 diabetes , may help with colds and flu ) .Organic Green Tea 100mg ( antioxidant and helps protect against cancer . Helps regulate blood sugar ) Hu Zhang 80mg ( Used for conditions involving the heart , blood vessels , and digestive -- may not be good for hormone sensitive conditions ) Chinese Goldthread 40mgBarberry 40mg ( decreases heart rate , slows breathing , reduces bronchial constriction , kills bacteria on the skin , stimulates intestinal movement ) Organic Oregano 40mgChinese Skullcap 20mg ( improves circulation , strengthens heart muscle , relieves muscle cramps ) Just as a caution , there are often other things to consider , for example `` do n't take a certain herb if you are pregnant or use a blood thinner , or whatever . '' You should always read up on supplements and talk to your health care provider to check supplements before taking them . I am not a doctor , but if you are on a blood thinner , you most definitely want to check with your doctor before purchasing this product.Note : After taking this product for about 6 weeks , I think the oregano irritated my digestion , so I am backing off for a couple of weeks . I still believe this is a great product and really helped me , so I am going to ( how do you say it ? ) step back and punt . I was taking two at a time before , sometimes with meals and sometimes without , sometimes earlier in the day and sometimes later at night . When I start these again , I will : -- take ONE with each of two meals , and try to sandwich the pill within the meal , so my stomach is not empty . ( take the pill in the middle of the meal ) -- drink plenty of water with the pill -- take the second pill no later than 5 pm ( or skip it )	1
but a bit cheaper . Exactly the same supplement that we previously purchased from the doctor but cheaper than he charges .	1
I started taking it to help with an inflamed foot problem . It has n't hurt any but I ca n't say it 's helped much either . It 's only been a couple weeks so I 'll use up the bottle .	1
The ingredients are pure , and a great synergy of the top herbal treatments . They 're a bit smaller than most liquid pills . You can smell and taste them , but I enjoy that since they 're partly robust culinary herbs ( however , I also enjoy traditional chinese medicinal herbs most of the time ) . I ca n't directly attribute positive results to them with total certainty . But I do feel better . I have n't caught the widespread colds , even at home . And my back pain has relaxed significantly ( although I 've also been doing physical therapy , so I ca n't say which is having more of the positive effects ) . Given how clear it is now that systemic inflammation is largely responsible for so many common ailments , I believe what the company says that this should be deemed as requisite as daily multi 's .	1
Excellent product.It also contains a lot of healthy ingredients and antivirals that should also help you fight the fluas well as cancer and other diseases . Just be sure to start out slowly by taking one capsulea day for the first week or so because some of the herbs can be a little harsh for people withsensitive stomachs .	1
Since I have only used one bottle and it takes 2-3 bottles to achieve full effectiveness , I can only rate it 4 stars . Overall , I feel that it works as it says it does . I have noticed I take a lot less ibuprofen for joint pain . In fact , in the last two week , I have n't taken any . I have a chronic shoulder injury that I just re-injured at work this past Friday . I did n't need to take anything for the pain . I just took the Zyflamend as directed and a hot bath . The shoulder feels okay , I can tell it is healing . I will definitely be purchasing another bottle . I have shopped around for pricing and it is sold elsewhere online for almost half price . Be sure to do your homework before purchasing for the best deal .	1
I tried this product after reading about it on alternative healing websites . I have systemic lupus erythematosus with lots of inflammation issues . While zyflamend did not alter my inflammation markers or end my joint pain , I am continuing to take it and giving the product five stars . Here 's why : Nothing I 've taken has been able to improve my inflammation markers beyond where they are . With meds , my particular manifestation of this disease is stable and quiet but unremitting . So , unless something else comes along , this is going to be as good as it gets , and the fact that it did n't get better is not the fault of this supplement.Several friends of mine who have other inflammatory conditions , such as osteoarthritis , rheumatoid arthritis , and IBS , have had really excellent results with Zyflamend , which , in theory , works on the same inhibitors as the prescription NSAIDs but has heart protective components as well . One friend was able to stop taking a prescription product that had , at one point , been taken off the market . The other did n't have any relief from her pain , but saw her IBS symptoms subside considerably . And a male friend felt that it helped his joint pain quite a bit and also seemed to help with frequency issues he 'd developed with age.Everyone 's different . In my case , my prescriptions seem to be what keeps SLE in check . But the SLE has caused cardiovascular issues in the past , and this supplement has a good dose of herbs that promote cardiovascular health . So , I 'm going to keep taking it.Talk to your doctor , and give this a try . If it works for you , you will be so much better off than with the prescriptions and their side effects . If it does n't work , at worst , you 'll be better-nourished than you were before you tried it.UPDATE : I wrote this review three days into my second bottle of Zyflamend . While my SLE disease markers are unchanged , a pain issue I had from a car accident a few years ago has improved tremendously . I can turn my head and look over my shoulder for the first time in a couple of years . Yay ! Neither my rheumatologist nor my physical therapist had been able to make a dent in that issue , which was just some kind of arthritis-like pain in my neck and right shoulder , but the pain is nearly gone .	1
I notice a definite difference in my whole body when I do n't take them . All I can say is give them a try because they do work for me .	1
I take these daily for help with my aches and pains . I was not sure they were really helping much until I stopped taking them for a couple weeks cause I ran out . I can say that taking the Zyflamend does make a difference it how I feel overall .	1
This worked great on the pain caused by cervical disk degeneration , from the very first dose . Unfortunately , it also gave me horrible and fiery diarrhea.However , package insert warned of this possible side affect and gave instructions for avoiding or reducing it ( which I 'll detail -- because it seems to be working for me ) . Following the directions , I switched to the Zyflamend EasyCaps ( which contain a much smaller dose and are therefore easier on my stomach ) . After switching , I started out with 1 EasyCap a day for a few days ( the amount of time it took my tummy to get used to it ) . Then I increased to 1 EasyCap , twice a day , and then next day , I switched to 3 EasyCaps ( 1 capsule , 3 times a day ) . My stomach is almost used to that dose , and when it is , I 'll gradually switch to the recommended dose of 2 EasyCaps , 3 times a day . When my stomach is used to that dose , I 'll switch completely back to the regular Zyflamend.I expect the gradual dose increase will probably take a 2-4 weeks , and when I 've completed the switch back to the regular-strength Zyflamend , I 'll report back on its efficacy and affects on my stomach . If it works ( meaning my stomach will tolerate the full dose , and it will keep working on my neck pain ) -- and I fully expect it to ( because my stomach is already getting used to the smaller dose ) -- it will have been worth the effort .	1
I have psoriasis and have had high CRP for several years . This past year the CRP jumped from 3 to 10 . I started taking Zyflamend and also upped my steroid use on the psoriasis . I 1 month the CRP went from 10 to 4 . Not sure if it was the zyflamend or the steroids , but I 'm hopeful that the zyflamend had something to do with it . Have n't noticed any change in my joint pain yet .	1
After being told 6 years ago that I needed surgery on both knees I have not been able to do as many things that I used to do . I opted not to have surgery and have to be careful in my activities.I have tried many different medications that were all prescribed by my doctor to help ease with the pain as well as knee braces to wear as I needed them . My doctor kept insisting on surgery and the last time that I threw my knee out I was almost ready to give in and have the operations but I thought that I would try something herbal first , on a friends advice.I researched many herbal pharmacopoeia items and purchased a couple of different brands . After experimenting with the `` herbal medication '' I found that New Chapter Zyflamend worked well for me . I have been taking 3 a day for a month and can tell a positive difference with my knees . I am able to move easier without the fear of throwing a knee out.I must admit that these did not work for me overnight like other reviewers has mentioned , but I could tell a difference after the first week.After a regular check up with my doctor he asked about my knees and I told him about New Chapter Zyflamend . He laughed and called it Snake Oil . I told him the `` Snake Oil '' works for me and I will continue to use it , as well as recommend it to others . It does work !	1
i was having a lot of trouble with my hip this summer and my chiro suggested i try this in addition to taking it a little more easy in the gym . i was happy to try it since i was popping ibuprofen like pez . it was n't immediate , but , the pain has pretty much subsided . i 'm finally running again and the only pain i feel are in the muscles that are still tight around the side of my hip . i am making sure to gently stretch and foam roll to reduce tension and soreness .	1
It helps my arthritis . Recommendation from my orthopedist . As a diabetic in stage 3 kidney failure I can not take pharmaceutical pain pills including ibuprofen . This does not damage kidneys or liver .	1
I 've been using more and more of the New Chapter products because I 've found them to be high-quality and effective . This one is no exception . The only downside is that you really , really have to make sure you eat first before taking this . A lot of supplements say to take them with a meal , but mostly you can get by without taking them with a meal ( at least I can ) . However , if you take Zyflamend without eating -- and I recommend eating first , not just popping your pill at the same time you eat -- you will likely end up with a burning upset stomach . It 's an effective product , though . So as long as you remember to eat first , I 'd say try it and see how it works for you .	1
My mom suffers some age-related joint pain , and I had her try this herbal remedy . It seemed to help , and just as significantly did n't seem to cause any side-effects or gastro issues for her ( she 's normally very sensitive to many medications ) .With this sort of remedy , it 's hard to separate actual effects from the placebo effect , or from combinations of other hard-to-quantify variable such as the weather , activity levels , diet , etc , but it seems like it may help , and it does n't hurt .	1
I went to their website ( [ ... ] / ) to learn more about their products and was quite impressed . This Zyflamend softgel is a regular anti-inflammatory powerhouse with amazing ingredients as listed accurately on Amazon 's product description . Since it has a somewhat spicy taste to it , I make sure I take it during or after a meal and have not experienced any GI upset . Oddly since I 've been taking this ( and their iron support and rhodiola force 300 ) , I have not had any reflux symptoms . This is a miracle in itself , as usually I experience reflux after my AM coffee ( and yes , I 'm aware folks w/ reflux should avoid caffeine and other well known irritating foods ) . Based on this company 's philosophy and manufacturing techniques , I think this is one of the most reputable companies in the supplement market . For that reason , I already ordered a second larger bottle of this product as I think it provides the best value for its contents and price . If you are serious about decreasing systemic inflammation get your personal MD to order a CRP blood test for a baseline and then try this product for a month or 2 and then repeat the CRP to determine if this product is working well for your body . I also think based on my personal experience for my hip and bilateral knees , if you have arthritis and were to take this product in conjunction w/ a product such as Source Naturals ' hyaluronic joint complex , you would notice a remarkable decrease in joint discomfort and increase in function .	1
I 've had great results from taking New Chapter Zyflamend . My blood pressure is back to normal and it 's really helped with pain from inflammation in my spine and neck due to years of arthritis . My husband uses the Zyflamend Night Time ... 2 gel caps about an hour before he goes to bed . After having trouble sleeping for several years he 's sleeping very well without waking up several times a night to go to the bathroom . I had a wee bit of heartburn the first few days I took it but my stomach got used to the herbs very quickly . I have a sensitive stomach and I 'm having no problems taking this at all now . I do take it with food . I highly recommend this product .	1
these are very good for me and very expensive in my local store . regular delivery helps make sure I do n't run out	1
I took these for 30 days , and really did n't see any noticeable difference in how my joints felt , before or after taking these . I take a lot of supplements already , that could be why Zyflamend did n't make a noticeable difference . Would probably be more useful to someone not taking anything else .	1
I take this when my joints are swollen - it really helps . Also has reversatrol - great for your heart !	1
Last weekend , while perusing a product page for something else , I became fascinated by a very helpful and well written and videotaped review there ... so much so that I clicked on the reviewer 's `` see my other reviews '' link to see what else she might be recommending and in short order came across this product , which really grabbed my attention , as I 'm a firm believer that inflammation is the root of so much of what ails us . Amazon Prime delivered it the next day . Three days into this regimen , I 'm already starting to feel better . I 'm particularly glad though that I followed the advice on the package , which says this 2-a-day product should be introduced into your system by starting with just one a day and and taken while eating your day 's biggest meal . As a result , I had just a bit of stomach crampiness the first day , but since then no problems.Update 11/20 : No cramping came with the transition to the recommended two a day . And I do think this stuff may be helping . It 's hard to tell just how much amid all the damp weather and being at the peak of leaf-mold allergy season , but I 'm definitely feeling a lot less awful than I usually do at this time of the year and I 'm sleeping better than I had been . Will be interesting to see if there 's more significant uptick once the leaves have been carted away and the leaf-blowers are silenced.I see that there 's a PM version of this product available and will probably give that a try soon .	1
I started on this product in 2005 after knee surgery.It has been an excellent supportive product and I will continue to use it .	1
Love . Love . Love . Love . I ca n't say enough about this product . It helped clear up my sinus problems , it decreased my stomach bloating , it decreases my allergies , my joints are n't as achey , and now I 'm in love . I can tell when I do n't take it . It really has made a big difference in my overall feelings of health.I passed this on to my mom who also is feeling the benefits . She suffers from arthritis and has felt some relief , especially in her fingers . She also has frequent headaches , which have almost completely stopped . She also has felt a decrease in her stomach bloat and allergies.These pills are large . If you do n't like large pills , you can opt for the tiny caps which are 3 very small pills instead of 1 large pill . It 's slightly more expensive , but completely worth it if you have a problem with pills.It 's definitely a great product . If you are thinking about it , you should buy it and give it a shot !	1
I have been taking Zyflamend about 6 weeks and it seems to be helping . I take one of the Whole Body in the morning with breakfast and one of the Nighttime in the evening.The swelling and inflammation in my legs appears to have decreased considerably , especially my three-times damaged right foot/right knee/right lower leg . The inflammation has not disappeared completely , but I am hopeful that it will continue to decrease with continued use . It is noticeable that the `` hot spots '' around the knees and down the legs have decreased in duration and size . The swelling in my right lower leg has subsided so that it seems closer in size to my left leg for the first time in several months . It does get puffy in spots , especially just below the knee , but no longer remains puffy for extended periods of time.I am still in occasional , intermittent pain , but since I have a `` damaged '' areas , etc. , I can not expect miracles.The Nighttime has seemed to help with my sleeping a little more soundly . The inflammation / pain would occasionally wake me when I shifted positions and make it difficult to return to a sound sleep.In general , I think these products have work to reduce inflammation in my complete system . My overall circulation appears to be better . The stiffness that I get in my back from sitting at a PC all day seems to be much less.Now for the bad news , this product has produced intermittent heart-burn and occasional acid reflux . I am prone to stomach upset / IBS , but I was hoping the ginger in the product would decrease / prevent over acid production . I have ordered some of the GingerForce to add to my regime in the hope that will help.I would recommend that anyone , that has inflammation that needs reducing , should at least try this product . I bought the 30 softgels bottle first and have since switched to the 60 softgels size on subscribe and save .	1
I was trending toward having arthritis pain and stiffness when a naturopath started me on Zyflamend . I 've been taking since mid-June , 2010 , and have no pain . If I miss taking it for a few days , I can tell it . I have it on subscription so I never run out .	1
My picky Italian Greyhound goes crazy for these ! Definitely his favorite snack of many . There are four distinct flavors and the dog even gets more excited for some over others . Firm/dense but not rock hard . Enough to give a decent teeth cleaning but little dogs can still break them apart . They crumble when chewed but not particularly messy like some dry snacks . I was really disappointed to not find them locally anymore but at least we can get them online .	1
Both my dogs really love this treat . The small to medium size is good for both of my 8 pound and 20 pound dogs . My 8 pound chihuahua mix has no trouble breaking it down into smaller pieces . It took them less than 5 minutes to learn the word `` Scooby '' . So now when I say Scooby , they get really excited cause know they 're getting one of these .	1
These are very hard to find in stores although I have recently seen them in Target . My dog loves them all since they have different flavors . Much better for him than the bland milk bones . I gave it 5 stars because my dog never snubs them like other treats I have given him . I would give it a try !	1
These are perfect for stuffing toys , like kongs and other types with smaller holes.I put round and square ones into my Aussie 's large regularly shaped kong , and the biscuit-looking ones into my rat terrier 's stuffable chew toys . She does n't get the regularly shaped kong , because her jaw is smaller than the kong 's opening , so she fishes the cookies out very easily . She gets other toys ( from Petsmart ) which are very tough as well , but have smaller openings , like KONG Stuff-A-Ball . It takes her over 20 minutes to get them out . These cookies are much harder than regular biscuits . It takes her 5 minutes to get the regular biscuits and snaps out of any toy.my rat terrier is a very powerful chewer ...	1
My dog absolutely loves this food and it is so much easier to have it delivered than to lug it home from the grocery store . Especially when you have the cat food too . Sometimes it 's worth a little extra to have it brought to you .	1
Happy with this purchase , product as stated in description . Now we 'll just see how well the rolley polley pup named Goosey ( for silly goose ) , eats it up . He seems to not mind it when there is n't any canned stuff offered .	1
I have a miniature dachshund that is addicted to table food . Normaly I leave dry food available at all times and 1 bowl of wet food a day . He has always been a picky eater , basically just wanted human food . Recently he would take a bite or 2 of his dry food and barely touch his wet . So we decided to switch dog food , and ended up choosing this . He LOVES this stuff , I ca n't leave dry down anymore because he gobbles it up before it hits bowl ! Also we buy the containers on Beneful wet food , he loves that as well ! Another thing that I love about this food is it makes his coat shiny and soft . Not sure how but ever since he started eating this he has had softer and shinier coat .	1
My dogs just love this brand of food . I highly recommend it , and i will buy this product again . GREAT ! ! !	1
So ... I have a Pomerania and let me tell you ... he is very picky about his food ! I have tried a few different types of small bite type dog foods and this one is the only one he really likes . The bites are small enough for his small teeth and jaws and he jumps for joy every time i break out his food like he is getting a treat . Shhh.. do n't say treat to loud ! : P	1
My dog just loves Beneful . He 's a picky eater but loves all the varieties that Beneful has to offer . This brand has the right mix of hard and soft morsels which I feel is the reason he likes it so much .	1
This dog food is well liked by my pets . The healthy weight formula gives them more pep and energy since both have lost a few pounds . I will buy it again . I just wish the 31.1 lb bag came with a resealable zipper closure .	1
My puppy loves this . It was a great price delivered to my door . It came boxed and was in good shape .	1
This is my dogs favorite food ! The price was less than at the store , how could I say no ? A real deal !	1
Of the various Beneful flavors , this is the one that wins the doggies vote . It even beat the Iam 's and Nutro Max weight management foods out . It seems to have a lot of corn , corm meal , flour and whole whet . It only has chicken by product meal . Buy hey - the kids like it that 's what matters	1
I ordered this online through Amazon as it 's so much easier to have them deliver to my doorstep . I live remotely , so to spend the money in gas is n't hardly worth it when Amazon 's Prime gets it here in two days . Unfortunately , we had unfavorable weather when it was delivered -- rain , though a rare commodity in the desert , would have easily soaked the bag and box this dog food arrives in . Apparently the UPS driver opted to leave the item at a neighbor 's home as I have a gated driveway and numerous dogs running loose . Well , the dog food never made it to me , so I called Amazon . They immediately reordered the food free of charge and it was mailed overnight . Wow ! I was so impressed . About a week later an embarrassed neighbor confessed , they told me they thought it was their purchase as they also feed their dog the same food and buy online . When they did n't find the charge on their bank account they rethought the situation . By then their dog was eating my dog food . Well , gee , accidents happen , right ? The point is , Amazon fixed the problem immediately and two individuals were very pleased with the results . Thanks Amazon for being so darn helpful , understanding , and providing the best customer service possible !	1
My very picky 2 one year olds ( 22 lb and 63 lb Walrus breed ) plus my 7 year old Shih Tzu love this stuff ! I was making homemade food and they prefer this now . Great food and good brand . I highly recommend this food .	1
This was a better price than at the big box store , and it came straight to my door . That 's a double bonus ! I really appreciate the easy-to-open tops on these ; start in the middle , and peel the tape off - easy as can be . My pooch loves , loves , loves beneful dog food . I think it 's because there are moist bits as well as crunch bits , but whatever the reason , she literally foams at the mouth when she eats it . The flavor I purchased was Playful Life , but there are quite a few different kinds and sizes . My dog also likes the Fiesta and the Original .	1
I sent this as a donation to a lady with lots of rescues , and while I do n't feed my dog this brand , her dogs LOVED it ! Ca n't beat Amazon 's price for this food ! Even Petco and PetsMart were much more expensive ! !	1
I was grateful to be able to find this large size of the dog food I feed my Corgis . Thank you for carrying it . I like the food because my dogs seem to feel more energetic on it and Purina is one of the brands my veterinarian recommends .	1
Dog loves them.She seems to be more energetic when she has them . Thinks they 're a treat .	1
I have 7 dogs ( 3 chihuahuas , 2 pitbulls , 1 miniature pinscher and an akita mix ) . They all love the taste of this easy to administer supplement ! For the chihuahua with no teeth , I take a small scissor and shave the wafer into a powder and mix it in with his wet food and it gets eaten happily .	1
I wo n't give this a bad review because my dog is small , but we bought this huge bucket and he really does n't seem to like these . I do n't know if its the taste or the texture ; they seem quite hard and he is getting up there in age . Anyhow , its a struggle to get him to eat these so we will likely give the bucket to our neighbor and their 75lb pit bull ; I imagine a larger , younger dog will gobble these up !	1
These supplements seem to have the best balance of nutrients . My puppy thinks they are treats , and chews up his daily half tab without complaint .	1
These were a really good deal over what my vet charges . These are what my vet recommends as the best dog vitamin to supplement a homemade diet which my dog needs . I also give a piece of one to my chihuahua daily along with his food .	1
Bought this for my dogs for a suppliment once a day and they love it . Could'nt be more pleased . Wish I had found this product years ago .	1
I have been giving these vitamins to my 6 dogs for one year . The dogs love the taste , the price is better than I 've seen anywhere else and the vitamins are a very well-formulated combination for all dogs . These helped my dogs tremendously , especially my older dogs . Their skin and hair is glossy and much nicer than before they were taking the Canine-Plus vitamins.I recommend these vitamins to all dog owners .	1
My Dobermans get this as a treat as well as a dietary supplement . Has all the important vitamins and minerals to provide optimum health .	1
Have been using this vitamin for several months after I thought I would cook for my dogs ... now they are eating a canned diet , but I still use this supplement . Both dogs , ages 4 and 13 years have wonderful coats and their Vets think they look in excellent shape and wonder what I am feeding them ! I think the only logical change is this vitamin . And they respond : Vetri Science makes good products , these dogs look great !	1
I give my dogs one of these a day solely as a treat . They love them . I know they are safe ... instead of the treats from China that have sickened a lot of dogs . The large size is economical and last a long time . Will continue to use this for my dogs .	1
These are a good reliable canine vitamin . I really care about my dogs health . I do not feed my dogs commercial pet food . I cook for my dogs . The do eat comm dog treats but only the ones I buy at my organic natural dog food store . I 'm super particular about my dogs diet and I think Vetri Science has a dependable brand	1
I 've been letting the expensive food I feed my dog cover his needs . I just started using these two months ago and wow , what a change in my dog . Everything about him has improved . I 'm no scientist but I know what works . Do your dog a favor and buy Canine Plus . You 'll be happy you did !	1
I 'd previously tried the Vetri-science probiotic treats for my puppy , which he devoured ! These canine supplements are fine - they do the job , but puppy is not too fussed about these large tablets ( although he is quite a picky customer ) . Usually , I break it up in his food , and to their credit - he 'll eventually eat it . I wish they came in a smaller , more puppy friendly form though .	1
Dogs like 'em . Have to break them up for the littlest one ( easy enough ) , But otherwise , no problems . As I recall , price went up recently , so I held off re-buying .	1
I have been giving these Vetri-Science Laboratories Canine Plus Beef Chewable Tablets multivitamin and mineral supplements to my dogs for years .

I have tried many many other brands and this is by far the best food . With a lot of coat issues , my Chihuahuas are very sensitive . This food is such high quality that their waste is so minimal . Other brands made them & # 34 ; go & # 34 ; frequently to the point they had a hard time holding it . Not with this food . This is the only brand I will ever buy them .	1
I adopted Sam from a local shelter . He had a dull , brittle coat , constant rash and other health issues . I had him allergy tested and found he was allergic to some 40 foods and environmental allergens . The allergy testing places compiled a list of dog foods he could eat . All were expensive ( $ 60+ for a 30lb bag ) and hard to find where I live in rural Alaska . But we love our dogs up here and I found that I could get Avoderm on Amazon for a hair over $ 40 for a 30lb bag with free shipping . I have n't made my postman happy , but my dog loves it and I love the price and ease . Sam ca n't have potatoes , peas , and a lot of grains , so Avoderm has really changed his life and mine . Thanks Amazon !	1
I feel fortunate to have looked on Amazon for our regular dog food , and have been getting it here ever since . You ca n't beat the home delivery AND saving at least $ 10 with every bag ( I have Prime so I do n't have the added shipping cost ) . My dogs are a rat terrier and a JR terrier . Ages 8 and 12 respectively . They have been eating this food for years and are in perfect health . I do give them human food too ... ..turkey , pasta , meat loaf , carrots , apples ... .mac n cheese ... they get a small portion of whatever we are eating about once a day , but their main diet is this AvoDerm .	1
We 've been feeding Avoderm for about 8 months and our Aussie is doing beautifully . Lots of energy , shiny coat . The formula is absolutely as good as Blue , and some of the other more expensive brands . I would highly recommend it . Fast delivery , too !	1
My puppy had Avoderm since she was little . When she grew up , I tried switching to other brand but i noticed her fur is getting dull . And she 's shiny & soft again when i switch back to Avoderm . I 'm pretty happy with Avoderm so far.. we have to mix it with other brand half/half to reduce the cost . But she 's still soft and shiny enough : )	1
I have tried many , many brands ( including Canidae , Merrick , Natural Balance , and Nutro ) and this is by far the best .	1
Great dog food , much cheaper than in the stores ( usually ) . One thing though , make sure you select either 30 pounds for 42 or so dollars , or 4.4 pounds for 16 or so dollars . If it does n't say the weight , do n't assume it 's the larger bag because of the price . Other websites have this problem as well .	1
I thank God for Avoderm . We have a chocolate lab who as a pup had all kinds of digestive issues and would throw up or have diarrhea with various dog foods , and let me tell you , we tried everything . Finally I came across Avoderm and a ton of testimonials about how great it was for dogs with digestive problems and picky eaters . Harley loved it ! And it immediately eliminated the diarrhea . The problem was he wolfed the food down -- he liked it that much . So we purchased a specialty dish to slow down his consumption . One note to those with dogs who 'itch ' or have dry skin . We actually attempted to try Blue Wilderness with Harley and his itching was out of control . Once we put him on Avoderm the results were instantaneous and he has never itched since . His coat literally glows on this kibble ! And he 's very 'happy ' compared to a more lethargic , droopy attitude on the Blue Wilderness . I 'm sure Blue is a good kibble , but for Harley he absolutely loves his Avoderm and looks and feels better because of it . I most definitely would recommend this product to others !	1
This is top quality food and the only pellets I 'll feed my Quaker parrot . He makes a mess dipping it in his water bowl to eat it , but he loves it . And I love knowing I 'm giving him something good for him .	1
This is the staple of my cockatiel 's diet . I 've tried many other pellets , including other Zupreem flavors , but when it comes down to it , they always prefer this size , this flavor , they go to it every time . Recommend .	1
I used to feed my cockatiels colored pellets but changed to these at the recommendation of my avian vet because of the dyes . I 've been feeding this to my cockatiels for over 7 years along with occasional fresh foods and seeds . Getting them to eat the healthy fresh foods can be difficult so I feel better that pellets are supplementing some of the nutrition they need . I never could get my oldest cockatiel ( 29yr ) to take to any pellets as he had eaten an all seed diet his whole life .	1
My cockatiel has been on this food for the past 6 years , and loves it ! The vet is always amazed at how good she looks ( she also gets a seed mixture and sprouted seeds as well ) . My second cockatiel took awhile to convert , but now she too eats the zupreem natural . I like this stuff way more than I like the colored pellets , which smell funny and change the color of their poop .	1
some of the best quality food you can buy for your birds . I prefer the naturals version over the colored ones to prevent the bird from getting color picky and only eating certain colors . great for making cage cleanup much easier instead of seed hulls littered everywhere .	1
My cockatiel likes the most boring pellets that I can find her - no stuff mixed in , no fruit flavoring , etc . She loves these .	1
Exactly what you would fine in stores , if you have bought this brand before its exactly what you are expecting and if not ask your vet because you should n't rely on a product review for your dog	1
My dog was eating a high end food with a high price tag and it just was n't working out ! My wallet was thinning but my dog became extremely miserable.My dog just moped around and had no energy and was becoming a real grump and very moody . I foolishly thought he was just getting older but that obviously was n't it.I picked up a bag of this food at my local supermarket and my dog Beau 's life came rushing back ! He has his energy back , he enjoys eating his food , plays and initiates play just like he used to , and his hair is super soft.My dog is a Maltese which is a toy breed , so I have to break the pieces in half with my fingers . Sort of a pain , might try little bits with beef by Smartblend next time.I would have liked to have purchased it here at Amazon but they only sold it in a small bag . But I researched the product here before I bought it elsewhere .	1
my dog does ! .When we rescued our puppy from North Shore Animal League , they said to use this brand of dog food . Our dog recently graduated from the puppy formula to the & # 34 ; adult & # 34 ; version , and thankfully , no digestion issues .	1
MY DOGS LOVE THIS FOOD TYPE WHERE THERE ARE SMALL CRUNCHY BITES AND LARGER SOFTER BITES . EVEN MY PICKY EATERS EAT IT .	1
Increases my old dog 's energy , keeps her weight in check . She is a large lab who is allergic to chicken , and while she 'll eat anything , she loves this turkey/deer blend better than all the standard brand foods I have tried . I 'm happy , too , that it is cheaper than many of the high-end pet store brands .	1
I mix this with the lamb and rice and the dogs love it . I have two dogs with sensitive stomachs and neither have had any problems with this .	1
If my dogs like like the taste of Purina One and they eat it , then there is not more that I can say except I trust Purina products . I am always looking out for the best products at a reasonable price and through the years Purina products have provided food that is healthy and balanced , at a reasonable price , and most importantly , my animals like the taste . Most of our dogs and cats live to their teen years , with two of our cats living to 19 and 20 years old , this I think I it in part due to Purina products .	1
My dog loves this food . We were getting him some really high-end grain free stuff but it costs a fortune so went looking for something a little more reasonable but with a half-decent ingredient list . This stuff lists turkey as the primary ingredient and while corn meal is also high on the list , it is not first and at 30 % protein , it has a better macronutrient profile than most dry dog foods . In short , seems to be the best compromise between cost , taste and quality .	1
I tried a small size bag purchased at the market and the way my two dogs loved the product I knew I needed a large bag . It was a pleasure to have it delivered . I and the dogs recommend it highly .	1
Good dog food , at least my thinks so . No Chinese products in the food . Good price too . Give it a try .	1
My dog comes running , this the first time I have gotten my dog to eat any dry dog food in her 8 years of life . she loves it and her digestive tract has never been better .	1
I have one very picky Shih tzu , and he actually loves this food.My pitbull loves it as well , seems to be the only food they both will eat.Been feeding this for about 4months now , hard to find in stores .	1
Having this product delivered just makes good sense - it 's less expensive , no need to carry the multiple smaller bags up to the 3rd floor , and I have plenty on hand for my little girls . They love this healthy product .	1
This is a great cat food . All 3 of my pure bred cats love it and it is the recommended food for my hedgehog as well . He chows a lot of it down considering his size !	1
All my cats love this food . a bit too much . some got fat and i had to portion their food !	1
This is a simple , nutritious food for cats of all ages . Having worked in a vet clinic for a couple years , I can safely tell you that Purina makes some of the best cat food in the business . My cats really enjoy eating this food as a palette cleanser between licking each other 's buttholes .	1
3 cats and at least 1 large possum enjoy this cat food at all times . I fill and outdoor feeder so they can eat whenever they are hungry .	1
My cat just gobbles this food up ! We were feeding my cat Scamp Fancy Feast dry cat food that he loved until the last bag . That food changed in shape , color and odor . It became offensive to me and the cat went on a hunger strike . So I had to do something and fast.My dog loves his Purina Smartblend dog food so I decided to switch my cat to their cat food . And I am so glad that I made the switch . The smell is not offensive , I like the tan and brown pieces in two different shapes.It has only been a little over a week since Scamp has been eating this new food and when he was at the Vet today , I was told what a luxurious coat my tabby cat has .	1
My cats are just as a picky eater as another cats.They love this brand of food.Unlike other food I 've I 've bought for them , they do n't over it .	1
Have trid many flavors , types of food . This one does not make my cats throw up or have the runs .	1
I bought into the hype about the premium cat foods . But now that we 're up to 5 cats , and the newest one refuses to eat kibble , I had to cut back somewhere . You would 've thought I plopped down a fresh salmon the way these cats chowed down this food . They actually pick through the so called & # 34 ; good stuff & # 34 ; to get to these pieces .	1
I love and recommend all Purina one smart blend cat foods . They are made with the highest quality and healthiest blends of product 's .	1
My cats love this and even my older 17 yr old cat which passed in 2012 was spunkier after eating this for a few weeks . When I could see the difference , I knew there was something to this . They eat the tuna and salmon flavor . One bowl of this along with one of the flat cans of moist Friskies food split between each cat is what was the guaged right amount for my two cats per day . They nibble on the dry cat food throughout the day , and look forward to the fresh moist food each morning and by the evening , it 's gone . Any more is too much ; less will render lots of complaints with loud meows before the evening 's done .	1
My inside kitties seem to really like this as their dry food . I 've been feeding it to them for over a year and they still seem to like it . I would recommend this for other indoor kitties .	1
I broke my leg a while back and because I have such limited mobility , I 've been using Amazon to order bulk supplies like cat food that I 'd normally pick up locally . I was pleased to find my cats ' regular brand of cat food for the same price I 'd pay at my neighborhood big-box store . They like this flavor and it does n't seem as prone to causing diarrhea or & # 34 ; stinky poo & # 34 ; as some of the cheaper brands .	1
My kitten loves this food . It also does not have a ton of dye in it like some food so when she has thrown up a couple of times ( after eating pieces of plants . Naughty kitty ! ) it has not stained the carpet like some food I 've used in the past .	1
My 3 cats only love this food - and I 've tried a lot of different ( cheaper ) cat foods . Good Buy .	1
I purchased this item on a wish list for the Michigan Humane Society but never used it myself . They must have used it in the past and had good luck with it and that is why is was on their wishlist .	1
I 've used this cat food since my 14-year-old boy cat was a one-year-old . He 's never had any digestion type health problems , until a couple of months ago when I fed him a cheaper Purina with with more fiber for a week . ( The grocery store was out of this food . It was on sale . ) I had to start feeding him wet food every day , and I quickly went back to this food . It only has 2.0 % fiber , probably the lowest of any dry cat food . Due to the low fiber and having chicken as the first ingredient , it also can be used with ferrets . Although if you want a higher protein and fat amount , more like what is recommended for young ferrets , mix this withPurina One Cat Healthy Kitten Formula Cat Food , 16-Pound , or just use the kitten food . Price wise , this large bag from Amazon was a pretty good deal when I bought it at first -- $ 27 , with free shipping . That 's about $ 3 more than what it sells for in a local grocery store , if you can find it in a grocery store . Now , it 's somewhat more , so it 's not the best deal here , unless you ca n't find it locally , or just want the convenience of mail delivery . ( All bags arrived within just a few days . ) Buying a big bag online is cheaper , however , than buying small bags locally . The local cost of the 3.5 pound bags of this cat food is now $ 8.99 .	1
my cat prefers this . her coat got beautiful when I first started feeding her this	1
My kittens love this food ! Only fed this for the first year . It 's right up there with the high-end foods . They 're 1 year old now , but I still feed this because I think it 's better than the adult formula - more protein . I 've started mixing it with another brand of a no grain formula dry food . It even smells pretty good .	1
I normally get this from Petco , but it 's a little cheaper here . And it 's nice to not have to make a trip just to get it .	1
My cats love this food ... and the price is right . ( usually a bit cheaper than any store ) If you 'll read the ingredients , the FIRST ingredient is not chicken meal or some by product , it 's real chicken ! ! The cats love it , and it 's very nutritious . We took this bag to our Veterinarian and showed him what our cats were eating ... he was pleased and said go ahead and feed them this..and he had tons of food in his office he could 've tried to sell us for our one cat 's sensitive tummy . He said this food is great ! ! We wo n't feed them anything else !	1
great and my kitties love it . they finish it in no time and waiting for more . glad I got the product for them	1
I have three cats -- one is 19 years old and arthritic , one is 4 and has occasional urinary tract problems , and my `` baby '' , one year old , has allergies resulting in exzema and diarrhea ! This is the only dry cat food I 've found that works for all three ! It took a few days for them to become accustomed to it but now they all love it . Please , Purina , never change this formula !	1
My cats are very fussy about their dry food . This product is enjoyed by all four of them . Makes mealtime easier , for sure .	1
My cats , all under 10 months old , all love this food.I mix it up , dry , with a Science Diet kibble , one to one , and they eat every last crumb in the bowl . They commonly do n't pick up pieces from the floor , but I wo n't hold that against them . I do not mix this with water , so it never gets soggy . The bowls are often completely empty in the morning . This is in addition to the canned cat food I give to all 6 cats . They eat their fill of the called , and even leave some behind , if it is not up to their standards , but they never leave any of this dried food behind.My cat 's love it .	1
I buy this on a regular basis . My rescue cat was a scraggly mess . Her fur was dull and falling out . This food had worked for us before and it really did for this kitten . She is now super shiney and loves the food . Have tried other Purina One Beyond flavors but she likes this one the best .	1
My cats love this product and it is nearly impossible to find in the area I live . So happy to get it now and have it sent right to my home . Happy cats at my house .	1
I get this through subscribe & save , which makes it cheaper than getting it anywhere else . The cats seem to like it , which is important . Salmon is the first ingredient , and chicken is the 2nd , which means more protein stays in the cat and less comes out later .	1
At the risk of getting chastised by pet-foodies , let me just say that I am very susceptible to the creative guilt-inducing marketing schemes by organic or whole-foods pet food brands . I have had pets and loved animals all my life , and of the five pets that I have , four of them are rescues . I have also fostered animals before because I could n't bear to bring them to a shelter where they might be euthanized.That much being said about me , I am also a teacher , and can not afford the $ 35-per-5-lb-bag of top-of-the-line pet food to feed five animals . I also did n't want to feed my pets `` junk food , '' like the stuff that is mostly chemicals and corn meal . I fretted about this for a while until I discovered Purina One Beyond . Real chicken is the first ingredient on the list . It also contains vitamins and nutrients that my furry children need to stay healthy . Is it as perfect as certain other brands ? No , but with this food , my pets check out in excellent health at their vet visits . They are maintaining a healthy weight , clean teeth , and shiny coats . And I can afford to feed them this brand . This is exactly what I need in a pet food , so 5 stars .	1
my dog like his kibbles more than treats ( he LOVES to eat ! ! ) , and with this sprinkled on top of his food , he refuses to eat . the smell is super strong even I pull away my head when I open the jar.And , even when i hand fed him the food , he still tried to play with his poop . ( granted , he consumed smaller portion than the recommended by the direction ) Overall , it may keep dogs away from their poop because they can smell this in their poop , but that same smell is present on their food , which obviously repells them.So , I do not recommend this product unless your dog eats EVERYTHING .	-1
This product did n't work for my dogs at all , and the smell of it was difficult to put up with ( for me ) . It smelled like a Christmas candy cane gone all wrong . I put it in front of them on their ( dry ) food , I 've never seen two dogs so sad to eat their food in my life . My dogs usually chow down their food really fast . Eventually I started mixing it with a bit of pumpkin to make it more tolerable for them . In the end thogh , it did n't work and my only solution seems to be keep an eye on them like a hawk when they 're out ( in the fenced on yard ) and dispose of the poop within a minute of it hitting the ground .	-1
waste of money ... does not work for my shepherd and must taste nasty as he does not like his food as much . Worth a try but did not work for me . He still eats poop ... ugh .	-1
I fed it to my german shepard . My dachshund still eats his poop . It does not work It does not work	-1
Save your money , not worth the price . This did not work on my dogs and I would not recommend it at all .	-1
Used the whole jar and my dog still is eating his poop . It was hard to get the dog to eat its food as they did not like the SEP in there foodIt 's worth trying but it may not do the trick	-1
I purchased 2 of these Blitz lavender and cream colored bins at PetSmart years ago . I use them for dry dog food . I was pleased to find a matching one on Amazon as I now have more to store . ( I subscribe to Amazon premium dry dog foods , which is both a great bargain and convenience ) . Yes , some of the food can tumble out when the bin is full and you have the bin positioned as shown . If you turn it so that the door is on top , the problem is solved . My dogs can not get into these containers , nor do vermin . I have found them very durable , and you can clean them as you like every so often with bleach or alcohol or whatever product you prefer . One of the main reasons that I like these is that they are actually pleasant to look at . You can also open the door with one hand . I have small dogs , so food lasts fairly long . If I had larger dogs , I would probably opt for a larger container . I have just ordered another from Amazon . Until I read the reviews , I had not considered using them for anything but dogfood - but I might consider how they could help me with other storage needs.My package just arrived , and much to my disgust it contained a Bergen storage bin ( does n't match ) in a color that it ugly to me . I have messaged the seller . I ordered from BLITZ , and it was filled by Grady.Amazon , please tell your sellers that they are not allowed to do this .	-1
I have one of these that I have had for years and love it . Wanted to order another and needed the one that will hold 40lbs . In the title this one states Size : 40lbs . However ... .this one is TINY and no way that it will hold 40lbs . In the further description it says that it holds 27-29lbs ( which I did n't read as I stopped at the title ) but I am hesitant to believe that it even holds that much . So if you are looking to put a 15lb bag of food in this ... no problem.That is the only reason for the one star . Other than that the product is great for it 's purposes . It is not intended to be air tight . It is easily opened with an arm full of dishes , etc .	-1
I have one female cat that weighs under 10 pounds and is about 15 years old . I had used EverClean for years and really had no complaints . Last year our cat , Poloma , started to urinate more frequently and my back was starting to hurt when I bent down to clean the clumps.I had seen the LitterMaid litter box advertised for several years and had always wondered if it could really be true and work as it was advertised . Sorry , I finally gave in and purchased along with the tent top.The tent top came with several pieces missing/broken . I called the company who asked me to fax the part numbers so they could forward them to me . They sent me the wrong parts and I have not been able to get around to ask for them again . I will though.The machine seems to work to not on the clumps of urine . I have to now clean the clumps out DAILY rather than every few days . The machine tries but is too weak to push , lift and dump . INstead I walk into the room only to see the red blinking light which indicates a jam.I called the company and explained my problem . The only advice they could give me was to be sure and use a quality clumping litter . I would have though the high price I pay for Litter Green would have been considered quality clumping litter . I am now looking for my fouth `` quality litter '' that might work with my single cat.As usual , if it looks too good to be true , it probably is .	-1
I bought 2 when I just got my kittens , they did work well for a couple of weeks maybe a month without a big issueVery noisy , a mess to change the containers , litter gets stuck all over the parts and the engine runs back and forth for hours ! ! Better than Purrforma	-1
Current version of littermaid does not work well at all . The first one I purchased lasted for five years and I was very happy with it . The pet store only had the larger version when I replaced the original . The larger version lasted for 15 months and then died.I found the old version ( on Amazon ) . It worked for six days and then died . It was replaced at no charge . The second one worked for six weeks and then died . I have been told it is not possible to get my money back because it has been more that 30 days since the original purchase . So now I am out a wad of money and have to run the box manually.DO NOT buy this product . This system forced me to give this product at least one star , I would give it -5 if I could .	-1
We have from two to four cats at a time in our home , and managing the litter box is something we want to be as easy as possible . This LitterMaid LM500 Automated Litter Box was the first automated solution we tried . I 'm afraid it was n't our last , as it had numerous problems.First , the tines would get clumped full of stuff and it would get caked solid rather quickly . I 'll note that we did n't even try having this be the `` only '' litter box in our home ! We had two others there too . We just wanted to see how well this worked . The storage container would get jammed in the open position , so that it did not do a good job of managing stench.However , we could have dealt with those issues . We could have cleaned the tines daily , and pushed down the lid ourselves regularly . The real problem was far more serious.First , understand how this works . The system sense motion and then X minutes after the cat has left the area , the tines move across , dragging any solids and clumps with it , pushing those items into the receptacle plastic box at the far end . Then the tines return to their original position and wait for a new visit.What happened with our unit would be that the tines would decide that they were ALWAYS ON and would keep going back and forth , back and forth , driving the poor kitties to distraction . There was no way they were going to jump in there and try to do their business while a set of metal tines was growling towards them ! We tried several times to fix this , but it really just was n't worth it . We moved on to other options and found a GREAT one . This one went in the trash as we could n't even imagine subjecting any other cat owner to it . A large waste of money.Not well recommended.I 'll give it 2/5 stars on the assumption that some units do NOT do that random motion thing - but it would only take one fritz in a lifetime to really demolish a cat 's desire to ever use the unit again : )	-1
I have owned two of these ... the first was replaced for free by Walmart where I purchased it for the same price as here . They are complex structures and I can not imagine anyone who is not a handy man owning one for long . I am and I find it a very poor implementation of a good design idea.The good ... it works and it keeps the bin ready for the next use.The bad ... it does not work for long before things get weak and then ultimately break it . The thing still gets messed up and cleaning all the little corners and angles is a dirty job and it can not be done with a hose because all the electronics are not protected in any way from water . It is not a substitute when one goes away for more than 2 days . I have two cats using this and not full time . I needs to be emptied every two days . You must use good quality clumping litter . The replacement canisters are expensive if you do not reuse them . In fact , it is cheaper to just use a coventional litter pan and throw away the whole thing litter and all instead of using the refuse containers as throw away items . The lids will fall off and need to be taped in place.My unit burned out when one of the cats pulled out the power cord at the end of the unit . It just kept getting fuller and fuller and I was gone for a few days . Even though it is supposed to be protected from running when blocked , when I returned I found the unit almost extended to the refuse bin and the stupid wire which hangs out in the middle of the box had been tangled by one of the poor cats trying to use the unit when it broke . BAD DESIGN ! I am ordering one of the rocking style units and returning my second unit.By the way , the best litter boxes have strong curves at all corners so they are easy to clean . Keep that in mind .	-1
I read all the GREAT reviews here and laid out the money to purchase this item . It 's been a little over a year now and I 'm about to throw mine out.The rake is a pain to clean ... especially if your pet ever has diarrhea ( which mine did the first six months after we saved him from the pound ) . The rake also is super sensitive to overload and will go back and forth 3 or 4 times before giving up and flashing -- essentially jammed and unusable until you physically scoop the problem away , clean the rake and reset it . The sound of the rake going back and forth at all hours of the night is NOT a nice one and no matter what they say , this thing is STILL LOUD ! You have to be really carefully about how much litter you put in the box and if your cat is like my boy and has a good size bladder you 're in trouble.I purchased the tent to go with this , but did n't keep it on because it gets nasty too ... and I read that cats do n't like to go to the bathroom in an enclosed space any more than we like porta potties ! The cost of the plastic containers is prohibitative but at least they can be used over again . I usually scooped my plastic container and left it in until I cleaned the entire box out -- about once a month.If you have a small cat that is in perfect health and has nice neat tiddy excrement than maybe this product would work for you . As for me , I 'm looking for a nice LARGE size old fashion litter box	-1
When I received the Littermate it did not work . I called Littermate customer service . Tech support tried to reconcile the problem , but could not . So , they did replace it , for $ 10 more and I had to send them a bunch of proof of purchase stuff . At any rate , they did send me a new one , but it is very finicky , it sometimes works , even with premium clumping litter , it works sporadically , For such a costly product , it is disappointing .	-1
First off , it seems that someone is spamming the reviews . Each of these glowing reviewers has never reviewed anything else on Amazon . And when a bad review is posted you 'll see several days worth of great reviews to push off the bad ones . [ edit : Note the new `` Amazon verified purchase '' label ! Beware of the glowing review from people who have not purchased this item . ] Let me say , this is the biggest pile of junk you 'll ever waste you 're money on . Even with high quality clumping litter it did not work . The rake would get clogged . The receptacle would n't close . Litter stuck all over the place and in the tracks even though we were well below the `` fill line . '' We spent more time cleaning this piece of junk than a regular litter box . In less than a month we threw it out in the garbage.Do not waste your time and money on this product . Stick with the regular litter , you 'll be glad you did .	-1
I previously had a Mega which worked a couple years . This one was a Total Disaster . Never could get rake to work , Littermaid customer service ( once you finally get to is ) was of little help and Orange Onion ( do n't buy anything from them ) sucked . They could n't care less , at least Littermaid apologized ( on one of my three calls ) . Keep in mind , if you buy it and return it , do it through Littermaid . You only need to send back the battery cover and that blasted pull wire . To get that out ( NO help from Littermaid ! ) , unscrew every single screw and once you get your hands on that wire , do n't let it go ! Or you have to take out the rest of the screws by the battery compartment . I wasted hours and hours on this . If only they had a good competitor . They 're sending me the only thing available , the latest model that most people here seem to hate . sigh..if it does n't work , I 'm giving up totally on Littermaid . I have two cats , so it had its uses .	-1
I saw this item advertised for a few years and always wondered if such a device could work . I have one 12 year old cat who has begun to urinate more often . I really never had a problem with her litter box until I hurt my back.I decided to bite the bullet and shell out $ ( ... ) for what looked like a solution to both her more frequent pees and my aching back . Unfortunately , the product did not work . It would rake the premium clumpable litter but could not get the ball of pee into the receptacle before getting jammed and backing off and attempting once again only to fail and return to its original position with the error light blinking.I contacted manufacturer by email only to be offered the feeble suggestion to try several other litter . I went out and purchased three different premium clumpable litters and none faired better.PS . Tent is not any better . I also purchased a tent that is made to surround the litter box only to find several pieces for assembly so flimsy they broke . I contacted manufacturer who asked me to email the part numbers and quantity needed . I did and they sent me the WRONG parts.BSN	-1
I found out about these litterboxes by going into a pet store for cat supplies when I adopted my cat back in 2005 . I liked the idea that I no longer would have to worry about having to scoop out cat waste or have a strong cat waste smell in my home . I bought the LM920 which I found to have a quiet and decent motor . Unfortunately , it only lasted about three years . Then I bought the LM900 as the LM920 was no longer made even though it is superior to the LM900 and quieter . The first LM900 I bought lasted about a year and half , and I found the motor noisy and not very sturdy . The second LM900 lasted about a year . I bought the third LM900 and it only lasted two days before the rake stopped in the dumping into the receptacle mode and would n't move anymore . I had to unscrew the rake so I could empty the receptacle which was full of lovely cat waste , dump the current amount of cat litter and return it to Amazon so I could get a replacement . The replacement one broke also with the rake in the upright position so again , I had to unscrew the rake to get to the almost full receptacle to dump it out . Do n't bother buying the Littermaid LM900 model as it is obviously does n't last . I went and bought the latest version of the Littermaid which is a LME9000 and it is better with a timer so the rake does n't run during during a 9 hour duration but I still run into the rake getting stuck at various times and it also pushes unused litter into the receptacle . I go through way more litter now which is frustrating but it does seem to have a stronger motor .	-1
I should have read the reviews before purchasing.This is incredibly finicky about precise fill level . I must have overfilled by 1/4 '' or so , because it stopped working properly after the first day . The scooper still scooped but the thing seldom opened the lid of the receptacle.With such shallow litter , my cats had trouble digging and covering.The fact that a scoop is included in the package is informative.I gave it two stars instead of one because the charcoal filter does a good job of odor control . And another clock in the house is always handy .	-1
I have two cats , I bought this to help keep things clean and tidy , well it was a disaster and here is why.There is a MAJOR design flaw in this litter box , it has no solid scoop only a rake-like feature to pick up the cat waste . Well that is lovely if the waste is n't in any way still damp but if it is watch out ! With the rake-like feature it dug through the waste and stuck in the scooper all the time . Then it would reverse and push the unscooped waste into the mechanisim and it was just gross ! I was useing premium clumping litter so it was n't the litter . I spent more time cleaning this litter box than I did the old fashion kind . I finally threw this thing away after about 6-12 months of trying to deal with it . I went out and bought an old fashioned covered box , it is cleaner , smells better and does n't constantly jam the way my Littermaid did.Maybe if you have one cat of small to average size or even two small cats this thing will work fine but if you have a large cat or multiple large cats this thing is a disaster !	-1
I have gone through 2 of these in 5 years . NEVER again will I purchase a a Littermaid . This model died Monday after 2-1/2 years , but had been having problems with the rake running continuously until it finally cut off . The cord finally snapped on Monday . Not only the short lifespan considering the price , but I found myself spending nearly as much time cleaning the box as I did a regular old litter pan . No matter what litter brand I tried , it adhered like mud to the bottom of the pan , would stick to the rake , and eventually cause the machine to cut off.Just purchased an Omega Paws , which has very good reviews and am eagerly awaiting its arrival today so the Littermaid can get tossed.Good idea , very poor longterm performance .	-1
This machine never worked the way it was advertised to . It can not handle urine , the urine clumps and scooper gets caught on it . This stresses the motor out to were it resets itself , thus not scooping anything . Or if it does break through it , the clump crumbles to small enough pieces where it slips through the scooper and quickly starts to stink . I tried five different types of litter , nothing improved the machines performance . I ended up keeping a hand scooper and plastic bags available as I had to scoop and clean it myself . The plastic mounts on the scooper ended up snapping of after two months of use . The box is just messy and useless and hard to wash as you have to disassemble it . You might as well buy litter tray for $ 5 , it will function 100 times better . I use a plastic concrete mixing tray you can get at home depot for $ 6 . It looks just like a litter tray except it is about 2 ' x 3 ' . If you got the room this is the way to go.If you decide to buy this auto-box save the receipt . You will need itIf you want a good auto-box , get the one that uses the disposable trays with the blue crystals . That is a good auto-box .	-1
I bought this product for $ 66 at Meijers . The cats loved it and so did I , for the first 6 hours . The kitty poo poo stuck to the rake , caused a jam and the entire rotating arm broke in a matter of hours . I was so bummed . It would have made life so much easier . Numerous reviews stated that the poos need to dry before they get raked . This is true ! C'mon you engineers . This is the only product I would advocate animal testing on . Great idea but a real mess to clean up . It is getting returned tomorrow . : (	-1
Worked great for a week . What a waste of $ 200 ( I got the `` Mega '' ) . ****update*****After my disaster with the Mega I broke down and bought the `` LitterRobot '' for $ 400 ( I travel and an automated litterbox is a must , not an option ) . Extremely well built but the cats wo n't get near it . The kitten loves it but is n't heavy enough to `` trip '' it so I have to initiate the cycle myself ( not handy when I 'm gone ) . I saw the `` Plus '' version of the LitterMaid at Walmart for $ 88 and decided to give it a try . What a little dynamo . It 's smaller than the Mega but it almost seems like the motor size was the same . Everything the Mega did was a struggle but in this smaller version it 's doing great ! ! ! ! This has been a godsend . The `` Plus model '' can plow through anything . Takes up much less room ( note to the LitterMaid designers- bigger may have sounded like a better sell but my cats only get in it one at a time ) . And if it goes out , at least it was n't $ 200 . This version gets FIVE STARS from me !	-1
The plastic rake is spaced in a way that it wo n't work with my , and my cat 's , favorite litter . Yes it 's a clumping litter . Also the tongs on the rake are very wide . This litterbox scoops a lot of clean litter into the bin ( even with the smallest clumping litter I could find ) . It wastes a LOT of litter , pretty much just indiscriminately scooping everything in it 's path into the bin ... more of a shovel , than a rake IMO . In order to not waste more litter than is used , I would have to dump out the bin and scoop that in order to save the wasted clean litter ... . far more of a hassle than useful.I would not repurchase this item , nor would I recommend it to a friend ... . an enemy ... . maybe .	-1
We currently have four always indoors cats , we have had as many as six at one time . We have owned as many as two Litter Maids at one time and experienced the same problem with all of them . First the solid waste sticks to the forks and is difficult to clean . Second the trays are expensive and messy to change . I see where they are now giving you 18 trays for about the same price we were paying for twelve , but at over $ 1.00 each they are still too much.We recently bought a Scoop Free and are more than happy with it . It works as advertised and even though the replacement cartridges are expensive , they last a long time and actually cost us less than we were paying for litter alone . We have now bought a second Scoop Free and find we only use three cartridges a month , and have never had to clean it except for waste that has gotten on the sides that needs to be wiped off , but we would have that problem no matter what type of box we used.If you are thinking about buying an automatic litter box I would suggest you buy the Scoop Free instead of this one . With the ninety-day money-back guarantee you have nothing to loose and I believe you will not want to return it.See my full review of the Scoop Free by going to the product or my clicking on `` See all of my review '' link here .	-1
Works just fine but no longer in use . It Crapped out after about six months .	-1
We bought this item 2 months ago and it quit working after one month.We used the premium litter but the `` cat material '' clumped up and the rake could n't move it . It created a real mess.Also , it sounded like a loud , dying chainsaw whenever it was doing it 's thing . It was just struggling to move even the tiniest amount of stuff .	-1
The tent is made of two parts assembled with a zipper , that fit around a structure made of flimsy hollow plastic rods . The problem lies in the structure , which is not strong enough to withstand the weight of an average cat . If your cat likes exploring and climbing on top of things like most cats do , the frame will break quickly.If you 're minimally handy , you can very easily make yourself a much better structure using PVC piping and joints ( they 're inexpensive and can be found in the plumbing section of any hardware store ) . If your cat is heavy and a climber , I would strongly suggest not even bothering with the supplied frame and building your own right away.Another irritating problem is that replacing the waste receptacles is extremely inconvenient when the littermaid is in the tent.All in all , unless you absolutely have to hide the littermaid , this tent is poorly designed and more trouble than it 's worth .	-1
One of my cats absolutely refused to enter it , and did his `` business '' next to the litterbox instead . The big guy flattened it , and a couple of others hated it so much they made a point of spraying it and trying to wipe their butts on it . Needless to say , it ended up in the garbage . It 's not that these cats wo n't use a covered box -- they will and do -- they just really , really hated this tent .	-1
I am fairly disappointed with this after being so pleased w/the stand . The tent is short and most cats like stand up straight to poo . Also , the velcro already attached ( not nearly enough to do anything ) to the tent releases when attached to the velco pad we must attach to the stand . Lastly the tent is to help keep the litter from spreading , which this does not do . there are only four 1-inch patches of velcro , the rest is open for the litter to fall all around the unit . Do n't waste your $ $ on this accessory .	-1
I 've had LitterMaid 's since they first came out , and had the very first LitterMaid privacy ( and litter containing ) tent . That tent has finally bit the dust - the fabric had been washed so many times that it was getting holes in the fabric . So I bought a new one . What an enormous mistake . The new ones do not fit the frame in any way , shape or form . I tapped all the connections with a hammer so that they were all tight , and then tried to put the tent on the frame - there is a 1 inch gap between the top and the bottom and they ca n't be zippered together ! ! ! So I tried to massage it on - moved more fabric to the front , got the zipper started - and the zipper separated . Okay , put the zipper back together and try again - the slider became deformed and would no longer fit onto the zipper pin . The metal slider itself started to come apart . What a horrible piece of unmitigated JUNK . Do n't waste your money unless LitterMaid announces a major redesign of their litter tents . It 's sad , the first one was flimsy but worked great and fit properly . Someone , somewhere , cut a few too many corners on this product . The hole kit and caboodle is now residing in the trash .	-1
the privacy tent is a very clever item.well made , out of good materials , but highly impractical.the privacy issue with your cat is much less an issue thanbeing able to keep the electronic cat box clean and workingproperly.this tent makes it virtually impossible to see what 's happenedin the box , and to smooth the litter around now and then.this is something you 'll need to be able to do.i bought it , but wound up lining the bottom with a blanket , and a few toys.my cats sleep and play in it .	-1
We purchased one of these tents a number of years ago and it is still going strong . This one arrived with cracked support rods ( different material than original ) and the plastic is stiff and brittle . Contacted seller about rods and they promised to send replacement . After waiting quite some time , seller advised that their supplier was out of these and issued a credit . Nothing wrong with the seller other than slow on the follow up - the product is just not the quality of the original models .	-1
I waited over a year to review this item to make a proper review . The plastic is of that of a grill cover or patio furniture cover . The PVC frame that came with it did n't fit properly so my husband used a saw to modify it to be assembled correctly which was disappointing . It does n't keep any smell inside and is simply used to avoid making eye contact with your cat while they are using it . I threw the bottom portion away since it was too much trouble to zipper the thing on and off when I did thorough cleaning . Not a fan	-1
Cheap 'n ' cheezy , just like all the newer LitterMaid receptacles are . Sure wish they would bring back the older , sturdier ones . Really makes you feel like a captive market , since you do n't have much choice but to use these if you want to use the LitterMaid . I line them with bags , but the receptacles are so thin that they crack and split after about 3-4 uses just from putting them into and taking them out of the LitterMaid , so have to be replaced despite being lined .	-1
They fill up too quick , they 're too flimsy and litter can fall out , they get stuck too easily . On top of that , they 're too expensive and too wasteful . Stick with plastic bags , or better yet , toss your Littermaid and get a better litter box .	-1
These receptacles offer poor value for the money , and are constructed of very cheap , flimsy plastic.Pros : Necessary for LitterMaid self-cleaning litter boxes.Cons : Cheap & flimsy plastic.Do not fit tightly.Too small.Do not keep out odor.Poor customer support.If you have a LitterMaid self-cleaning litter box ; you 'll have little choice but to purchase these . They function reasonably well at collecting cat waste , but are poorly designed . The problem is that they 're made of very flimsy plastic and the design makes it impossible to get a tight fit when placing them in the LitterMaid box . The charcoal filter does virtually nothing to eliminate odors , and with the lack of a tight fit , the odors are very noticeable . In addition ; this company has poor customer support .	-1
These receptacles are the only ones that fit and seem to work in the Littermaid automatic litterbox . They are very cheaply made and crack and break easily . In addition , the tops get crinkled and often do n't go up with the little flap that raises it when the sweeper is being used.I 've found a solution for both that works for me . First I tape two of these receptacles together using a clear packing tape.Scotch 3-Inch Core Mailing & Storage Tape , 48 x 50 Millimeter ( 4 Pack ) ( Scotch tape comes off too easily ) I hold them tightly together and use several pieces of tape in various places around the top . It then looks like one more substantial receptacle . I use an old plastic grocery bag like some other people have mentioned so I can reuse it several times and it 's less mess . I then tape the little bubble things that poke through the top of the flap on the litter box and to the flap . ( On the outside ) This holds them in place when the flap goes up during operation . It eliminates the problem of the receptacle lid not going up with the flap and litter accumulating in front of the box.2/28/09 - I 've found a better and neater solution . Get one of these kits and you 'll never have to buy another flimsy receptacle or cover.PERMA-lid & BAG-it Combo Waste Receptacle Replacement System for Littermaid Litter BoxI 've used mine for about a week and it works great . I 've posted a review there .	-1
If litter maid makes these , why is the quality so much worse on these than on the ones that come with the actual machine ? Wait , maybe I can answer that ... .they do n't want you to return that machine so they are a bit deceptive about the quality of their receptacles for your initial purchase . Come on ... come on companies !	-1
The receptacles I got with my first Littermaid ( for multiple cats ) were very flimsy . The replacement box of 12 ( as shown ) I got afterward were also flimsy . This did not stop us from reusing the trays over and over . It does n't make sense not to , but eventually they get pretty brutalised from removal and reinsertion.Oddly enough , when we got our second LitterMaid ( regular sized ) the receptacles that came with it were sturdier and more durable . Why they arent all manufactured at this thickness is beyond me . Actually , I 'm sure it 's a case of trying to get more money out of us at cheaper manufacturing cost , but it 's a little ridiculous when they are that flimsy .	-1
There are three main problems with this product . The first is that it does not fit the littermaid box well at the base ( where the box fits into the botoom ) . As a result you end up with some cat litter on the floor as a result , instead of all of it in this product . Secondly , the top part does not fit into the top well . Some effort required to get it in properly . Thirdly , the product is made of very weak plastic . As a result , if it is filled up , it bends quite a bit ( to the point where it makes handling a chore ) . Higher quality/harder plastic should have been used to avoid this problem .	-1
When I received this Ball , I was surprised how big it was , considering it was a 'small ' dog toy.My 9 month old puppy ( Pug & Jack Russel Terrier Mix ) chewed it apart in 30 min . It was a waste of my money .	-1
This was bigger than expected ( my bad , the size is listed ) so it was too big for my dogs .	-1
This `` wiggly giggly '' ball was very disappointing . I ordered the first one that seemed to be defective , which of course amazon was quick to replace . The second one came and was no better than the first one . It would only make those cute little noises if I shook it like a crazy person , but as soon as I would roll it for my little dog , it went mute . He lost interest in it pretty fast after that so it went back . I would have kept it for just a regular ball for him but at almost $ 12 , I thought that was a little pricey for a do nothing ball .	-1
It takes a lot of work to find the exact roll that will cause one very brief squeacK . The dog will seldom if ever find it . My dog is n't at all interested . It 's a total loss as far as I can see . If a person ca n't even make it work ... ... ... I only gave it one star because there 's no way to give NO STARS .	-1
My dog loved this toy and he got a lot of use out of it . The only problem is the he shredded it the whole time . It was a disaster within hours . The rubber is like a cheap dollar store sqeek toy . He still wanted to play with it , but almost choked on a loose piece , so we had to throw it away . Not worth the money .	-1
At first it looked like it was going to work great ( when the litter was clean ) . After a day or so , it was n't cleaning very well . I got better litter and it started working better , but still not great . Litter gets in the crevices and gets stuck to the rake . After about two weeks of use , the rake stopped moving backwards . I tried to fix it , but it just wo n't go in reverse . Overall , this was a big waste of time and money . I 'm not even going to try to get another one . A good old fashioned litter box with good clumping litter is less work than trying to get this thing to work properly while keeping it clean . It 's too bad as it had a promising beginning . DO NOT BUY .	-1
When I first purchased the LitterMaid , I was pleased . I never had a mechanical problem and my first couple of months with the product were uneventful . However , I soon found that it created much more work and hassel than a traditional litter box with plastic liners.One problem I faced was that if the storage bin became full , the clumps would pile up and the lid would not close . Sometimes , the clumps would even spill out of the side of the bin , creating a stinky mess . This problem was exacerbated by the fact that my cats had a tendency to use only one side of the litter box , so the bin would be full on that side in a short amount of time , causing extreme odor and spills . And , with 2 cats , it does not take long to fill that little storage bin , so if you have multiple cats , plan to empty it every couple of days.In addition , I found that the bottom of the box and the rake needed to be cleaned frequently so that they did not accumulate a build-up of crusty litter . If a build-up occurs on the bottom of the box , it will eventually become thick and hard enough that the rake will not be able to pass smoothly through the litter . After chiseling the dried litter off of the bottom of the box a few times ( gross ! ) and dealing with the hassel of having to shake the contents of the storage bin in order to level it out , I finally decided that all of this hassel was not worth it and literally THREW THIS PRODUCT AWAY ! I have never regretted the transition back to an old fashioned litter box , but I DO regret the money I spent on the LitterMaid !	-1
after i bought a top-rated , well-reviewed gps receiver that could n't find a satellite with both hands inside a telephone booth , i thought i could never possibly waste money that badly again.was i wrong . ( note : that is not a question . ) from first use , the thing was either raking or it was off . i could not get it to stop . even if the cat was in the box and touching the `` sensor '' ( yes , those are irony quotes ) , it just kept on plugging away . i turned it on manually when i went in to feed the cats until i had time to call customer service the following weekend . the rep sounded completely unsurprised that i was having this problem and gave me some simple steps to follow to get it to work : unplug it , lift the top part ( the lighter beige you see in the photos , which is clipped to the box by two little green-grey tabs on the sides -- you can see the little square on the side in the photo ) off the bottom part , and run your finger along the track that the wheels follow until you find the reset button . click it on and off maybe 5-10 times , and it 'll work after that . she told me that i might have to do this 5-10 times for it to work ( why 5-10 times ? why both things 5-10 times ? mysteries of life ) , but that it would work . ( i explained all the other troubleshooting things i 'd done , which are described clearly in the manual . ) well , here we are 25 days after ordering , so probably three weeks into daily use . i still have to turn it on and off manually . now , that would n't be a HUGE deal , since i 'm in there anyway feeding the kittehs . however , because i ca n't sense when it 's been 10 minutes since either cat went in , i have to hope that the clumps are fully formed . i think it has happened that way for me twice . the rest of the times , the mushy clod of unclumped kitty-pee mixed with the clay litter sticks to the rake as it goes through its little journey . also does n't sound like HUGE deal , does it ? well ... turns out that the rake does n't hit the aforementioned sensors until it goes alllll the way to the receptacle end and then allll the way to the resting end . and it ca n't push through the litter if a big ol ' piece of you-know-what is blocking the openings between the rake 's teeth . so every time it runs now , i have to sit beside it and use the little toothed plastic scoop to try to get all the gunk out from between the teeth . usually it still has n't pushed the litter into an even surface by then , so the litter forms little dunes at either end , and it ca n't get up into the resting position . and i do n't want to leave it partially out of the resting position , because that 's down the side of the box into the ... work area , and a kitteh will ... work on it . so i spend at least as much time as i 'd spend scooping a regular box that size to get it cleared out all the way , getting the glued-to-the-bottom gunk out , and cleaning the rake until i can get it far enough up out of the box that nothing will get on it.and the return policy is that you have to return the item in its original condition and packaging . well , i got yer packaging right here , but i am prettty sure that this does not qualify as original condition . oh , did i mention that the gunk gets all up on the track and the sides of the rake ? so those have to be cleaned off with a paper towel or something every few days.the good news is that the cats took to it right away -- one of them with no urging at all ( in fact , while i was still setting it up ) , and the other when the old box got dirty enough . the bad news is that i 'm losing my patience with this contraption and putting it out with the trash any minute . the big boxes -- which are easy to scoop , even if that 's no fun -- are much easier for me . and for now they 're in closets or otherwise out of the way , rather than having to be plugged in in the main room.when our third bathroom is finished , i 'm aiming for a cat genie , the box with the washable granules that flushes fluid waste away and scoops the poop into a receptacle . it 's three times the price of the littermaid , but i 'm betting it wo n't be worse than this . ( i ca n't remember ever writing a negative review before for a product , and certainly not one this negative . think how ..fill in your favorite adjective here.. i must have been to get back on amazon to look for this product again just to write this review . sad . )	-1
I bought this for my older cat and now have gone back to a regular plastic box . It is just too small for turn-around room , thus he urinated several times on top of the box and ramp , with urine leaking in between the space where the ramp connects . It is difficult to clean although I used premium litter . I wish I 'd paid more attention to the negative reviewers and saved my money .	-1
I was betrayed by a dog `` expert '' that swears by these that they 're the greatest thing ever . I suspect Planet Dog has in fact betrayed them by letting their quality control slip . The green parts are glued on , but not very well . I do n't leave any toys with my dog unsupervised but my puppy ripped Australia off and swallowed it in only a minute of play . Several of the other continents are peeling off and hanging my a thread . I felt like returning the ball with the green piece , poop and all .	-1
I remember the high pitched , `` Oh no , Mr. Bill '' famous phrase . This does n't sound like him ; it did n't smell right to me ; and my 27 lbs mini golden gutted him in less than five minutes . I had big fiber looking cotton balls all over the floor in minutes . Cute for ... nothing . Save your funds and buy some bones . I do NOT recommend for dogs with teeth .	-1
The frog and duck toys held up so well that I decided to get the teddy bear ( it is SO cute ) . Poor Mr. Bear does n't last a day . My dog is 12 pounds and it is so incredibly easy to chew the limbs off these guys . My dog gnawed off the leg of one of the bears so we bought him a new one ( what were we thinking ? ) He gnawed off another leg . We duct taped it back on and he gnawed through the duct tape . Cute toy for small pups if they are n't big chewers but my dog is just determined to eat this thing .	-1
Okay KONG is known for creating some pretty tough , ready to take wear and tear items.This is not one of them.I was looking for a plush like toy my 20 lb dog could play with ... they say there 's not that much stuffing in it . KONG did not have to pick it up from all over the apt.Said brown bear was stripped and gutted in about an hour.Skip this one .	-1
My rottie/lab mix puppy , little girl 4 months old , had it in pieces the first night . The stuffing was the first to come out , so I cleaned out all that and let her have the squeaky part . Bad idea . She chewed it out and literally ate the pieces of plastic . If you have a mild chewer I think it would be ok , but it is not for heavy chewers .	-1
Ohhhhhhhhh ... the mess ! The stuffing was scattered in a matter of minutes . The flat bear was ripped apart and destroyed within a day . Disappointed .	-1
This toy is much too small to be safe for a dog , any size of dog . It is easily destroyed by a small dog and the very small pieces could be swallowed causing a very dangerous situation for your pet . Try the AKC brand of dog toys , they are well-made and much less risly for your beloved pet .	-1
I know this is NOT a chew toy , if your dog is not a chewer than it will be fine for you . My dog is a chewer and unfortunately this poor little teddy bear did not last long in our house ! The price was perfect so if your dog is not a chewer then I would recommend it because its really cute .	-1
Do not buy this toy if your dog has destroyed every other stuffed or cloth toy . Its the same ! Despite being solid under the Kong name , my 6 month old Yellow Lab ripped it to shreds in minutes . Are there any cloth toys out there for Labs ?	-1
Although this is really cute , it did n't last longer than a few hours . But that 's because my dog is very destructive .	-1
My dog really wanted to love this toy . I know , because he carried it around like it was his baby . But he could n't help himself , and within a day it was shredded . WestPaw are the only toys my dog can not destroy .	-1
I have a 25 pound mini goldendoodle . I thought no way does she tear through this & # 34 ; indestructible & # 34 ; teddy bear . Lasted all of 5 minutes and she had both ears off and the legs torn off ... What a joke . KONG should not be allowed to sell such garbage . I read the reviews and thought & # 34 ; well they must have a pitbull or a larger dog & # 34 ; ... NOPE , my 25 pound doodle ripped it in minutes . Stay away from this one and go with the fire house toys .	-1
Not work it it 's so tiny and shabby not worth the money at all I 'm not sure it would last now I have to take my little guy to get better one ) :	-1
These are cute toys but be aware : my chewing chihuahua did it in within one day . Cats could enjoy it .	-1
This is very cheaply made . 2 days of my 1.5 pound pomeranian puppy chewing on it and it fell apart . I did n't like the velcro under it for removing the squeaker , and it came with an extra squeaker too .	-1
It only took about 20 minutes before my 30lb puppy tore this little guy to shreds . We kept the & # 34 ; skin & # 34 ; around for a week or so before that too was destroyed . Come on Kong , you 're supposed to have tough and durable products . What gives ?	-1
This thing is so small it should be a cat toy , it 's the size of a catnip mouse 1/2 of the length is the tail . : (	-1
This toy is incredibly small . Will be returning because I 'm pretty sure my 14 pound mutt will swallow it whole .	-1
Okaye , this toy arrived in a little padded envelope . It was tiny . It does not look like the photo . It is about the size of a mouse , only it 's empty except for the squeaker . I put both squeakers in to make it fill out and squeak more easily ... . it 's tiny ! It is good for a small dog puppy , not a larger breed puppy , unless it wants to play with something the size of a mouse . My dog gets very excited about toys but this was quickly abandonned after a little over 5 minutes . She 's 13 lbs . I 'm not crazy about the velcro and how you can take the squeakers out , that 's something I believe some dogs can easily figure out .	-1
smaller than I thought it would be but true to Kong brand , it is well made and rugged for hours of play . This would be perfect for the toy breeds	-1
It lasted maybe 5 minutes before it hit the trash . Might be good for a small dog , but certainly not a Golden Retriver !	-1
Way too small for any dog that is bigger than the average cat . I gave it away to someone else since it was n't worth shipping back .	-1
It 's like a & # 34 ; nothing & # 34 ; for Jasper my 8 lb Yorkshire mix - he just ignores it . The brown tail of the Beaver looks like Jasper pooed on the floor if I do n't look closely . I would n't recommend it !	-1
So cheaply mad , tiny and paper thin . would probably last a day and my dogs DONT chew up their toys !	-1
This product 's page stated that the product included 4 replacement squeakers , but it only contained 1 . I actually ordered it for the 4 replacement squeakers so I could use them for other toys .	-1
nice size for small dogs but squeaker lasts for about five minutes . you have to keep replacing them . would n't buy again	-1
This looks more like a cat toy than a dog toy . I have a feeling my dachshund will destroy it in a matter of minutes .	-1
I found it way to small to give it to a small dog of any size of dog it would be more suitable for a cat then a dog I dident think it was that small to I really had seen it in person I couldent believe how small it really was in it that it would be more for a cat instead I think	-1
This toy , as described , is 7 inches from nose to end of tail . What I received was maybe an inch and a half . My dog would have choked on it .	-1
My 35 lb . springer spaniel mix is a brutally aggressive chewer . She slaughtered this lamb in ten minutes or so . I bought this toy based on the strong reviews as a last attempt to see if a soft toy could stand up to my dog . This toy faired no better than any other stuffed toys I have purchased .	-1
I bought this for my baby lab puppy and mercy , he only used it the first week we brought him home . It is super small and he quickly fished out the squeaky on the inside . I ended up giving this to a friend with a cairn terrier puppy - probably a much better fit ! This is smaller than the palm of my hand ! ! !	-1
Has n't worked at all . I have 3 cats , all are indoor animals . One got out and picked up fleas in the 3 hours he was out . It just has not worked .	-1
If you 're cat is an indoor cat , yes this product will work well for you . But if your cats go outside like mine , FORGET IT ! Yes Advantage kills fleas that are on your pet immediately . But it does not keep them flea free for 30 days , like they advertise . I 've tried Advantage on my cats a few times . The fleas that were on my cats did die within 12 hours . But within ONE WEEK they were biting and scratching again like before . I 'm picking fleas off of them after only a week and a half . If the product was n't so expensive , it might be worth the money . But do n't waste your money , because it only works well for a few days . Frontline works a lot better .	-1
I put this on my cat 4 times over a 4 month period . ( He is a healthy 3 year old ) Each time , he reacted more negatively than the time before . Last dose , he acted as if it was stinging him , and he was aggressive and in a bad mood for 2 days . I looked up information regarding counterfeit flea meds and although the vials do have the right wording -- the epa # on the vials is one of two epa # 's that have been counterfeited . I am not taking anymore chances with the last two vials . I am throwing it out . Guess I will have to buy from a more reputable source in order to feel safe about this .	-1
I ordered this advantage and was sent k9 advantix that my dog endedup having a bad reaction to . However the place I ordered from didrefund me the money for the product , so that was good .	-1
I actually would give this product a minus 10 . NEVER use these products on your pets . They are totally toxic - dogs have died from this - even with just 1 use . My friend 's Yorkie had a seizure within 40 minutes of this product being put on him . All of these topicals are poison . Search online for natural flea and pest control ; you 'll find lots of options . One thing we use is neem soap on our dogs ; it not only kills pests but it also repels them . You can also make a natural spray using 1 cup distilled water , several drops of an essential oil like cedar wood , citronella , lavendar , peppermint . You need to also add a tsp of castile soap so the essential oils will mix with the water . Spray on your hands and rub all over your dog 's coat before it goes outdoors in areas where there could be pests . Re-apply every 2 hrs . This is safe for pets and works ; nothing harmful . Do n't get the spray mixture in their eyes , nose and mouth . Vets say these are safe but that 's not true . The companies also only test these products for 30-90 days because they know that longer useage will show damage to the animal 's liver . Anything put on the skin is absorbed into the blood stream and then passes through the liver . NO to this junk ; it 's as bad as spraying your pet with Raid .	-1
After two applications I saw no improvement on my puppy . Then I found out online that it is ineffective if it 's applied within 48 hours before and after the bathing . Should n't this information be on the box if it 's so important ? I called the manufacturer and was `` serviced '' by very argumentative representative . I do n't think the product is worth the money at all . A friend of mine who used it also see no effect on her dog . You are better off buying from Hartz . At least their products are cheap and customer service is superb .	-1
I started giving Program tablets to my dog late summer / early fall last year . I had been using Capstar ( which works miraculously but is too expensive to use daily as a stand alone ) and read many reviews and articles stating how great Capstar and Program are when used together.My dog has allergies ( nasal and sometimes skin ) . Her hair started thinning out a little in the back and I just figured it had to do with her skin allergies . It very slowly kept getting worse . I have been trying over and over to figure out if there was something that could have been causing this , I realized it started after giving the Program tablets . I skpped the past month 's tablet and hopefully her hair will grow back in . Ca n't decide on a monthly to use on her , because Frontline Plus gives her hives on her belly . I will continue to use Capstar as needed ( a couple times a week or whenever she plays with the neighbor 's dog or grass is long/wet and itching starts ) .I 'm not saying it is a problem for all dogs , but it did cause the hair loss on my dog . This may not be a common side effect , but I ca n't recommend it to others because of this .	-1
I purchased this for my cats to try after a recent flea incident in the house . I tried to mix the suspension with their food ( I tried dry food and wet treats ) ... they sniffed it and walked away . I then followed the instructions and had to hold the cat and squirt the suspension into their mouth . It was messy , they hated it.. and I felt horrible trying to get them to take all of it . I 'm sticking with Frontline Plus ... much easier for my cats .	-1
I hated these bags ! Yeah I know , I stand alone in this . But I do hate them ! Wen I clean up dog poop , I also clean up any remnants of poop on the grass , sometimes pulling bits of grass out on purpose so as to leave nothing behind ( as best as I can ) . These bags make that impossible . There is no give in these bags for detailed work such as described . These bags are like doing surgery with hockey goalie gloves on . So I am back to standard bags which work great ( I prefer Bags on Board - come off roll clean , never fail/tear/etc. , can pick up more than one pile ( we 've smaller dogs ) , etc ... .	-1
We bought this to use in our backyard as it said it was a smaller version to throw the balls a shorter distance . They were n't kidding . We have a full-size chuckit and this junior version and this really does n't throw nearly as far . I 'd say the average adult could throw just as far as this , so we 've kind of rotated this out of usage and just use the full-size if going to a park and simply throw the ball by hand if we 're in the backyard . This was a waste of money as you can just use the full-size for shorter distances too and simply not throw the ball as far .	-1
I have arthritis so I thought this might help me throw the ball for our ball crazy lab . Do n't recommend this one period . its too long if you actually need a thrower and length made it awkward to handle and reload . If you have to use a thrower recommend shorter one . This says classic but it is longer than the ones I have seen at 3 pet stores .	-1
Awkward to use for petite women . It 's only good use is retrieving the ball from the ground even then most basic tennis balls have a hard time fitting in the grip . The balls normally get stuck inside the thing and I have to wiggle it out a little before slinging it . Once I sling it the ball does not really go that far and looks ridiculous . I would n't purchase another toy like this .	-1
so she will bring the ball back and drop the ball . then try to grab at the launcher as i try to pick up the ball with it.sometimes you have to really work to get this thing to release the ball . half the time when i swing it the ball stays in the cup.needs to have some sort of trigger you can use to open the cup when you swing it	-1
Our dog will fetch these , but if she catches a glimpse of one of the other types of chuckit balls- the rubbery ones- she will totally lose interest and only wants the rubbery one . Must feel better in her mouth . They also wont wear out like this one does- they only ever have to be replaced due to losing them . The tennis ball sheds its fibers and will wear out with time .	-1
I got these along with some other Chuckits for my dog , when they arrived I allowed her one of each type to play with . These were broken open and the outside material was all over the house within an hour . Granted she still wanted to play with them , but she was trying to eat the fuzz so I just pitched them . I will stick with Chuckits other toys because she still has all of those in one piece .	-1
My dogs ( lab & golden retriever ) destroyed these in a matter of minutes , then I had to take them away for fear of choking . DO NOT ORDER . All of the rubber chuckit ! balls are amazing and my dogs love them !	-1
Bought Chuckit ball and handle . I have Golden Retriever and after 10 days the ball cracked . It is a heavier ball for distance and thicker rubber ball under cover . It will split real easy after dog has it in mouth.I bought Kong Squeaker 3 inch ball works great ! Save your money !	-1
These are the tennis-type balls that come with the original Chuckit thrower . They 're OK , but they do n't go the distance or have the `` mouth appeal '' of the Ultra Chuckit ball . My yard is littered with these balls and none of my dogs will play with them , only the Ultra ball or various Planet Dog balls . Plus , according to The Whole Dog Journal , these colorful tennis balls are laden with chemicals that are n't healthy for your dog . Spend the money on Ultra ChuckIt balls ; They cost more but last longer , fly farther , and are easy to clean.This product has been rated by two young Labs ( brothers ) , a Golden Retriever and a Beagle .	-1
My dog loves fetch and I am a huge fan of the Chuckit ! launcher , however the tennis balls only seemed to last about a week tops . The felt disintegrates and then the rubber ball splits into two pieces . I thought this was just how life was going to be : forever buying these balls for our launcher . Then a friend told me that they just use regular tennis balls so I tried it . I bought a pack of 10 cheap-o tennis balls for the same price as I was paying for 2 Chuck it balls and three weeks later we 're still using on our first ball- amazing ! It fits perfectly in the launcher and still has felt and bounce . Thank you , Chuckit ! for making the medium sized launcher a standard tennis ball size . I will happily buy another launcher if my current one ever wears out , but I wo n't waste my money on these tennis balls .	-1
did not like them , hiding them all over the place , so not going to do this with the nutty dog . he did not like them	-1
Not worth the money . The individual dishes are very small . Maybe if you have a cat this would work well but defiantly not for dogs .	-1
I really wanted to like this feeder , but I do n't . The main problem is that you ca n't program it , you can only set it to go off EXACTLY 6/12/24 hours from the time you turn it on . So if you want to feed your cat at 6am , you better be around at 6pm or midnight to enable it . If you do n't use this every day and always have it turned on , this becomes a major hassle.The ice packs sort of work , but did n't keep the food particularly cold , freezing the food worked much better . They are very thin plastic that you fill with water , and I have a feeling the continual expanding of the ice will eventually break them.After a month I was so sick of trying to get this going at the correct times that I ditched it for the & # 34 ; PetSafe 5-Meal Electronic Pet Feeder & # 34 ; . It is much better.I will say though , if you make the necessary modifications ( see the pictures I added to the product ) , this feeder is impossible to break into . So if that is your primary concern , this is a good choice .	-1
This is a great product , or would be if it worked . The removable ice trays are a great feature to keep moist food fresh . There is a problem with the motor , probably a short , because it either runs all the time or not at all .	-1
I bought 2 of these for my cats , and they worked fine for a while . It 's a smart design , but they 've got many flaws.They use a LOT of batteries - the 9 volts die after 2-3 weeks ( so you have to keep a *close* eye on it ) , and they turn very slowly because of the weak , poorly designed motor . They both died within about 6 months , and I had to replace them.Also , it 's not really a 6-day unit - it 's a 6 *meal* unit . Each tray only holds up to 1/2 cup . Since my cats ( normal size ) eat 1/3 cup per meal , I must set the unit to go off twice a day . I ca n't imagine this working for a large dog . And , since the sixth compartment is perpetually open , you can only set it for 2 1/2 days in advance . Not much help for vacations.The person who said their unit has been working for 8 years is either mistaken or lying . This Asian company is barely 3 years old . I have a sneaking suspicion that the seller wrote a review of their own product , using their `` imagination '' & hyperbole.If anyone knows of a better system , please let us know or post a review .	-1
This product is OK if you 're only going away for a couple of days . I used it for about a week and now it is in he cupboard . I like the LeBistro Automatic feeder much better .	-1
I should 've known when I first tried putting in the battery ( when I tried to remove the battery , which is seriously difficult , it ripped off the metal contact point , wasting an expensive but otherwise new battery ) that this product was no good . I figured since Amazon 's return policy is a bit of a pain , I would stick with it and see . Well , about 8 months of using it , it started developing problems ; it would turn halfway , then backtrack , then turn to the intended slot . Now , 10 months in , it completely ping-pongs back and forth -- and it wo n't stop ; I have to turn it off midway and then turn it back on so it will turn to the correct food slot . I figured no problem , I 'm still under the 1-year warranty -- wrong ! I checked the manual and they only offer a 90-day warranty . What ? ! Had they offered a 1-year warranty AND I was out of that 1-year warranty , I would 've bought another one as a replacement . But the 90-day warranty is pretty worthless and shows they have no confidence behind their products . I 've already purchased the QPet Timed Automatic Pet Feeder ( hopefully I wo n't have the same issues ) .Other dislikes : horrible warranty , noisy motor , unable to set actual time ( only 6- , 12- or 24-hour time intervals from initially powering it on ) , uses expensive D battery ( thought the battery has lasted quite some time ) .	-1
I purchased the product even with all the negative reviews . First of all to refill the feeder requires really taking the feeder apart ... very cumbersome . However having said this the green light was on . I turned it on at the time I wanted it to rotate , 7 am every 24 hours . I had to wait until the next day , well it never rotated . Also the lid is very easy to move . I have a Bengal cat , even if the feeder had worked I know he would have easily been able to move it . I needed the feeder as we are going away . However I returned it . I will look for other options . Unfortunately there really are no other automatic feeders with any consistent good reviews . Save your time and effort , this product is not worth the trouble	-1
I do n't think these worked very well . It was hard to get my kitty to take them , even though I halved the tablet and hid it in a treat . Finally got her to eat a whole one , and w/in a couple of weeks , I noticed worms again . Took her to the vet who told me the OTC products do n't really work that well . I 'll take her to the vet again next time and not bother w/these or other OTCs .	-1
I used to only buy Science Diet . Knowing my elderly special needs cat did not like his dry food ; I decided to buy a bag of this . Big mistake.He did not like it and after a few days I noticed the cat food dispenser was very greasy ! I decided to give it to another house cat I have , same results , she did not like it.I am the caretaker of a feral cat colony . I have tried it on 7 feral cats and they are not even crazy about it . They eat it but not eagerly . I poured the bag in a food bin and every time I scoop it out , there is oil in the scooper and also on the plate . It is heavy with oils . It even smells disgusting.Sadly after trying this out on nine different cats , I have to say I would not buy this again . Try a sample locally or buy a smaller bag if you can . Not a hit here at all .	-1
I used this food with one cat for five years and figured she was just a puker . After she died , I got another cat at 4 years old and he began to vomit frequently . The lightbulb finally went off in my head- stopped the science diet and the vomiting stopped and has n't returned . Hmmmm.My carpets are happy too .	-1
Horrific cat food made with junk ingredients . If you care for your cat and want the best for them , take five minutes to research what you 're feeding them and I guarantee you , you will not be feeding them this food .	-1
Fits so tight you ca n't get it off . Not kidding . Get a Hill 's brand from your vet . They are free .	-1
I received my order today , and as other have mentioned , there is only one cap although the pictures show a package containing two . I re-read the information given and it does not make it clear that there is only one . At that number , the price is outrageous . Go to a pet store . They are much cheaper there .	-1
Love nylabones , but this just creates extra sharp edges everywhere . It means that our dog was unable to chew/gnaw without constant worry from us . We ended up tossing it for fears of teeth/gum injury . I 'll stick to regular shapes .	-1
My dog loved chewing on this dinosaur toy but after a couple of months he managed to finely shred it to the point that about 20 % of it was missing/ingested . It did n't seem to cause any digestive problems but was disconcerting nonetheless . We 've had better luck with another Nylabone product , theDouble Action Combo Bone Chew Toy , which is still going strong after 4+ years .	-1
The description says this is for & # 34 ; powerful chewers & # 34 ; but both of my dogs ( one is only 17 lbs ) destroyed theirs in short order . There were plastic shards everywhere and they were coughing them up too . Not safe for strong chewers !	-1
It 's durable because it is made of a solid very hard plastic material . My dog is a large dog , 85 lbs , and has only tried to chew on this once or twice since receiving it . She even cracked one of her canine teeth on it . I would n't recommend it . Mine has already found it 's way to the garbage can . Broken teeth ? No thanks !	-1
My dogs are 2 and 8 years old . They had no interest in these bones . Perhaps a puppy who has a strong urge to chew would like these . They have no smell and are a slick plastic texture .	-1
I got this toys along with a few others for my one year old Lab pup for Christmas . This is the only one he does not play with .	-1
This is a TERRIBLE dog toy . We received the Stegasaurus version of the toy . The & # 34 ; seams & # 34 ; from the plastic mold are incredibly hard and actually sharp . Unfortunately I gave this to the dog without first investigating it and he quickly began bleeding from cut gums . Even if you & # 34 ; shaved & # 34 ; those off , the Stegasaurus 's wide , awkward shape is bad for a medium or small dog at least . The hard bumps all over the outside seam weird . If they were softer , I could see how it would be a gum-massage but these are super hard .	-1
My Pit Brock chewed his head off in one hour ! if you have a pit do n't waste your $ $ $ not worth it	-1
My lab chews through every single toy except Kongs . He has already eaten the head off of this and I notice that little white plastic pieces come off . Not for my dog . I would suggest if you have a hard chewer to stick with Kong toys .	-1
Do not get this if you care about your dogs.I called Nylabone up to complain about this product.They said it is not for chewers.My dog is a golden retriever.Within 2 minutes of biting on it , it started to come apart .	-1
When I gave this to my dog he instantly went to town . As I sat and watched him I noticed the white t-rex had cut my dog 's mouth from the sharp edges . He is an aggressive chewer and did n't want to see it go , but it really required too much supervision than I felt comfortable with .	-1
& # 34 ; Chipped & # 34 ; away to easy ... ... ... I do n't like the idea of hard plastic pieces in my puppy 's tummy ... ..threw it away after a day & got a bigger heavier duty one ... ..he is a very powerful chewer ... ... ..	-1
Dogs do n't pay any attention to it . It just sits there . They love Kong toys though and have liked other Nylabone chew toys , just not this one . I do n't know why .	-1
This product was recommended by our Bulldog Rescue organization , but when we gave it to our English Bulldog , the little nubs came off in his mouth and his mouth was bloody . We threw it away . Perhaps this would work for smaller or gentle chewers .	-1
This is very hard ! My pup does n't want to even lick this thing . Once I took it out the package I knew he was n't going to like it . Guess I 've should of payed attention to all the bad reviews .	-1
Do not buy this so called & # 34 ; chew & # 34 ; toy ! There is no way a dog could safely chew on this VERY tough and HARD thing ! As soon as we handled it , banged it on the counter , and saw how DENSELY it 's made , it got the deep six . Looks dangerous IS DANGEROUS - protect your dog - do n't have this in the house !	-1
After reading the negative reviews about broken teeth and other issues , I 'm kind of relieved that none of my dogs have shown any interest in this chew . I even tried coating it with yummy stuff ( peanut butter , etc . ) to get my dogs to take interest , but they 'll only lick the coating off and then leave the chew . My dogs are all mixes of German Shepherd , Rottweiler , Pit Bull , and Border Collie , so it should say something that they will have nothing to do with this item . I 'm tired of stubbing my toe on it after having it around the house unused for over a year . It 's going in the trash .	-1
Stick with the bone shaped . The little details bits can get chewed off the stegosaurus . I 've liked that the nylabone bones because it typically only get little bits scraped off but The heads tail and feet all can break off . I 'd still say its safer then most toys out there but chewers need to beware	-1
It did however get sharp after the dogs played with it for a couple of weeks ... .finally had to throw it out cause I was worried it might hurt the dogs gums , or someone would step on it and slice their foot open	-1
I ordered this for my 15-lb Jack Russell . We got the stegosaurus toy and so far , it 's held up . She 's a ferocious chewer -- we ca n't buy her anything but Nylabone-type toys or they immediately get torn to bits . The only problem I foresee is that the stegosaurus has four legs sticking off of the body , and I know those are going to get worn down very quickly as she can fit that whole part in her mouth at once , meaning she ca n't play with this unless we 're there to see her least she chew off a leg and choke on it . It would 've been nice to be able to have seen this variety and choose which one we wanted prior to ordering . I was thinking we would get the T-Rex pictured , which only has two feet that seem to be attached to the tail . The good news is , steggie does n't have a small projectile head or tail , but rather it curves to give the impression of head and tail , so no worries about small pieces coming off there . The toy itself I would probably give 3.5 or 4 stars , but I am only giving it an overall 3 because the ordering process is inflexible.UPDATE : I have lowered my rating to 2 stars . She has had this less than 5 months and I had to take it away from her after she managed to chew away the legs , tail , head , and half the body . I do n't mind if she ingests tiny shreds of a Nylabone on occasion , but I ca n't imagine eating 4 ounces of plastic is doing anyone 's digestive tract any favors .	-1
My dog loved the dinasaur chew toy THAT IS SHOWN IN THE ADVERTISEMENT . Unfortunately that is not the chew toy that was received . The substitution was white and I believe was a taradactal . It is all angular and sharp points . My dog would n't even touch it . She even know the difference.This looks like a cheap substitution and I am upset that you just assume that we would n't know the difference . I left all of them at the dog park in case some other dog would want them . From now on DO NOT SUBSTITUTE without advising in advance . Very upset with this kind of business practice . All nylabone products ARE NOT equal .	-1
bear pays no attention to it . But time may change that . It stays among his toys . He has not found a way to brake it which is a plus for him .	-1
I 've got the T-Rex one . It does n't feel like rubber , it feels like hard plastic ! It 's also pretty sharp around the edges . I 'm surprised at the number of 5 star reviews . Maybe it 's just me but I 'm not giving it to me puppy 'cause I 'm afraid it might hurt his gums .	-1
I have a 3 year old english/american bulldog mix that loves chewing on nylabones/dingos . I bought this product selfishly , because I like dinosaurs . Unfortunately , the littel nubs tore into her gums like nobody 's business and left sharp shards sticking out . She only had it for a short time under ( sort of laxed ) supervison , but when i looked down the thing 's entire tail was covered in blood . Into the trash it went . Moving forward , I will stick to the non-nubby nylabones .	-1
I am a dog trainer , for 30 years , this should have been pulled years ago . the parts break off and get wrapped in the dogs guts , kills them , or huge vet bill for surgery . recently one of my sheltie clients did not heed me , lovely dog , huge huge vet bill.DO NOT BUY AT ALL ! ! ! ! ! DOG TRAINER WARNING ! ! ! !	-1
My teething puppy ( chocolate bullador ) preferred this toy to nylabone 's teething toys and has no interest with his permanent teeth . He has the same reaction to the bacon-flavored hollow stick.Before buying , know your dog 's chewing style ; not just based on breeds , but your actual pet . I have done a fair amount of research online , reading reviews , and talking to pet store clerks to find out this is not an uncommon behavior . Teething puppies are figuring out the world and will put anything in their mouth but may prefer a hard surface to push their teeth against into their gums . Then , with adult teeth , they may want to use their powerful teeth to destroy . So , this toy will likely fail to redirect destructive behavior because they will not be able to cause any damage . My dog quickly lost interest and started gnawing on his previously ignored teething bone , which I had to quickly take away after two days . He got one good day out of the teething bone , exposing the dental bristles , but was breaking off much larger pieces on day two and would have destroyed the whole thing in under and hour if I had not separated him from it . Now , I am stuck with two durachews and not quite sure how to spark his interest in either.Pro : Teething puppy looking for hard surfaceCon : Useless for powerful chewer that can not dent	-1
This product was a lot harder than I thought it would be when purchased . It 's the toughest plastic , with hard raised bumps.My puppy is a very heavy chewer ( destroyer ) , and seemed to really like this chew , but I took it away from her . It made terrible cracking noises , and I was afraid she was going to break her teeth .	-1
I bought this for my 10lb mini doxie and she has little to no interest in it . It 's super rock hard ! I may try to put some peanut butter on it to make it more appealing but probably will give it to my parents ' golden retrievers to see if it interests them . Also , I was unable to choose which dinosaur shape I wanted at checkout . Kind of inconsequential but I really wanted the Tyrannosaurus Rex ! Instead I got the Stegosaurus . Perhaps that 's why she does n't like it : )	-1
I was so excited just before Christmas to find these at such a reasonable price since they Nylabone - our dogs are generally crazy about them - but these two have gone virtually untouched . I think are they are a little harder and the spikes are pretty 'rough ' ... we have two dogs - large and medium and neither one are too taken with them . We will most likely offer them to the dogs next door to try ... .	-1
Purchased this for my dog who almost choked on it . Vet later warned me that these `` chew toys '' are hazardous to dogs . I tossed it . Waste of money .	-1
We purchased the Stegosaurus at a local pet store the day we adopted our cattle dog mix . At the time she was about 45 pounds and 8 months old . We did not know what kind of chewer she was , but felt that a product designed for `` powerful '' chewers up to 50 pounds would be a safe choice . It was not . She worked to remove the head and tail of the dino and while we were able to get the larger pieces from her , she swallowed several very small pieces . And much to our embarrassment , at her first vet visit ( 3 days after adoption ) we were told to stop giving her whatever `` white plastic '' toy she was chewing and eating . Enough pieces had gotten into and through her system to cause the vet concern she may not pass all of them.I am giving this product 1 star because:1 ) It is described as a product for powerful chewers - it did not hold up2 ) It is rated for dogs up to 50 pounds - while on the upper end of the scale , our dog fits into that category and the product did not hold up3 ) the vet warned us to stop using the product as the size and shape of the pieces were potentially harmful to our dog .	-1
So far my puppies will play with or chew on anything BUT this . I do like nylabone brand but this is n't the best so far ... .	-1
My dogs usually love nylabones dental chewy stuff but not this one . It is very hard plastic and some dogs like that but not mine . Not worth trying as an experiment .	-1
Careful people ! Even though this chew toy says for powerful chewers , it also says for dogs up to 50 lbs in VERY tiny print on the bottom of the package . I gave it to my 79 lb Lab Mix puppy anyway , since I had already bought it ... and lo and behold , it began falling apart in only a few moments.After removing the toy and picking up the white bits all over ... I thought to come here and warn people . I find it odd how it 's for powerful chewers yet only includes medium sized dogs in the toy description ! With pit bull terriers and a few other smaller breeds as an exception ... usually smaller dog means less destructive chewing ability . Senseless , really.If you have a dog that falls under this weight category ... except for a breed with very powerful jaws , this toy probably suits just fine , but if you have a large dog , do n't even think about it . I paid almost $ 9 for a toy that begun to disintegrate within a few seconds .	-1
I bought this quite a while back . At first my dog did n't take to it , but it 's now one of her old go-to toys . Why 2 stars ? This thing gives my dog an unfair advantage in the house . If we 're playing 'chase ' , this is the only toy I can never get away from her because it hurts my hands to hold on to . She also leaves it in strategic locations as to cause the bare foot the most damage . Overall , it 's a good toy for a dog and not a person .	-1
This looks like a figurine in actual . It 's pretty heavy for my 5 month old puppy . I felt like she is lifting a rock and I was concern that her jaw might hurt .	-1
The dog chewed it once and will not go near it now . I am not certain if it is the item , the hardness or what , but the dog does not like it .	-1
So while I was getting ready for my new corgi puppy I purchased this from Amazon . I thought , `` Hey -- good for strong chewers and he 'll be teething ! Perfect ! '' Add to that the fact that I love dinosaurs and this was a must.At a checkup for my cats before the dog came home I talked to my vet about some of the concerns with the new puppy , and her recommendations for good chew toys . She warned us against the white Nylabone toys specifically . She did n't want our dog to have anything harder than a tooth to chew on ( including bones and hard plastic toys like this ) because of the potential to crack his teeth . Even though he 's a puppy , she was concerned about the possibility of infection and abscess in a cracked tooth and the dangers of putting a puppy under for oral surgery to extract the cracked tooth/teeth . I 'm glad she did warn me because I never would have known.As soon as we got back from the appointment I returned it and Amazon gave me a refund no problem ( five stars for the customer service there ) , so that was good . In retrospect , I can see she was right . If nothing else I could have kept the toy to beat up any intruders in my apartment -- it really is that hard .	-1
My vizsla puppy loved this toy and started to chew it right away . In 5 minutes there were a lot of small and very sharp pieces everywhere . I had to throw the toy out . My puppy destroys everything and chews on toys really hard so this chew toy was n't the right choice for him . But it would probably work with dogs who are easy chewers .	-1
My 6 month old , 45 lb puppy is a super aggressive chewer and likes Nylabone products . She was really interested in this one , HOWEVER , the plastic is not durable and basically becomes a sharp , flaking mess ! This chew piece ( & # 34 ; for powerful chewers up to 50 lbs & # 34 ; ) is NOT good . It made my dogs gums & lips irritated and now she has a big , pink , patchy sore on her lip - which looks like a rug burn - from her lip rubbing up on the distorted , sharp plastic of this T-REX . We were so excited to get a new chew , but it 's awful ! I took it away and her lip & gums are healing . I suggest Nylabone take this product OFF the Market . We 're sticking to Elk & Deer Antlers , hooves & other natural chews from now on ! THUMBS DOWN , NYLABONE . = (	-1
This is suppose to be one of there tuffest bones . Our dog had it 5 minutes and she had it broken apart into tiny sharp shards . 24 hours later we had to rush her to the emergency vet only to find out part of this toy was blocking here intestine . Stay away form this toy , or you may have a huge vet bill like we did , $ 3000 to remove a chunk the size of your pinky .	-1
but it makes me nervous . These are extremely hard . I got one for the little power-chewer ( 16 pound standard dachshund ) and he likes the little bumps and the stego shape even though it 's a little big for him ... Little Remy has great teeth and a strong jaw , and does well with toys and treats made for dogs that are a bit bigger than him ( for reference , he chewed through a giant rawhide bone that was longer than he is which I only gave to him for a Christmas laugh ) . But I will probably take it away from him . It 's too hard and has no give ; it actually feels like solid plastic . I dislike Nylabone 's sizing because saying & # 34 ; up to xxlbs & # 34 ; seems misleading . This toy does not look or feel safe for the teeth of dogs & # 34 ; up to 35 pounds. & # 34 ; Personally , I would even hesitate to give it to a larger dog like my sadly departed black lab , who never had a bad tooth in her 13 years.If your dog has any dental problems , avoid this toy . Weak teeth might not be able to hold up against it . But the dino shape and bumpy texture are very interesting to dogs , so I wish that there were softer version of this toy.Also watch out because these are about as fun to accidentally step on as Legos .	-1
I have three dogs . Two cocker spaniels and a jack russell terrier . None of them like this toy . They have had several Nylabone toys , but this one is the least favorite . Each of them tried it out , but they all got bored with it fast . It is very heavy and the points are somewhat sharp . That may not be what turns my dogs off though because they have had other textured toys . After handling it myself , I would be worried about it being to coarse and causing bleeding gums or injuring their teeth .	-1
Did n't interest my dog at all . He would rather chew up the plastic down spout . At least he did ruin it and swallow big pieces .	-1
My three dogs found nothing interesting with this toy . I do n't even they smelled eat . It is worthless . Do not buy	-1
My dog ignored it . Had to throw it away . What else can I say about something that my dogs do n't like ?	-1
Our dog was moving from moderate to heavy chewing around the time we got this , darn thing lasted all of 2 hours as our lab pup ripped into the head and tail of the stegosaurus that showed up in the package . It says this can stand up to hardy chewers so not sure if we received the incorrect dinosaur or whether there is no truth in this advertising . I do n't recommend this product if you pup is anything close to a remote chewer and/or over 45 lbs . I did n't bother returning it or making a big deal since other Nylabone products have worked out well for us so this one probably just needs to be calibrated lower in terms of durability and rated for less than moderate chewers . The entire dinosaur is too small as well and I was worried he would actually swallow the darn thing	-1
I 'm disappointed to say that there are very few bubbles , mostly very tiny and they pop as soon as they touch something . I gave it a thorough test , blowing air at different speeds and angles , shaking the bottle before using and then using it when it has n't been shaken in a couple of days , etc . Total letdown.Important to note : both I and another person who gave this a shot felt stinging in our eyes when the bubbles popped close to our faces . Not good ! ! !	-1
Cat loves ( regular ) bubbles ! Bought this stuff . Now , the cat just waits for the bubbles to pop after they land on the floor , and she licks that up.Can you say 'Lack of motivation ... dude. & # 34 ; ? *Sigh*Maybe my cat should watch Cheech & Chong movies ... : -\	-1
I thougth this was worth a try . A new treat for my 2 kitties . Unfortunately , they each just watched the bubbles fall to the floor and pop . One of them did sniff the spot where the bubbles broke , but that was about it . Nice idea , but no treat for my 2 kitties anyway .	-1
This stains my carpet green and it 's a hit or miss on the bubbles . Plus , you have to pour it out to get the plastic bubble blower out .	-1
Does n't work well .	-1
My cat has n't tried it yet but I tried to make bubbles and there are n't any coming . It 's going to be very disappointing when I come home later	-1
My cat will sit and watch the bubbles , maybe even approach a group of them while they are falling , but he wo n't pop them . Sometimes he even acts scared of them , which I personally think is bologna . For the price , you can find a cooler toy for your kitty .	-1
After reading all the reviews I thought I 'd go ahead and try it since I started to make Max 's food and treats . He would n't have anything to do with it . Tried making gravy with it or sprinkling it or mixing it with a little bit of food and covering it up with the rest of the food . He would eat around it . So even though it might be great Max wo n't touch it . Will keep on trying until I find something he 'll like .	-1
I had my dog on this for a couple months and noticed a wonderful bloom in his coat but also noticed his ears began to be unusually smelly . I feed my dog raw so he does n't get grains anywhere . I checked the product closely and noticed the ingredients label listed flax seed . Took him off Nupro and his ears cleared up . We now stay away from anything with flax . After adding raw green tripe to his diet , I am noticing similar positives . It is a shame , Nupro is otherwise a great product . I would recommend it to others whose dogs are more tolerant of flax .	-1
No matter how good the nutritional value is , or how good it smells , it 's no good if the dog wo n't eat it , and mine wo n't . I am SO disappointed . I tried mixing it in warm water to make a gravy . Smelled great . He hated it . I then tried heating the & # 34 ; gravy & # 34 ; to really mix the powder into the HOT water . I let it cool . Put it on his food . Hated it . Next I tried it dry , just sprinkled on top . He hated that , too . The good news is that my brother 's Rottweiler loves it . But he loves anything ! I wanted this supplement because I am concerned about my fussy eater . Unfortunately , it did n't help ME , at all .	-1
I have been using the Missing link skin & coat for my bulldog . She was diagnosed with a nutrition deficiency even after eating $ 50 a bag dog food for years . The missing link helped but it was expensive . So when I saw this 5lb tub I jumped on it . Here is the issue , the dose of the Nutri-pet is 2 scoops a day . The missing link is 1/4 of a scoop a day . This 5lb tub did not last very long.I do n't know if it really helped my dog . Her skin conditions still seems to come back every few months . This was only a 1 month supply for my 50lb dog . So once the tub was empty I went back to Missing Link , the 5lb bag is a little more expensive but lasts 6 months or more .	-1
I have tried everything from small doses to using other foods to camouflage the Nupro . Nothing works . My GSD refuses to eat this product . My GSD will devour his food otherwise . He will also eat his food with liberal amount of salmon oil on it . He simply will not eat his food with Nupro . If anyone has a suggestion , please advise . I plan to try another supplement .	-1
I used this successfully years ago with an Akita and several Labs . I do n't know if the formula has changed but it 's labeled & # 34 ; original & # 34 ; , so probably not.I now have mother/son mutts with somewhat sensitive stomachs . They both got sick the second day ... I was easing into it and had n't even gotten to the 1/2-recommended-dose point .	-1
Our Koi do well on this food , so I ordered several 5 pound bags to get us through the summer . However , the actual bags have changed from last year . Whereas before they were easy to zip open and closed , and had a handle built in , now they do not have either of those features . In fact , the bag is practically impossible to seal between feedings . And it is very bulky and awkward to carry out to the pond now that there is no handle built in to the bag . I do n't understand why the company would change these two features , it does n't make any sense . I am going to have to find a suitable container now , to pour 5 pounds of fish food in to , that will have a handle and that I can close properly in between Koi feedings . Very disappointed .	-1
Received box with fish food and lounger that I ordered . Unknown to me the fish food broke open and was loose inside the box ... that was n't the worse part-fine dust from the fish food leaked out of the box and was all over the lounger box as well as my kitchen counter and floor . The size of fish food was priced well compared to that available in this area , however , I do n't think the clean up made it worth it .	-1
I thought a Souper would be a good size for my power chewer , but there is nothing appealing about this bone to him , and it is so heavy and smooth he can barely carry it in his mouth for a minute before dropping it .	-1
This is not a good one for puppies that are chewers . We have two pups , one is 25 lbs and the other is 60-ish . After the first day they had chewed lines into it . I recommend the Nylabone Big Chews for Big Dogs , Knot . We 've had that for 6 months now and it 's taking quite the beating but still holding up better than this Galileo bone .	-1
This was n't cheap yet IMO I think that it 's a cheap product . It 's been sitting around my dog area since I bought it and months later it barely shows any signs of dog teeth involvement . I would n't recommend it .	-1
Although I think the Nylabones are good if not the best bones to get for overactive chewers , I have not purchased this particular and peculiar , uh , 'bone ' as I ca n't fathom a dog chewing on a 'toy ' that resembles a penis . Besides , what will visitors think when there 's a chewed up looking plastic , penis-resembling 'toy ' laying on the floor ? So . I ask the company , why ? ? I think I will stick to the 'bone ' shaped chews , my favorite being the giant dura-chews , which stand up to their name and last a really long time ! And my dog ( Terrier-Sheepdog mix ) is a power-chewer and may have a compulsive chewing disorder being a year and a half old ! : )	-1
I usually have only great things to say about most Nylabone chews , however , the shape/style of this one I do not like . It also seems to splinter more quickly than the other products . One bone will typically last my pooch 2-4 weeks , this one I had to throw out after just one week . I will not purchase this product again .	-1
I purchased this product for my new 1-year old Lab puppy , a real chewer . My veterinarian advised me that they repeatedly see dogs with broken teeth from Nylabone products , because they are too hard for canine tooth enamel .	-1
I bought this excitedly thinking that we would have another option for our heavy chewer ( lab/shepherd mix ) to go along with the Nylabone Big Chews we buy . Our dog had inch-long gouges in this bone within 10 minutes , and was pulling off pieces larger than grains of rice in 15 . This was not a good fit for our dog , and I 'd highly recommend keeping a close eye to make sure they 're not getting big pieces off when you first give it to your dog . You just never know . We still buy the Big Chews religiously .	-1
Always loved Nylabone products . My dog dropped this on the floor the first day he got it an the bone cracked.Nylabone is not cheap and the company needs to improve its product quality or you will end up losing longtime loyal customers like myself .	-1
I guess I 'm in the minority . I had heard that these were a problem and shrugged off the warning as one from the few malcontents having a bad day and bought this . Good chewing BUT ... ..they made my dog sick and he barfed five times . And guess what came up ? And , yes , the sharp little edges were still there . No more nylabone products for me . I feel so strongly about the danger of these products that I am making the effort to go to every nylabone product on Amazon to post this warning . mb	-1
Bought this for my 2-year-old lab as she is a chewer . She sniffed it and walked away . I left it in her toy box and she picked it up once but only to move it out of the way to get at something else . I do n't think it has a smell that entices dogs to chew it as my 9-month-old , also a big chewer , has n't touched it either . I 'm sure there are other dogs who love this but it was a waste of money for me .	-1
This is really no different than any other Nylabone other than the shape . The bone is still a hard plastic type material that does splinter and form sharp shards that cut the dogs mouth and catch on everything . Not really happy , was hoping for a different material that does n't do that . So it is over rated and not what I had hoped for .	-1
We have an avid chewer ( lab/boxer ) and bought this thinking it might be a toy that actually lasts . Well it has but only because our dog wo n't chew it . I was very surprised at how hard it was and was worried about our dog 's teeth . He was interested when we first gave it to him but now never touches it . I think it 's partially because of the heavy weight of it also . We 've had better luck so far with the KONG Extreme Goodie Bone . Our dog will chew this ( we do n't put treats in it , although you can ) . I think he likes it because it 's a softer material that he can sink his teeth into a bit . So far it has lasted .	-1
I think there is something wrong with this food . We received the case today and gave it to our cats and they began vomiting shortly after . We have fed them the chicken flavor for several months with no problem , but this was the first time our cats became ill .	-1
My dog is slowly , but surely , chewing the ends of this toy off , and without much effort because he does n't like this toy very much to begin with . This is not made out of the same material as a traditional Kong toy .	-1
It was too large for my dogs and the openings at each end are too big to stuff with treats - can only use treats like peanut butter and or cream cheese .	-1
We have had a regular , large size red Kong for months . It 's still going strong . We put a medium size Milk Bone in it and he loves it.He 's now fully grown at 70 lbs and I figured I 'd upgrade to a bigger size and get some teeth cleaning done at the same time.NOT an upgrade ! Short version . I put a large Milk Bone in it . I 'm in the room with him and I look over and see him with his head up proudly looking at me chewing , but the Kong is on the floor . I figure he got the bone out of it already , but there is no crunching . Turns out he 's eating a piece of the Kong and there are other pieces missing that he must have already swallowed . I do n't know how dangerous that could be but it seems pretty bad . What if I had left him alone with it.The story ends ... ... Ten minutes from Amazon package to garbage can .	-1
Dog destroyed this in seconds ... I think I will stick to the Extreme Kongs ! Too bad they do n't make an extreme version for this toy , I would have liked to try it ! ! It was lame of me to try it , I should have expected this , tbh .	-1
My lab chewed right through it . it is too soft and some big dogs will destroy this in 2 minutes .	-1
Although it clumps well , my cat objected to the smell . I introduced it gradually , but once litter was pure world 's best , kitty pooped on the floor instead of in the litter . Switched back to clay and she was fine again .	-1
I tried this product after using Arm & Hammer , Tidy Cats , and at least one other brand . My cat is not picky about his food or litter and has never missed his litter box . I slowly integrated this litter with Arm & Hammer Litter and it was n't until it was nearly completely World 's Best Cat Litter that he decided to take a dump less than two inches away from his designated area.This has never happened before but luckily that was the only incident . Looking over it , I still ca n't find many reasons to continue purchasing this brand . It tracks EVERYWHERE . I have a black table nearby my cat 's litter box and it looks like someone dropped corn flour every time my cat exits his designated area . The odor control is mediocre at best.I do not recommend this litter nor will I be repurchasing this brand .	-1
So last night I experienced a litter emergency ( emptied out the box only to realize I barely had any left to refill ) and the only store still open was Target . So I wanted to switch from Tidy Cats which I found to be too dusty and has this weird deoderizer smell which progressively becomes less pleasant the longer it stays out . Having a limited variety to choose from , I picked up World 's Best . BIG mistake . Honestly , it 's not as though I was expecting this to be the best , but ironically it 's probably among the worst . I understand all the hype about all natural products , but using corn as litter is probably the dumbest idea . When I opened the bag , I did n't expect that it it would smell exactly like grain . I wondered how something that smelled like that could possibly neutralize urine and feces odors , but since this product is priced higher than the rest and is obviously selling , I decided to ignore my skepticism . It has not even been 24 hours since I purchased this and I am absolutely outraged that this company has the nerve to sell an 8 lb bag for close to $ 10 and claim to be the world 's best litter , when their product is complete trash.Here 's everything that is wrong with this litter : -It smells like grain out of the bag and just smelled like grain mixed with feces and urine after my cat used it . I do n't know how this has any positive reviews , but I noticed that some positive ones express that those who have issues with it probably have cats with very stinky excrement . Well , my cat is a tiny kitten whose poop is NOT overly stinky because she is fed the best quality food I can find . I just dumped all the litter into the trash , because seeing how it smells , I know my cat will stop using the box if it stays in there any longer . Cats are like that.-Many people expressed that this litter breaks down into a fine powder after some time . I already noticed that powder forming along the bottom of the box . This means DUST , which I 'm guessing is the reason she had stopped burying her waste with the Tidy Cats . Plus she was sneezing all the time . That being said , in terms of odor , Tidy Cats is still a far better product and less expensive than this one.-This is perhaps the WORST part : When I placed my cat into the litter box after adding this litter to introduce her to it , she sniffed for a couple of minutes and I was horrified when she ATE a few grains . She was confused and thought it was FOOD ! I can imagine how ludicrous it must have seemed to her to have to poop and pee in food . After I read another review about someone else 's cat eating it , I gave up on the idea of using it up by mixing it with the new litter I bought ( Precious Cat which sells a much higher rated 18 lb bag for almost the same price this one sells an 8 lb bag for ) .That being said , if I ca n't stand the smell of this litter , I 'm fairly certain my cat ca n't . The main reason cats stop using their litter boxes is because of odor issues . I pay extra for odor control and if , after cleaning the box twice a day as I usually do , I still have to deal with odor issues , then this stuff is clearly a huge waste of money . So far I ca n't say much about the Precious Cat , which I immediately went out and purchased to replace this one , other than the fact that when I opened the bag , I did n't smell any funny odor or experience a puff of dust , and when I put my cat into the box she sniffed a bit and walked out as though there was nothing unusual worth investigating . If you can get to a Pet Supplies Plus or Petco , I 'd probably buy that one as it 's only a bit more expensive than Tidy Cats and probably WAY better ( I 'll soon find out ) . But the bottom line is , I would use ANY litter over this one .	-1
It clumps and that is about all it does in which I do like but I do n't like the fact that I can be in my kitchen and once he is done using the litter box I can smell the litter when he scoops it over his crap . The litter does not hold up to odor control at all and it 's dusty in between cleaning and I have asthma so this does n't work good for me . I will not purchase this again .	-1
Luckily we got this free as a promotion because my cats would not use it . The one cried and cried and held it in until we got some tidy cats the next day . It looks like nice litter but I guess it 's either the smell or the feel that they do n't like . I am so glad it was free because I think it was a 9.00 bag and I would have been upset had I paid for it since I had to throw it out almost unused .	-1
Ordered directly from PetFoodDirect before I saw the negative reviews here . So after delivery , I decided I would make the transition slowly . A week and a half later , I was feeding approx half old and half new , and one of the dogs started vomiting/had diarrhea , had no appetite , and was lethargic . I 'm switching him to a plain chicken and rice diet , but if he does n't get better soon , I 'll have to take him to the vet.Other dog must have an iron constitution because she seems fine.UPDATE : Took the sick dog to the vet . He was given IV fluids because he became dehydrated . $ 150 and one day later , he seems a little better . But vet said the blood work came back a little off and I should bring him back for x-ray and recheck . I 'm going to hold off because I do think he 's improving on the bland diet.The other dog had some alarming sounds coming from her stomach last night . She seems fine today , but I think if the first dog had not become sick and if I had kept giving Canidae , I think this dog would have eventually become sick as well .	-1
WARNING ! ! ! ! ! they do n't even make there own food it is licensed out to another company if you look on the back of the bag it does n't even list who it is made by it only says guaranteed by canidae and when i asked who it was made by i was1 either completely ignored2 given a huge run around only thing i ever got was a state it was made in they would n't even tell me the companythis is dangerous because this is how all the pet food recalls happened a few years ago by out sourcing manufacturing	-1
My husband and I switched our three dogs to Canidae earlier this year based on the many glowing recommendations that I found on the Internet . Our dogs have done very well on it until recently ( we always bought the 40 pound bags for our three LARGE dogs but now it 's in the 35 pound bags ) when they all became ill with diarrhea . My oldest dog has had diarrhea and horrible hot spots all over his buttocks with the fur falling out and flaky dry skin for the last few weeks . After one of my dogs was sick all over the house today , my husband mentioned that he was beginning to suspect it was the Canidae -- he suspected that Canidae may have changed their formula , so I checked the Internet to see if anyone else was complaining and there are complaints all over the Internet ! Apparently Canidae changed their formula without warning and many dogs who have tolerated it well in the past are suddenly becoming violently ill. My husband is picking up a bag of another brand tonight , that we have used with no problems in the past , so that we do n't have to feed them any more of the Canidae . Most dog owners know NOT to change their pets food suddenly as it can cause them to become ill , but apparently Canidae did it without warning anyone or allowing them the opportunity to gradually switch their dogs over to the new formula . Apparently Canidae is blaming 'net hysteria as the reason why people are blaming their food for these dog illnesses -- but our dogs have been sick for several weeks now , way BEFORE we even suspected it was the Canidae .	-1
I have a new Akita puppy , and bought the Canidae ALS for him since I could n't get the breeders type of food in my area . After transitioning him to the Canidae , his stools were loose and yellow . I looked on-line , and saw that Canidae switched their formula , and my puppy 's symptoms were mild compared to some I read about . I immediately switched my puppy to Wellness Puppy , and everything has been coming out fine since .	-1
This product is really small flakes of cedar sawdust which to my cats is the 'after product ' of their normal little feline pine . So to them even fresh litter was 'used ' and this led to an unexpected cat dump in the shower . There was also a lot of tracking of this sawdust all over the house . I am going back to Feline Pine .	-1
I bought this toy for my 8 month old Mini Schnauzer ( around 12 lbs ) . Although he enjoyed playing with it , after about a month the blue dots started to fall off and he began swallowing them . Not sure how safe it is to swallow peaces of blue plastic , but I took the toy away .	-1
This said it was for a medium chewer . I realize now that my puppy has a strong bite but she had both ends of this bone off and in little pieces within 10 minutes . I would not recommend it .	-1
My dog was so very sick and as I was about to take him to the ER , he vomited several pieces of this chew bone . I will add a photo . This could have been a disaster requiring surgery , or causing death . PLEASE , do n't buy this . My dog loved it but I should have listened to the other negative reviews . Please do n't learn the hard way like I did . He 's only 13 lbs.PS I have since learned that rawhide treats are no good either , the rawhide sits in their stomach taking weeks to digest . The butcher dept in my grocery store sells bone marrow bones . I think it 's the cow 's femur . I boil it for 15 mins and dogs love it It will keep him busy for hours.Update : I 've since learned from comments below that dogs have broken their teeth on these bone marrow bones . Luckily my dog seems to be over the chewing phase .	-1
Turned around and my 40 pound dog had it in pieces in no time . He 's pooping blue smurfs now . He 's proud .	-1
our dog does n't want anything to do with this . he is a little pup so maybe he will grow into it .	-1
Our 5 month old chihuahua pup loves his chew toys and so we monitor him while he chews . He does n't have a lot of teeth yet but he managed to break off a small nub within a 5 minute period . I decided to take it away from him for fear that he would chew off more nubs . I 'm sure ingesting small amounts may not be too harmful , but I would n't want my puppy to end up ingesting alot of it . I would not recommend .	-1
Toxic , not to be eaten by your dog , but they are too be dental chews ? Not even worth the money !	-1
My dog literally sat down with it , and about 1 minute later , he 'd chewed small pieces off the side of it and was eating them off the floor . Literally stunned my parents and I . Had to give him a treat while someone else got the bone away from him . Unreal.A minute . My dog is 20 pounds . Not some huge breed of monster .	-1
Did n't last five minutes . Pretty sad . Was hoping for at least 20 minutes of chew time out of it . Oh well .	-1
I have a 9 month old puppy . She destroyed this in minutes . Would not recommend for heavy chewers . Better options out there .	-1
It breaks apart into smaller sharp pieces which I then step on in the living room without shoes on . Much like a Lego in the dark . Sad .	-1
My puppy who is a Catahoula Leopard was about 13 weeks when I bought this . She did n't take to this toy right away , would rather chew on the other smooth dog bones . Makes me think she did n't like the feel of it . Plus it 's quite heavy which I found she does n't like the heavy chew toys . She only chewed on it a short few times and that was it . I definitely would not recommend this .	-1
My little boxer chewed this down to a third of the size in about an hour . After ingesting a good amount she got sick the following morning and some of it was in her vomit .	-1
But within in minutes my 30 lb pup was throwing up the small pieces which were easily chewed off of this product.I threw it away within minutes of giving it to her ... ..not for us .	-1
Within 15 minutes it was chewed to pieces . DO NOT purchase this item . Look at Kong chew toys instead for longer lasting toys .	-1
I have a 70lb goldendoodle who likes to chew and pick at things but is n't an aggressive chewer . I noticed within minutes that the little spiky nubs were falling off . Thankfully he was spitting them out and not swallowing them ! Not a safe toy .	-1
My 2 year old boy sheltie likes to chew , but he is far from a power chewer . He prefers softer chew toys , and he tends to pick and nibble at the inedible chew toys . But in about 10 minutes , he had the end of this flexible dental Nylabone torn off into two chunks . I noticed this when I looked over to see one little piece near him , and he was working the other little piece over in his mouth . He promptly spit it out when I asked him to , and gave him a cookie as a reward for doing so.I 'd say this dental toy is softer than the other Flexible Nylabones ( with those , he gets tiny , tiny pieces off , like grains of rice ) . Be very very careful giving this to your dog as it is n't an edible chew toy , yet it 's soft like an edible chew , and that 's a dangerous thing for dogs . Dogs are like toddlers , they will put all kinds of dangerous things in their mouth if we let them , so be careful with this chew toy . Or , you can not buy it in the first place and not take the risk . I wo n't buy this again for my pup . There 's only a small number of dogs who are the chewing type who would be okay with this chew toy ... . you know , like toothless dogs *might* be okay.The nubby texture of this dental Nylabone is great though , got my sheltie 's attention . He got a regular smooth flexible ( chicken flavor , I think ? ) Nylabone at the same time and he preferred the nubby texture of this dental bone .	-1
okay I have 3 dogs all over 50 lbs . I love nylabones . I do n't like this product . It is soft and flexible and has tons of little nubbies . The dogs will chew this apart it is a given but it should last a little while if they are n't an aggressive chewer . Mine are aggressive chewers and shredded this bone . Then the younger one proceeded to eat the pieces . This is not a hard nylabone so I do n't recommend to many people .	-1
It is just a hard plastic shape with spikes . My Cavalier puppy has n't touched it . Spend you money on something they will love Bully Sticks , keep teeth really clean and will clean off built up plaque like no other	-1
My 50+ pound puppy chewed this into pieces within 10 minutes . I was very disappointed that I purchased this . Not for the avid chewer .	-1
My 2 year old pit tore it to pieces in less than 5 minutes . NOT for strong chewers . Otherwise have fun cleaning up the mess .	-1
My adopted one year old dachshund/maltese mix is a real chewer . After she chewed her way through the corner of the table , a pillow , the credit card bill , an amazon packing box , and much more , I figured it was time to stock up on safer chew toys.I selected a number of products ( many of them produced by Nylabone ) and this proved to be the worst of those I purchased . My little dog was so happy when I gave it to her to chew , but within less than 10 minutes , she had chewed off large chunks of this toy and left them strewn all over the carpet . Nylabone recommend that a dog can safely ingest fragments of this product so long as they are no bigger than a grain of rice , but those that my dog chewed off were about the size of a fingernail . I was worried that she might become sick if she were to swallow any of these large pieces , so I took the product off of her and threw it away . My dog much prefers the Nylabone dinosaur shaped bones . They are extremely sturdy and have withstood her vigorous chewing for over two weeks now .	-1
I had to give this cat litter 1 star because of the HORRIBLE OVERPOWERING ammonia smell ! OMG ! I can barely clean it without wearing a face mask . My whole condo smells of the strong cat urine it 's horrible ! My eyes were watering and my nose was burning . I cleaned out the box almost every single day . Did n't have too many issues with the litter sticking to the box . It does stick , but I got it all up pretty easily . However , after just a few days the smell started . In less than a week it was so bad I had to dump out the whole box . This has happened 3 times now and I 've tried adding other products such as baking soda and other cat deodorizers . I have n't had problems with bugs , mice or anything like that . Have n't noticed any dust . The cats do track it everywhere all over the house . I even found some in my bedroom down the hall this morning . I have to vacuum pretty much every day . If anyone has any advice for the horrible smell I would appreciate it ! I am just desperately trying to make it through the bag right now so I can move on to something else ! I am loving that I do n't smell the poo at all , just the horrible urine which is now officially 100X worse ! I 'd rather smell the poo again ! UGH !	-1
Purchased Diamond Beef Meal and Rice - dogs loved it at first ... . I mixed it in with their old food and all was well for awhile , then I noticed that after about a week they stopped eating it all together . Even when I left it in to bowl and did n't give them their old food for a short period , they would n't eat it . I noticed vomit on the floor and saw my dogs both start to drink LOTS of water . Bad sign - giving up on this stuff . Read about their problems with recalls - bad choice to buy this product ! ! !	-1
I have been buying this and was happy with it for quite awhile then my last two purchases in the Fall of 2013 something is definitely different . All three dogs having severe gas and refusing to eat anymore of this stuff . Bought a fresh bag thinking I just got a bad bag..no its the food .	-1
I did n't get what picture and ingredients showed . So I went to Pet store to rebuy My dog 's treats . They did n't have duck potato lg size without hickory smoke either.the pet store was told the packaging would change . Picture very deceiving and Hickory Smoke flavor was NOT included in description nor size change . So Yes I was and am kind of disapointed . I may buy them again . I do n't knowthank you Peggy W.Actually they turned out to be good . My new little chihuahua mix pup loves them and my sweet Jeffery who has passed away loved them . review from 2 stars to 5 stars .	-1
This product is great for about 1-2 years . Over time , the motor will get bits and pieces of your pets ' fur and food , which causes the motor to break down , even with regular cleaning . I found no way to purchase a replacement motor , so I was really bummed ( as were my cats ! ) .I ended up purchasing a new fountain , but upgraded to theDrinkwell Platinum Pet Fountain . I highly recommend that fountain because it has a small guard that blocks food , fur , and other particles from getting into the motor and its ' reservoir .	-1
We previously we had this model ( the Petmate Deluxe Fresh Flow ) for about 2 years . The motor ran well and it never broke , so I gave it 2 stars . But it is an older outdated model and our pet store stopped carrying the filters . So I decided to upgrade to a newer product , the Drinkwell Platinum fountain.Drinkwell Platinum Pet FountainI would definitely recommend the Drinkwell and NOT this product . The new Drinkwell has been wonderful because I 've definitely seen all three of my cats drinking MUCH more water in the last two weeks than with the Petmate fountain . I can promise you I 've found the proof in the litter boxes.The Drinkwell 's water stream is much stronger and circulates the water better than the Petmate . It gives the water the power to move most of the debris toward the little trap . That keeps the water bowl so much cleaner ; where as with the Petmate , the debris would circulate until it either sank to the bottom or stuck to the bowl walls . In addition , the Drinkwell 's filter is designed SO much better ( 6 divided coal sections ) . The coal in the Petmate 's filter would just clump at the bottom ( i believe it has 2 divided sections ) .The Drinkwell also holds a lot more water . Both products are dishwasher safe , so regular washing is easy for either . However , I can say the old Petmate has many tiny corners which made it a pain when it came to scrubbing off the mineral deposit build up ( but my guess is the new one will be too ) .I would recommend paying the extra $ 20 and going for the Drinkwell Platinum and staying away from this old model .	-1
These are reasonably nice and quiet when they work right . However , it has been my experience that they eventually get noisy and that the durability is poor . I would not recommend these unless you plan on replacing it every few months .	-1
Noisy pump and splashy waterfall that made a halo of hard water stains . Only my Maine Coon Cat would go near it , drawn by the flowing water . Under the `` hood '' this fountain has TOO MANY ( unnecessary ? ) tight corners that harbor uncleanable areas . The best way I found to really clean the PetMate fountain was to remove the pump and submerge the parts in a pail containing a diluted bleach solution . While effective , it was time consuming and even with the most thorough of rinsing , my cat found the odor to be objectionable for the first 24 ( +/- ) hours . The little water reservoir is like filling an old fashioned water cooler - invert it quickly and hope for as little spillage as possible . I always seemed to end up soaking up a couple of paper towels getting the area dry enough for my cat 's tootsies . With only one cat using it , I gave up and donated it to my local shelter for their rummage sale.FWIW , I substituted one of those clear , plexi , three liter `` beta '' aquariums you can find at the pet store that comes with its own little power filter . There is n't any need for gravel or plastic plants , just the bare bones tank/bowl and the power filter which has it 's own easily changable carbon & floss cartridges that keeps the water fresh and clean . The water fall design of the power filter oxygenates the water and it has enough of a flow to keep my spoiled Maine Coon Cat happy . The smooth sides of the four sided tank/bowl quickly wipes clean . All three of my cats readily accepted this work-around for their pet water `` fountain '' . > ^ ! ! ^ & lt ;	-1
It does what it 's supposed to , but it 's LOUD ! The motor itself is n't bad , but it vibrates . So by itself , the motor is quiet , but once you mount it in the tank the vibration makes the whole thing loud as heck . I have n't figured out any way to stop it from being so noisy . Wrap the motor in bubble wrap , maybe.I had the original Petmate Deluxe , until the motor finally just quit after a few years , and it was great . This one , not so much . Quality has sunk . There is no more on/off switch on the power line . The disconnect is at the plug adapter instead of near the tank itself , making it difficult to unplug and lift out when it 's time for deep cleaning . There 's no flow adjustment , and the flow is rather slow.I 'm pretty disappointed with it and am considering returning it .	-1
My dog hates drinking stagnant water . I had to change her water bowls at least 3x a day . I figured I 'll solve my problem with this little cool invention ... After sitting for a bit , the `` filter '' proved useless when dust and little odds and ends are floating in it , obviously NOT being filtered ... . also , just because the water is supposedly SLOWLY circulating , does n't mean the water is `` fresh . '' I literally felt compelled to take this thing apart once per day to clean , and even then , break it down at least 2-3x a week to thoroughly get in the nooks and crannies ... not an easy job when you cant really get into the water reservoir where I imagine all sorts of mildew and mold , bacteria and algae will eventually accumlate.A BIG waste of money , a HUGE waste of time , an even LARGER inconvenience.I 'm back to my old ways of changing both her indoor and outdoor water bowls at least 3x a day , whenever I walk pass it , and just washing a simple bowl out at the ened of the night ... cheaper that way too ... no electricity to use , no fear of electrocutng my doggy , no pricey carbon filters to buy.Used it for 2 weeks and now its in another `` bad buy '' pile ... .	-1
The pump completely died on me after one year of use . I wish there was a better pump as these type of devices are clearly healthier than a standing water bowl , but without an effective pump they become useless.Someone also ought to make a better design such that water does n't slosh all over the floor when moving or picking the unit up . As I have to frequently clean the entire unit ( due to the weak pump ! ) this is a major issue .	-1
I have the large Petmate waterer and I love that one . The pump went out after about four years of continuous use . When I saw the price on the linen colored one , I thought instead of buying another large , I 'd try this medium size.Maybe it is the item I have vs. the entire medium size , but the top is extremely hard to take off , the reservoir does n't empty very quickly , and the water flow seems to be all or very little . Furthermore the depth of the drinking well is so shallow that the water level drops so quickly that I have to check it several times a day to make sure there is enough water for the pump to work efficiently . And as other reviewers have noted , it seems to get dirty faster than it should.The reason I gave it a two star rating rather than a one star is because I took the pump out of it and replaced the nonworking one in my large Petmate which I would give five stars to vs. this highly inefficient medium one ! Who knew that there was such a difference between a medium and a large water fountain from the same manufacturer and same line ?	-1
This is my third unit - I too let one run dry and the pump fried ( shame on me too ) , however it was about five years old and until the pump died , worked like a trouper . I have two units in my house , one at either end of the house.My cat drinks from the top of the water run and my dog slurps from the bowl ( dog backwash has got to be worse than cat backwash ! ) . Yes , I do dig out dog and cat hair from the intake/lever area about once a week , but that 's a small task compared to washing and filling a couple of water bowls each day or worse yet , forgetting to fill a bowl or finding one completely empty and wondering `` how long have they gone without water '' ? The pumps make enough `` noise '' when the water levels get too low , thus it 's nearly impossible to allow a pump to burn out ( nearly , not completely ! ) .There is no `` slimy '' feeling to the bowl like there is in a standard water bowl ( you know that `` film '' one often feels when cleaning a regular water bowl , despite the fact it looks clean ? ) and the large reservoir ensures plenty of water all the time ( although I do keep a 1/2 gallon container nearby each one so I can just fill and dump directly into the basin instead of pulling out the reservoir to refill - I do the latter frequently , but at times I 'm in a rush and a quick refill via the extra container does the trick for me.Lastly , my veterinarian noted my cat of 7.5lb cat of 18.5 years lived as long as she did , despite being a tiny runt who had been severely malnourished and abandoned when I found her up for adoption at about 1 year of age , because he found cats drink far more frequently with these units which , in turn , keeps their kidneys filtering properly and , in turn , keeps the kidneys working well overall - kidney woes often being the fatal ailment of cats.The dog ? Well , for whatever reason , she simply will not drink out of puddles or the odd bucket or container - could be a lucky coincidence , but I ca n't help but suspect she 's only known `` fresh water '' from the likes of this system and that 's her preference - no icky puddle water ingested means less of a chance of parasites or similar.UPDATE 5/29/10 - I had read others complaining the units leak ( other sites mostly ) and alas , I am now among the growing cluster o ' complainers . Late the other night I heard popping sounds and much to my dismay ( and total disgust ) I found the unit had been leaking ( probably about 3 days or so ) profusely the entire contents ( probably two full systems ' worth ) had soaked through the carpet and had severely buckled the original hardwood flooring to such an extent two planks are nearly buckled onto their sides ( hence the popping sounds I believe ) . I had `` assumed '' the dog and cat were simply drinking more because the weather was changing and did n't realize there was substantial leak ( never saw it , never felt it , but then I usually have shoes on ) - looking back , I had noticed a very loud `` water fall '' sound had started with the unit ( which some may like , but I found it annoying ) and I discovered the section that fits atop the pump had a small split in it . I did n't worry about it as it just meant that only 1/2 of the water was making its way up to the `` ramp '' , but I should have inspected the unit more carefully as I would have likely noticed signs of the major external leak that was probably developing ( although to look at the unit , empty as it is now , it 's not like there 's some gaping hole or visible crack in the base ) .Equally frustrating is the company 's customer service option - no email , no contact via a Web site , only snail mail and a M-F phone bank that 's routinely busy . I 've been a big fan of these units for many years , but given I 'm not the first person to whine about major leaking problems , I fear the company is either cutting corners or is using defective/inferior parts . The damage to the carpet is substantial - I had no idea mold would/could grow under a carpet in just a few days - but then I do n't have experience with leaving a few gallons of water on it - the carpet can be replaced , not that I really have a choice now - but the hardwood is another story , as fate would have it , I found , `` they no longer make the plank sizes '' , it 's custom hardwood time - oh brother . Until the company steps up and addresses the increasing leaking complaints , I hate to have to say it , but stay away from buying this model ( or if you have a unit now , place it on a plastic tray or similar ) . Formerly 5 stars .	-1
I 've had my Fresh Flow for a few years now and the unit works well . In fact , I purchased one for my mother 's pets . I 'm giving this fountain two stars because within the last year , the company has changed their filter replacements to this cheap piece of garbage that has barely any charcoal in it and slimes up quick . The new filters cost the same but now you have to replace them more often . I would think a cheaper product deserved a cheaper price , especially if you have to replace them more often . Check out the filters here on Amazon , you 'll see I 'm not the only one dissatisfied . Because of this , I am switching over to the Drinkwell system . I 've checked out their filter system and it looks a bit more substantial .	-1
I had a Drinkwell fountain for awhile , for my two cats at home . I also have two cats at work and decided to bring the Drinkwell in for them and I got one of these Fresh Flow fountains for home . I switched at home because I thought the Drinkwell was a pain to clean . The first time I changed out the Fresh Flow I was wishing I had just gotten another Drinkwell . The two main components of the Fresh Flow are easier to clean than the Drinkwell but the benefits stop there . The reservoir is very small and impossible to clean . The water in the bowl gets full of crud the very first day and it all just sits in the bottom ( Fur , bits of food , dirt from one cat 's paw who likes to dip his paw into the bowl ) . It needs to be cleaned constantly . The bowl part is too shallow and the water does n't seem to move out of the reservoir correctly , and the water level in the bowl gets too low and the pump makes sucking noises . The pump itself gets coated in slimy goo.My cats also prefer the actual waterfall the Drinkwell provides . I 've never seen them lap water from the plastic slide in the Fresh Flow . I gave it to a friend and bought another Drinkwell for home . Drinkwell filters are cheaper and easier to find , so even though it 's more expensive initially it turns out to be the better deal .	-1
I 've had this unit for over a year and while I like it better than a plain bowl of water , there are some flaws.The blue reservoir is growing algae in the corners and because of its shape , it 's impossible to clean those spots . I also have hard water in my apartment , so the slide gets a lot of hardwater build up which does n't come off with scrubbing . Finally , the thing is always getting clogged up with cat hair and weekly cleanings are necessary if you do n't want your cat drinking gross hairy water.I will likely purchase the type of fountain that comes down like a faucet whenever this one breaks but I wo n't buy this one again .	-1
Our cats just eat the power chord . One sticks her head in it and plays in it . I have bought bigger fountains from the same company before , only to have the motors die from build up of lime . The reservoir itself gets very laden with lime or whatever is In your water system . The filters can not prevent that . Other than just keeping the water running , it is a pain to clean and maintain .	-1
EDIT : I liked it . My cats liked it . But the d @ mn thing started leaking after only a month . Slow and gradual , but there was definitely a puddle on our wood floors every day that no towel could keep in check . It was thrown out . My kitties were upset . As was I ... what a waste of money !	-1
No matter what I do the water drips out the back of the thing . With in an hour there is a big puddle under it . It wics out the back seams where the filter goes . Buy a Drinkwell .	-1
I did n't think there 'd be another fountain as difficult to clean as a Drinkwell . This one is ( the right hand upper section must be removed , and it 's a bear to get off and on because it fits so tightly ) .Also - and this is not a criticism , because I misjudged capacity - but the medium size is not meant for a house with more than two cats .	-1
I had the old model of this fountain for 6 years - it was wonderful . The old model had an adjustable flow and was totally silent . The motor died on it finally . This new model does not have an adjustable water flow speed and is very loud , in fact mine was defective , the noise was too loud and my cat would not drink from it . A waste of time , energy and money to order this , assemble it , find out it doesnt work , call for return , pack it up and ship it back , and order a different brand , which I ordered the Drinkwell fountain hopefully i 'll have better luck with that one.Too bad they changed the design . Hint to Petmate : if its not broken , do n't fix it ! Add back the flow adjuster and make the motor silent again . Some cats are scared off by a noisy fountain that flows too fastUpdate 4-25-12 : Spoke to Petmate , they seem to think the loud pump noise is ok , they havent responded to two of my letters complaining about the loud pumps . I 've gone through 3 pumps now trying to get a quieter one , and they are all loud . They switched pump manufacturers and the new pumps they are making are lower quality louder and probably dont last as long . The very first Petmate fountain I ordered 10 years ago was extremely quiet , had an on/off switch and flow lever adjustment . The new pump is LOUD AND POOR QUALITY . PETMATE GET ON THE BALL WITH FIXING THESE LOUD PUMPS ! On the PLUS side , this water fountain design is the best out there in my opinion . My cat doesnt like dripping water and the water chute with water drinking area this one has is great . Could be the best pet fountain out there if they started doing quality and noise control on their pumps ! Probably sacificing quality for profit like most large companies today . The pumps are probably made in China sweatshops where everything is poor quality junk and the CEOs care more about their large salary than creating happy , satisfied customers . A sad commentary on American society and meanwhile my cat wo n't drink from this often enough because the noise makes him skittish .	-1
I have a cat that splashes water all over the kitchen even when the water is refreshed several times a day . Out of desperation I tried this fountain for her . It stopped the splashing , thank goodness , but now I had new problems.The reservoir is too small and if you do n't check it constantly it will go dry and that ruins the motor -- not to mention it is impossible to see the water level through the blue plastic unless you crouch down on the floor right next to it ! Hardwater scale builds up and is difficult to remove . It is very difficult to clean . I hated the fuss of cleaning it all the time and trying to watch it to make sure it did n't go dry . You ca n't even put it in the dishwasher ! I had a hard time finding replacement filters for it too . After only 3 months it stopped working . I went out and found a gravity fed water bowl that uses an air pump ( like for a fish tank ) to oxygenate the water and keep it moving/bubbling around . No fountain , but the cat does n't seem to mind and the splashing is still under control . Also I can put this one in the dishwasher and it is just so much easier to clean even by hand . I think it even cost a little bit less than this fountain . It holds tons more water too -- and it wo n't die if it should happen to go dry . Keep this in mind when you are looking for this type of product for your cats.By the way , my dogs have NEVER drank from either one -- they do n't even seem to know it is there , right under their nose , so the marketing to dogs is just plain silly . I only had one cat at the time the fountain died by the way . Just not a good design , not a good product .	-1
It 's great to have flowing water for cats . My cats love running water from the faucet . The water in this fountain is not running , though , but flows down a slope , so it 's difficult for the cats to even see the water running . My cats did n't drink from the part where the water was running . I later bought a different flowing water pet fountain that runs more like a faucet , but we no longer use that one either because it is plastic and our vet recommended that cats should only eat and drink out of glass bowls , not plastic . Apparently the plastic containers can cause irritations . One of my cats had a swollen lip and the vet suspected the plastic water dish as the culprit . Too bad no one has made a glass flowing water fountain !	-1
I purchased this product ( medium size ) from another website eight years ago . The product worked well and my six cats used it without any problems . The pump worked fine as long as it was regularly cleaned . The major drawback was that the bowl and its various parts were difficult to clean and even more so for me since I have well water and the mineral build up was particularly hard to remove . Then last week the electrical cord actually separated from the pump at the point of entry into the pump itself . I have several small and large water fountains which use pumps and have never had this happen before . But the pump did have some age on it so I began to search for a replacement . The original pump was a Jebao model PP-333-LV . However , the same model is now a different size and lacks the flow control valve . I checked the Jebao website , the Petmate website and many , many other websites in an attempt to find a compatible pump . I was successful only in wasting my time and elevating my blood pressure . The construction of the compartment for the pump is such that you must have the exact same size or it just wo n't work . It has to fit perfectly . I noticed that others who had commented on the same problem cobbled together parts from their old pump along with a new one with satisfactory results . I decided against this route and began to research other pet water fountains . After reading the comments accompanying each it became apparent that each had its own problems.So I decided to make my own . All you need is an aquarium circulating filter ( I used the Tetra Whisper PF10 , about $ 14 ) , a large glass , stainless steel or ceramic bowl and some glass pebbles ( optional ) . I had a beautiful antique crockery bowl lined in blue ceramic that was just collecting dust ( 5 '' deep by 9 1/4 '' diameter ) which was perfect for the project because it has a 3 '' wide straight band around the top , like a clay flower pot , which holds the clip-on aquarium filter straight up without any shimming . A large straight sided glass salad bowl would also work beautifully . I added some polished glass beads in the bottom to catch the usual debris and it works like a charm - so easy to clean . Google `` make your own pet fountain '' for detailed instructions . And the best part , my cats love it . I gave this product one star because it 's hard to clean , I could not find a replacement pump which fit and Petmate does not have online customer service to answer questions . My Petmate bowl is now in the plastic recycling bin .	-1
I had purchased the Petmate Deluxe model of the 50-ounce Pet Fountain for my cats . That works exactly as described and my cats drink more than they did from bowls of water around the house . I like blue , and the basic model seemed as if it would perform the same as the deluxe model . My cats still drink from this model , but it does n't fit together as well as the deluxe model and , as a result , it often leaks , leaving puddles around it . If I purchase another , I will only get the Deluxe model .	-1
I received the PetMate FreshFlow in November , 2005 , and put it to work right away . My wife and I have six cats , ranging from longhair to shorthair to haireverywhere , and I am pretty sure they all drank from it . They became accustomed to it very quickly , the youngest being absolutely fascinated by it . The entire time , I also had a high-capacity gravity-fed waterer in another room , so it was n't the only source of water being used.Most noticible is that the FreshFlow is almost silent when the water is topped off , but if the water level falls , there is a very discernable motorized-gurgling noise . This goes away as soon as you refill the reservoir tank by removing the lid , pulling out the tank ( which reminds me a bit of a gerbil waterer on steroids ) , unscrewing the cap , filling it up , then doing all this in reverse ; a 30-second process.The gurgling happens every day , and I would rinse the unit every couple/few days , and completely wash the unit out once every two weeks . I also changed the filter regularly , at least once a month . Beyond this , I made a point of pulling cat hair away from the little plastic screen in the water bowl , well , all the time . In short , I thought I did a pretty good job in maintaining the equipment . Any more than what I did , and honestly , I would rather buy surgical steel dishes and rotate them on a daily basis for the cat 's use.Still , after taking the machine apart completely every few weeks to clean as instructed , the submersible pump failed after exactly 19 weeks and three days of use . I liked the machine ... when it was working.I just purchased a pet fountain from a different company ( I ca n't recall the make offhand ... I should be receiving it soon ) that ran in the $ 40 neighborhood , and I think it will be worth the extra money , but time will tell.All in all , I do n't think this purchase was worth it . Maybe it 's because of all the cats and cat hair , but for those of us at least who do have a multiple cat household , I think it 's wise to consider buying a higher-scale unit .	-1
I had one of these I bought when they first hit the market because I have a cat who loves to drink from faucets . He loved the fountain ! After about 8 years of working great the water flow valve broke . I bought this one a couple of months ago and even though the fountain works great and my cat is happy with it , the auto fill cap on the bottom of the reservoir does n't work at all . I ca n't figure out why and have tried every thing I can think of to get it to work . The first one worked fine , filling the bowl automatically as the water level went down . With this new one I have to do it manually . I make sure the bowl is filled to nearly overflowing every morning so that I do n't have to worry about the water dropping so low that the pump does n't have enough water to pump while I 'm at work all day . Not sure if this one is just a lemon or if the design has been changed ? ? ? When I replace this one , it will be with a different model !	-1
My cat loves to drink from this fountain and uses it more than she would a regular bowl . I introduced it to her at 3 years old after using a bowl her whole life and it took a while for her to get use to , but she loves it now . The fountain worked great for a while ... .but after a couple of weeks it started becoming very noisy . This fountain is very picky . If any little thing is bothering it , it makes a tremendous amount of sound and it is a pain to figure out what exactly is bothering it . So this kind of defeats the purpose of it being a self-cleaning fountain . It also does not recycle the water very well . The water still gets very dirty and I see pieces all the time that do n't go through the filter . I think the filter is actually cleaner than the actual water my cat drinks from when I go to change the filter every month . I would n't really recommend this product ... After having it for about 3 months I need something more efficient ...	-1
We have one of these and one Drinkwell , and the kitties seem equally happy with either one . The Petmate is a bit quieter , but is even more difficult to clean , which needs to be done more often than I 'd like . Neither one is a day at the beach to clean , but the Petmate has even more little nooks and crannies and narrow little spots that are almost impossible to get the gunk out of . And as soon as you 're done and fill it with fresh water , it starts getting icky again before you know it . Since there 's no obvious useful purpose for all the little hard to reach spots , I can only conclude that whoever designed these things likes cats OK , but hates their owners .	-1
I ordered the Petmate Fresh Flow , having owned one in the past that my cats liked but I thought was a pain to clean . I was surprised when I opened the package to find a box labled `` aspen pet cool flow . '' It was an awful lavender color , but otherwise looked the same . Thought about returning it right away because I was angry it was a different fountain , but my cat was sick and I really wanted it to work out . It worked fine when I plugged it in but after a couple hours , a loud buzzing sound started and never stopped . I tried adding water just in case I did n't have enough but to no avail . Unplugged it , dumped all the water out , started all over-same buzzing noise . My cats would n't touch it with that noise going on.I really think Amazon needs to change the product description and picture to match what they actually send you . According to other reviewers , the product has been `` updated '' but it 's now a different color and does n't work the same-if I had known it was different , I would never have risked ordering it .	-1
- `` Problems , Problems , Problems All Day Long '' Like the old Everly Brothers song , this product has been nothing but ongoing problems . The little tank in the back never drains properly , the fountain does n't run well for more than a day without some kind of an assist , the little screen that 's supposed to catch debris before it 's pulled into the filtration system is a nightmare to remove and reinstall ... ... and so it goes on and on . TOTAL WASTE OF MONEY ! I should have sent it back , but I 'm usually very handy with gadgets of all kinds , and just kept believing I could make this 'lemon ' work well . I was wrong this time . DO N'T BUY THIS ONE ... GET SOMETHING IN CERAMIC OR STAINLESS STEEL INSTEAD , FROM ANOTHER COMPANY ! ! ! PETMATE SHOULD BE ASHAMED OF THIS INFERIOR PRODUCT !	-1
I had this for less than three days . The first day it was great . I wish it gurgled more for the cat but it was fine . The last day I noticed that it seemed to be going through water quickly for one cat . Then I noticed the throw rug was saturated . Then i noticed the discoloration of the hardwood floors . Then i noticed the wet spot in the basement . I checked to see if the water container was screwed on correctly . Then i placed it on a dry towel on the kitchen counter . Within an hour the towel was saturated . Luckily I bought it at Walmart . Back it went but instead of putting it aside so that some other poor peeson would not be sold this piece of crap . They put it aside to be reshelved . I wish I could give this 0 stars.If this fails on you it could do major damage before you discover it .	-1
Clearly when you get these if you have ever purchased a small , medium , large or xl cat box you will soon find this would be small for a tiny kitten . It is more a tub to keep pens and art supplies in than a simple and functional litter box . I checked the measurements prior to purchase with another of my boxes but when it arrived , it was no where near a cat box size . Having said that , if it had been a usable simple litter box and not a storage tub without a lid , then I suppose it would have been okay . Nothing special . No frills . Just a box . Maybe for emergency travel or one-off situations where nothing else is available , but you would be better off in that situation to use a box flat and a kitty liner . Sadly I missed the return date by one day ( I will call Amazon tomorrow to discuss ) due to illness so now I may be stuck with two unusable boxes .	-1
The height of the pan is fine , but the length and width of the pan are SMALL.The only time I will use it is when I am washing out the other litter pans , to stand in as a place holder.Otherwise , it is not functional for my full grown cats .	-1
Not high back style like picture shows . In fact the item is very different from style shown . I am not impressed at all . Like another customer said I could get the same thing for less money at a dollar store . Item needs a much better description as I would not recommend this item .	-1
Same product as Purina One , different bag . I even had the kibbles to compare side by side and they look identical ( shape , size , color , smell ) . Our cat would not eat the Purina One so we got him this one . He wo n't touch it either.Ingredients list is almost identical , I think they swapped a 2 ingredients ' places in the line , to make it look different when really they are about the same amount and the same formula.Rip off ! If your cat loves this , get Purina One , you 'll save about half the cost !	-1
PLEASE read the first few main ingredients before buying the product . Do not look at how fancy the wordings look but look at the actual ingredients that your cats will eat . Most of these food contain-1 - Chicken By-Product Meal -- `` dry , ground , rendered clean parts of the chicken carcass . `` 2 - Whole Grain Corn -- grains = high carbs = fat.3 - Animal Fat ( preserved with Mixed Tocopherols and Citric Acid ) -- a tocopherol is pretty much a form of vitamin E.4 - Corn Gluten Meal -- that 's a protein corn by-product ; it 's a little deficient in lysine , so it should n't be the only protein source , which it is n't . ( Yes , your pet can digest it just fine ) .5 - Brewers Rice -- another by-product , leftovers from the milling process.Please consider Grain-fee food for your cat if you want it to live a longer life because grain-free obviously does n't contain grains , leftover meats , and the price is almost the same as these cheap 'craps ' .	-1
All these urinary health foods seem to be lacking in any kind of appeal for cats , and this brand/flavor did n't go over at all with the cat who is supposed to be eating it , or any of the cats who do n't need it.But every cat is different . Wish they sold smaller sample bags .	-1
I have a 2 year old male tabby and a 6 year old female tuxedo cat . Both of them are slightly overweight so I started feeding them this dry cat food for a little over a year . 4 month ago my male cat developed urinary track blockage ( crystal ) so we have to keep him on canned food diet . We could n't be sure the exact cause of the blockage ( food , stress , genetic ... ) My female cat would not eat canned food so we let her keep eating Pro Plan 's Weight Management dry cat food.Now my female cat got urinary track blockage as well ! I am kicking myself have been keeping her on this dry food.Do not feed your cat this food . Urinary track blockage is very costly to treat . Once they get it , it could be a life long battle . Be carful ! Update : 4/17/2014My female cat has been on diff brand of cat food ( Wysong ) since I took her off ProPlan 's Weight Management Formula . I noticed her skin flakes improved ! It also made a huge difference in the amount of pee she produces . This is a good thing and will help to keep any future blockage away .	-1
Pros : CheapCat loves itCons : His skin and coat got worseHis vomiting got worseHe developed an allergic rashKitty loved this food and it is very affordable so , knowing that he has a sensitive stomach and skin , I was eager to give it a try . Well , this food was like the atomicvomit bomb and his skin and allergy issues got worse . So ... did n't work for me as advertised .	-1
This is not a good food for my kitties..she puked all day from the food . I had to get rid of it as they do not return unopened bags of cat food .	-1

After receiving the product in the mail , I read the package that this bone is made of nylon and contrary to description , it is NOT edible.I left my 20 pound dog chew on it and after a few hours it was already scrapped and used-up . I usually leave her playing with the bone for an hour or so , and she began to feel really sick in the morning.Last night I let her play with the bone for a couple of hours during dinner , and this morning she threw up and was very sick . This bone made my dog sick , so it 's going in the garbage and getting a bad review .	-1
We prefer nylabone products but got this knowing it would be softer for our new puppy . We she had the center part torn up in no time and she was only about 10 weeks old . Our 9 year old lab got ahold of it for 2 minutes and snapped the thing literally in half , that was it . So I would n't buy it again because it wo n't last .	-1
my dog did not even chew on it once . It is made very well but beware , not all dogs like to chew on plastic . Probably going to try antler next .	-1
My dog LOVES heat so I thought this would be perfect to put in her cage while we are at work . I buried it underneath the blankets , and had the blue cover over it . She ripped off the blue cover and chewed all the way around the warmer , and punctured it so I ca n't use it at all.Now I 'm stuck with the blue cover , paw print cover , and dog stuffed animal.The warmer is a lot harder than I thought it was , so I can see how some dogs would n't find it very comfortable to lay on , but if you use the stuffed animal the heat does n't go through it very well.The one good thing is I was surprised at how long it stayed warm .	-1
Multiple times I have heated the SnuggleSafe according to the directions , and the pad never gets hot enough to generate enough heat to penetrate the fleece cover . It does n't radiate heat the way I had hoped it would . I 'm afraid to overheat the pad in the microwave ( as the instructions caution against ) , and I worry the pad will be too hot for my pet if I remove the pad from the cover . I should have thought better about buying the SnuggleSafe anyway - from the pictures it 's obviously very hard and probably not comfortable to lie on . ( If you pad it more , then the heat will never get through to your pet . ) My cat has no interest in it .	-1
This is a very good idea but it is too hard to be comfortable and is ignored . When placed inside the bed , even against the side and not on the bottom , the cat sleeps elsewhere.I had great hopes for this . It might work fine for other pets so your mileage may vary .	-1
I bought this and , not knowing the wattage of our microwave , slowly ramped up the heating time once a day to try out this disk , see how warm it got , and how long it stayed warm.After a few trials , the disk definitely got as warm ( 123 degrees ) as advertised , but it absolutely did not stay warm for the 12 hours it promised . It has also gotten kind of warp-y , after just 3 uses : (	-1
Did n't work for us . Pups would n't go near it . Why choose a rock hard disc ( albeit swaddled in a towel ) when mom is much more comfy .	-1
I called Wellness 6/24/13 and complained about the 13.5 ounce Wellness cat Turkey and Salmon and they told me that the MW is from the West Coast plant and we , on the East Coast are not used to it . She said the formulas are the same but the consistency is looser . None of the stray/feral cats outside eat it the Turkey and Salmon with the MW on the can 's bottom and none of our indoor cats will either . I buy 10 cases of the 12.5 ounce cans . a month . Bad ingredients or something - it does not smell the same at all as the cans with the 7WRT on the bottom . THe MW cans are a soupy non-fishy smelling mess.I have been using Wellness for over 8 years now and this is the worst I have ever seen of their canned cat food . It has been soupy before but not like this gray mess . The rep at Wellness told me that this should only last a couple of more months until their warehouse is cleaned out . I am looking for a new grain free canned cat food in the mean time . I buy way to much healthy cat food to keep my vet bills down and my pets healthy to spend it on a product that my pets will not eat due to a manufacturing problem . Thank you to Amazon for letting me return the unused cases ! .	-1
I switched from Advantix II to this b/c the ticks around here are bad in the summer but in the end , none of them worked . What I have been using and it has worked since is Pet Naturals spray which is a mix of natural products and you simply spray the dog before a walk and it prevents the ticks from attaching to the dog in the first place and that has worked and I have been using it for years . The plus side is it is all Natural and not a chemical like Frontline or K9 Advantix which is a big plus . Also a little drop of apple cider or vinegar on their treat is another natural repellant and great for their immune system . During peak seasons of ticks when it is warm ill drop some on their treats once every week and even that little amount helps .	-1
I applied this to my 18 lb . Miniature Schnauzer and within 2 weeks I saw live fleas and ticks on him . Switched to K9 Advantix II and so far he 's been clean after a month .	-1
My dog got 2 ticks and fleas while on this product . I had to switch to something else . I live in upstate NY so I do n't know if that has something to do with the kinds of fleas and ticks we get .	-1
When we first started using it seemed to work well . Now it seems like the fleas are getting drunk off the frontline and flourishing .	-1
I have tried this , Advantage and recently , Frontline Tritak . I 'm going to try Activyl now . I 'm keeping my fingers crossed .	-1
but she still itches after this stuff . i do n't know if it 's not sinking into her skin or only lasts for so long . she 's a small Chi , and a few weeks into it she 's scratching the hell out of herself .	-1
I got this from a store and put it on my dog . It was not doing anything for her for fleas . I called the vet and they said a lot of people are having problems with Frontline not working and suggested I switched her over to Advantage .	-1
Kills & Repels ticks , but not so good with keeping fleas off like the product use to be . booo	-1
I put it on my dog and in less than a week she was itching fleas again ! ! ! dosent work dosent work do n't waste your money	-1
I bought this for my two dogs because we were having a problem with ticks . I kept finding them on their fur , and while they were n't attached the whole thing made me really nervous . My dog Yogi had been given this product before we brought him home from the shelter , and since he never had fleas it seemed like it was working well . When I received it I put it on both of my dogs -- Toby & Yogi . Yogi did fine ; Toby was an entirely different story . After 30-40 minutes , he was shaking , vomiting , lethargic , had accidents in the house . I was terrified ! I called Merial to speak with one of their `` vet techs '' about what was happening , and they said there was no way to get the product off and there was no one there who could explain to me what to do or who to contact ( emergency vet ? poison control ? ) or what was happening . They actually told me to call back TOMORROW . I called my vet who gave me the number of an emergency vet . The emergency vet told me to scrub off the frontline with dawn dish soap and to watch him for improvement . Sure enough , an hour after getting it all scrubbed off , he was still very weak and tired but no longer vomiting or shaking . I called my vet today to let them know that he was okay . I 'm not bothering with Merial . I can not understand why they would sell a product and advertise vet techs on staff and then have absolutely no recourse or help when a negative side effect occurs . Amazon was much better to deal with for this issue . They allowed me to send the product back for a refund even though it had been opened . I 'm glad that they stand by the items they sell . I 'm going to stick with eucalyptus oil and tea tree oil for my dog . It works well with a flea comb , but it is more work .	-1
After trying PetArmour which did n't work , I read all the reviews on Frontline and tried it . IT DID NOT WORK either ! ! ! 5/10/13 UPDATE : Capstar is a great product , it got rid of the fleas on the dog within 30 mins and then we followed up with the K9 Advantix II . Has been 3 weeks & both of these products worked wonderfully and we will continue to buy them . Wasted money on PetArmour and Frontline , do n't do it .	-1
this stuff did not work ! do not buy this , its weak and not water proof.my house was covered and my dogs were loaded ! ! it only worked for 10 days .	-1
Ok , so I have a Scottish Terrier that has severe flea allergy and we have used frontlineplus for almost 4 years with no problems , and not one flea.The past few months that I have used this recent order from amazon.com she got fleas at the end of themonth . I am assuming either I got a bad batch , or it did n't work the full month.Either way , I am scared to use frontline plus for her anymore . She got huge sores , whelps , hairloss and it cost me 150.00 in vet bills as well as more money buying other prevention and differentshampoos for her .	-1
i have used frontline for years on my dogs and cats but recently it does not work , i have bought it from several places thinking one batch was no good , but they are all ineffective , so disappointed in this product that was once so good . will never buy again .	-1
I 've gone through several sites looking for the best price for Frontline and I always come back to Amazon.com because they have the best prices . The problem is that I have noticed it 's not as effective as it used to be ... plus too many chemicals , so I took my dogs completely off all flea meds and they are doing fine .	-1
I was tired of spending gazillions on frontline whether buying stateside or from overseas . Let 's face it folks , we are putting poison directly on the dogs and paying a pretty penny to do it . I have three dogs and between the guilt/expense factor of using this stuff I did my homework and here 's what I came up with . I had 3 vials of frontline left just in case my compound failed . The last time I put frontline on my pups was February 2013 and it 's now October 2013 . What I used is this : spray bottle , 1 Cup water ( tap ) , 2 Tablespoons of Skin So Soft ( the new version works ) , a good cap full of store brand listerine ( gold colored ) , 3 Tablespoons of white vinegar ( store brand works ) . Shake it all up and spray your pup neck down to tail , chest ( do n't let it get in their face ) , put some mixture on your hand and spread on top of head from ear to the other ear . Yes , spray the belly . I sprayed them once per day during the heavy flea season ... .not one flea ... ZERO . I still have those 3 unused vials of frontline and I feel better since I 'm not putting poison on my dogs and my wallet is happier as well . Lastly , the `` listerine '' and vinegar have wonderful anti-fungal type properties on their own which is fantastic .	-1
I typically purchase flea products from my vet and normally get Frontline for the dogs . For whatever reason this did n't seem to work as well . It appears to be the same product but for the first time in years we ended up with fleas . I went to the vet about 30 days after I noticed the first flea ( and after realizing we were starting to have a real problem ) and purchased Frontline from them and applied it to the dogs . After just 2 weeks I 've noticed - no more fleas . I do not know if the infestation was a direct result of buying this product online but I wont take the chance again .	-1
Works great on ticks but it is horrible on killing fleas . My Maltese dog is covered in flea dirt and fleas . I have never seen a flea product perform so poorly . Can 't wait to try something else next month .	-1
I have been using Frontline for over 15 years . Recently , there have been many complaints about it not being effective any longer . I will have to say that is true . I applied this to all 3 dogs on April 1st - by April 24 , I had found engorged ticks on all 3 . One of my dogs has Lymes Disease and the other 2 have been vaccinated so that 's not the worry .	-1
This stuff seems to make no difference at all . I 've bought it from several sources including the vet , Amazon , and Costco . At 10 bucks per application I 'm thinking someone is getting rich selling oily water.We have two labs and a golden . The dogs stay mostly in the house and fleas have never been a problem before this year ( probably the crazy mild winter ) . I hate chemicals but we 've had to treat the yard , house , carpets , furniture . I wash their bedding and vacuum at least every other day . They get Sentinel for heartworm + fleas . I use a flea comb and baths with flea soap . I tried many herbal products but they absolutely do n't do anything ; at least with the flea soap I can see the fleas dying and getting rinsed off . Poor Poochies ! ! ! In years past I remember using a horrible product that left an oily patch on the dog 's shoulders for weeks but this stuff seems to disappear within a couple of days . It 's gone in a day if I let them swim in the pool , even though the packaging claims it 's water resistant . So my pool is probably toxic , too . After spending a few hundred bucks so far I wo n't be buying this again .	-1
order this for my 3 poodles and 1 beagle ... .they all suffered miserably from it not working ... .it didnt work at all . advantage is waaaaaaaay better	-1
At first it seemed to be working . It seemed to get rid of the fleas . None to be found after a few days . Whoo Hoo ! But then after the first 10 days , they were back . I thought the eggs must have hatched that were in the house and they too will be gone after they bite the dog ... nope . The fleas seem to be worse now than before . ( not that frontline made them WORSE ) But the effectiveness seemed to wear off after about 10 days ! That is a huge cost for just a few days coverage . : ( I groom , raise dogs and do rescue work ... . It cost a small fortune to get frontline for everyone and now seems like it was a waste . I have doses for one more round ... hope it does better this time .	-1
Historically , my family has had great success with frontline . I do n't want to discourage anyone from trying it because I know it can work ( based on the flea population characteristics your dog comes in contact with ) .We had been using this for 2 months when my dog went to a friends house while we were on vacation . When we got back , he had fleas galore . We put on the next frontline a week early and it did not even phase the fleas on him.We switched to K9 advantix II and the fleas were gone within a couple of days . I know that some fleas are now resistant to Frontline , and that certainly seemed to be the case for the fleas on my dog . I would recommend not buying any more than a 3 month supply at a time in case your dog gets fleas like mine that are n't phased by frontline . If you try Frontline and it does n't work , k9 advantix II might , as it did for me .	-1
Our dog is an American Eskimo and we live in Miami , Florida . We have exterminated the yard , his bedding and had been using the Preventic Collar . We also used Rose Geranium oil , all with no success of the tick infestation on our dog.We finally tried Frontline Plus and it has been a couple of weeks now and we are still having the same tick problem . Adult ticks and baby ticks . It 's not doing a thing to help get rid of the tick problem so far.There are no fleas at all and plenty of ticks on the dog every day .	-1
2 stars because it worked last year ... .had this been my first experience , it would have received 1 star.I used this exact same product last year on 7 cats and one 25 # dog . I buy this size because it 's cheaper than buying a bunch of convenience doses . I just make certain that I get the correct dose by weight of animal . Last year , it worked really well . It took about 4 weeks to really see a huge impact , but it controlled the problem.This year , we have 6 indoor cats , 2 outdoor cats ( sometimes 4 ) and a 25 # dog ... . I started them on it earlier because our insect season started earlier ... no effect ! After 2 doses and waiting 9 weeks total , there was an increase in flea population . I would blame it on the two of us humans , but my spouse reacts BAADLY to flea bites and does n't get lazy when it comes to cleaning as a preventative ! He looks like someone beat him with a flail ... .and the itching drives him loopy ! ! We do n't have rugs , ALLLL wood floor , NOTHING with upholstery or fabric except our bed . He uses diatomaceous earth dust on the floors , then vacuums that up , followed by mopping with bleach and flea shampoo . That he did on a daily or every other day basis ... .to no avail ! The animals were still infested . I actually shaved the dog because she chewed her rump bloody ! ! ! After giving the second dose a couple weeks to work , I ordered Advantage II . That arrived , and we waited until it was time to do the third dose ( we did n't want to overdose anyone ) . We can see the difference already ! We have a litter of new kittens that we gave a flea bath to and immediately were reinfested with adult fleas ... .after dosing their mother with the new Advantage II , there are not any adult fleas visible on her babies ! Do n't know what happened with the Frontline ? ? It failed us this time . Does it expire ? ? There are n't any expiration dates on the package ... Frontline , what happened ? ? ?	-1
Not knowing any better , I treated my 20 lb . rescue , mixed breed with Frontline Plus for several years . I would stop treatment in the cold , winter months thinking I 'd give his system a break . Upon resumption of treatment , my little guy had a seizure -- eyes rolled back , involuntary shaking and tremors -- lasting about 30 seconds to a minute . The second time it happened it dawned on me that it must be a reaction to either Frontline or heartworm treatment . I stopped applying Frontline and there have been no seizures that I 'm aware of -- and I 'm with the dog 24-7 . The Frontline was purchased from the vet and I reported the problem to him . He said he 'd had other reports of the product causing problems or simply not working . I would advise anyone to Google flea prevention and read about what we 're administering to our pets . There are safe alternatives . We do n't need to poison our pets for our convenience .	-1
I have used this for years without a problem , but I believe that they have changed the formula , because it quit working a few months ago when I bought my new batch . My vet said that they have gotten a lot of similar complaints , and that long time users have switched to other products . I am now using Advantix which works great , and also is supposed to repel mosquitoes , but there have been some cases where Advantix causes a skin reaction in some dogs , so you might want to try a single dose before buying an entire package.I wonder if these mail order purchases are old stock from before a possible formula change .	-1
Normally , I love Frontline Plus for my dog . However , I chose to order this from Amazon because the price was cheaper . This frontline did not work at all . Something was wrong with it . I order alot of `` thinks '' from Amazon and never had trouble before . I have had dogs all of my life , used frontline plus ever since it came out , and it always worked . I ended up buying Frontline Plus from another reliable place and it works `` great '' just like it always did . This was a bad batch .	-1
I sent this product back because it was a KNOCKOFF ! Very subtle , but my vet confirmed it , and we 've been going to her for over 5 years so I know she 's telling the truth ! I ended up going to 1800PetMeds because they guarantee their products are authentic . I buy products on Amazon all the time , but for something as important as my dog , there will be no more bargain hunting on Amazon for something like this . Spend the extra $ to get the authentic product . Amazon is great for a lot of things , but should put a LOT more focus on protecting its customers ! ! Counterfeit products from China , and other Asian countries can be VERY dangerous and if you love your pet like I do -- paying more is far cheaper than a vet bill ! DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT !	-1
I have given frontline to my dogs before , however this past year it seems like it has not done the trick . I cant find anything that works , and my vet and everyone else has told me the same : (	-1
I 've been using Frontline products for years and not had any trouble . This year , the Frontline does n't seem to be as effective against the fleas . When i asked my vet , they told me that a lot of people had been having problems with the fleas while using Frontline . The fleas seem to becoming resistant to some of the flea products like K9 Advantix , Advantage and Frontline . The vet suggested Vectra 3D as an alternative that seems to still be effective . I 'm trying that next month .	-1
My dogs have been having seizures on an almost regular monthly basis since they were 4 months old ( they are littermates ) . I only started recently searching about the relationship between Frontline and seizures , and there are SO MANY people whose pets have had seizures from Frontline . Your vet will deny it but there are too many people who have reported it . Sure enough , I realized my dogs were having seizures 1-2 days after each application of the preventative.This product may work well on some dogs , but for mine , the evidence is clear and the Frontline has been causing seizures in my dogs.I 'm switching to a gentler , natural brand .	-1
OK , I hate to leave negative feedback , but Frontline just does n't work . It only works for 7-10 days , and the fleas start coming.I 've had my dog for only 6 months , and I started using Frontline Plus right away . As soon as the weather started getting warmer , I started dealing with flea problems . I thought maybe the Frontline I got off of eBay had gone bad or was fraud . I bought some on Amazon , and it was the same . It only works for 10 days max , then the fleas start coming back . Now I got fleas in my apartment and have to deal with chemicals to get rid of them.I took my dog to the vet yesterday and she said a lot of customers are saying the same thing to her , and recommended I change the treatment to another brand.Stay away until they get their act together .	-1
I 'm suspicious of the packaging because I 've never seen it , and it does not match the picture shown . The package I received has a different dog on it , and the UPC has been replaced with a sticker with a different UPC on it . I am returning this because it does not match the packaging at my vet , nor at other pet websites that sell Frontline Plus , approved in the U.S.Update : Surprisingly , Amazon will not allow a return on this item because it 's considered hazardous . So with that thought in mind , buyer beware .	-1
keeps the fleas from creating a home by killing them within three days but does not keep my dog comfortable while they are biting him for three days after we walk outside and he brings them in the house - i think this is great for a person who has a indoor pet and they do not walk the dog outside or have it around other dogs	-1
I recently used this on my chihuahuas . One of them started to have a bad reaction within 8 hours ... restless , body aches , very lethargic . I looked up side effects and you should too ... .BEFORE applying this highly toxic stuff to you beloved pet ! ! On the advice of those who have had dogs die from this product , I immediately gave both chihuahuas baths in Dawn Dish Soap to get it off of them . His symptoms IMMEDIATELY improved , and he has fortunately been fine . Also , I had not used the entire tube on them , since they are 5 lb dogs I only put a small amount on them each . I fear if i had put the entire amount and not washed it off so soon , i would 've had some really serious side effects from this product . i do NOT recommend it , and I urge you to read up on this product thoroughly and consider not using it at all if you love your dog ! The vets will tell you it 's safe ... .i 'm here to tell you IT 'S NOT .	-1
I have always used frontline plus on my many dogs but this year , my pom got sick when I used it on her , she couldnt get enough to drink and was panting alot I mean alot she layed around and didnt want to go out with me to walk or even in the yard , and the front of her chest area was ringing wet from her panting not from the water not satisfied with this product anymore and I 've heard of more people complaining that frontline is not the same as it used to be , , I am not using it on my pom because I do n't want her sickagain..	-1
We had been using this product faithfully for several years , year round . However , it stopped working the last 2 summers . I understand that there was a big flea problem but the Frontline did n't appear to be doing anything ! Very active fleas were running relays on our dog ! Sent back and will not use again .	-1
I used it for a few years but alas , probably because the fleas acquire resistance , it no longer works . I 've switched to Advantix and it does . Of course , I 'm concerned , societally , that as with antibiotics , it 's an endless battle . I hope we keep developing effective ( and safe ! ) flea controls and antibiotics , but it 's hard to remain optimistic that we always will . Of course , the world may well have ended before then -- for example , some terrorist scientist creating a highly communicable mutated smallpox virus that he released in a public place .	-1
This stuff smelled so chemically and one of my dog 's got sick after I applied it . We 've used a lot of meds over the years but this batch seems off or something . I will use a different brand from now on .	-1
ok first of all seller changes his seller name all the time , so beware of that . do not rely on looking for the name of a BAD seller to do more shopping ! 2nd . they advertise this product as FRONTLINE PLUS ! BUT WHEN YOU CLICK THEIR AD , the product is FRONTLINE TOP SPOT ! ... .not the same , and it is the reason it is cheap . look it up ... frontline top spot does NOT kill flea larvae or eggs , so you only kill the adults . not good and a waste of money ! **** HONESTLY IT IS A big GAMBLE TO BYE FRONTLINE ANYMORE HERE . hard to catch the scammer !	-1
I have used Frontline for years , and in the last 4 or 5 , it is different . It doens't work as well as it once did , and I lost a cat because of it . She had symptoms of poison . The vet suggested it might be antifreeze . I live in the country with no home nearby , and how many actually put antifreeze in their own vehicles nowadays ? My dog had a seizure and it took reading this discussion to figure out it was Frontline all along , poisoning my pets ! ! I thought my dog just old , but in retrospect , each time I put it on him he reacted quickly with the seizures and throwing up . Thanks to everyone posting on Amazon discussions about the dangers of Frontline ! I do n't want to put even one star on this rating but it makes me before it will post..	-1
When I initially started using Frontline Plus on my dog a few years ago it seemed to work for more than a couple of weeks . Either the groomer or I would bathe her and wait at least one day prior to applying the product to make sure her coat was totally dry . For two or three years she was virtually flea-free for at least three weeks out of four . Unfortunately , over time I might as well have put water on her back , as the product stopped killing the fleas after the first few days . We even flea bombed the house and followed up with spraying the carpet and furniture on the chance that we had a flea infestation . Even after the bombing , Frontline Plus continued to give results that I found unacceptable , so I switched to another product . My vet indicated that several clients had the same complaint about Frontline , so it may be that it works well with some animals and not with others , or it stops working for some over time . If it works for you , buying it through Amazon is a bargain , as it is half the cost of buying it through your vet , even adding in shipping costs .	-1
The picture is not what I received . The box I got is frontline but is from a different country . I figure that it is safe to use on my dog but I decided not to since the box is not the same .	-1
I 'm writing this as a long time Frontline Plus customer ( 8 years ) which as of the last year or so has included the generic equivalent.This product keeps ticks from living on your dog . It works great . We 've gone for walks around the lake , only to wake up the next morning and find lots of ticks laying around my dog dead ( they fell off in the night ) , and those are the ones we could n't find and pick off the day earlier.I 've moved to a new home and my dog 's laying around habits have changed . He now favors laying next to the wall in my bedroom and also in my office . I have painted baseboards and thought it was odd they looked streaked , and there was some hair in them . Magic Eraser did n't help much.Fast forward through the winter to spring again . I found it again , yet this time it was fresh ( still softish ) with lots of hair in it and white baseboard paint on my dog 's side - it was the next day after my dog was treated with Frontline Plus . I did some googling and found this has happened with other people , and they 've even had damage to the finish on wood flooring.I 've since stopped using the product , which is unfortunate because it does work well . I recently replaced several carpeted floors with wooden floors and do n't need ugly baseboards AND floors . I purchased a Virbac tick collar , but have n't tried yet .	-1
I have a stray cat who comes in to the bathroom off my garage every night . I got him used to doing this because I was afraid of all the predators in my area . He is perfectly happy there , and I sleep better knowing that he is safe . I have been giving him frontline every month , and every night when he comes in I pick ticks off of him . I am returning the frontline I purchased at the vet because I do n't have money to waste . I have heard that the ticks are become immune to this stuff . I will never use it again ! ! !	-1
My box was definitely genuine because I bought it at Costco . Did NOT get rid of adult fleas and the infestation is as bad or worse as ever . I have to find something that works because my pets are miserable and the house has fleas now too . Too bad these medications are all becoming useless . They used to work so well . Does anyone know which one actually works nowadays . All these meds are way too expensive to fool around with duds . I need something that works and is safe for my dog .	-1
Our vet has recommended that we use this product every 3 weeks as it has not been killing fleas like it used to . Other pet owners we know are having the same problem . It used to be an effective product . Maybe the fleas have built up a tolerance to it . We sure wish it worked better .	-1
When my dog Nikki had fleas . It has n't stopped them . The vet even said that most of these do n't work .	-1
I have used this product in the past with good results , but this time I was less than pleased to say the least . The medication rolled right off the dog and what was left on her did nothing to repell fleas.Then I was left with a dog who is highly alergic to flea bites unprotected and was out $ 30+ to boot.If I had a video camera I 'd upload a picture of all the flea bites on my poor dog 's stomach !	-1
I have used Frontline on my dog for years , but this is the first time that I purchase Frontline Plus . I can not be certain that our problem is a direct result of the Frontline Plus , but my dog developed a growth and open wound at the place where this is applied . I have contacted the company and they were very kind and made a report for their research . However , the dog required medical attention and antibiotics . Just wanted people to be aware to keep an eye on the application site just in case it was a direct result of this product .	-1
This product seemed to work for a couple of weeks at controlling fleas on our indoor dog who only goes out for exercise and to potty . However one morning while combing her I noticed something stuck to her skin and much to my surprise it was a tick ! I thought it was very strange that the tick would be on her and still be alive considering that Frontline specifically states that it is for controlling both fleas and ticks . Moving forward another month and it happened again - another tick . This time I decided that this product just does not stand up to it 's guarantee , nor does it work as advertised . I will not buy again.Have since switched products , and have not experienced the same issue again .	-1
I do n't think this is actually cost effective compared to buying a larger package of this stuff . We carefully followed the package directions and my dog still has fleas.Sorry to give bad news .	-1
Ok So I have used this product for the past two months and it is not working . I do n't know why , it appears to be in the exact same box as the one you would get from your local vet . I know it says it takes at most 18 hours to take affect . Well It has been 10 days since my last application and I just had 3 F****** fleas jump off my little chihuahua and onto me . I am not happy about this at all . I only paid about $ 20 less than what I would have paid at the vets office . WHAT 'S THE DEAL ? ? ? ? Is this S*** fake ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? I do n't usually do reviews if the product is good . but when it is bad I do because I do n't want anyone else wasting their money ! ! ! JUST GO TO YOUR VET TO GET THIS . For some unknown reason this just is n't working and I am frustrated .	-1
I bought this frontline thinking i was getting a good deal plus it was a amazon verified purchase . Got my product and did the application to both my dogs . I did get the green vials , however , the fleas are still here . Went to Merials website and found that they only sell to vets . Never buying this stuff from here again . A few bucks more from a vet insures safety .	-1
This paste gave BOTH my dogs diarrhea each time I used it . It 's also got disgusting fillers . The price is WAY too high for how little use you get out of each can . Just buy a large peanut butter or cream cheese or throw left over chicken in the Kong and freeze it . Why pay this if you can get 20x the use out of a jar of peanut butter ? I only caved because I had been curious for months AND it went on sale .	-1
My new puppy could not be less interested in this treat . Even before mealtime , he just walks away , Not even a sniff . I 've had to resort to pieces of hot dog , and I know that is not healthy for him , so treats are few and far between . Training just has to rely on praise .	-1
This stuff is okay once in a while , but a little too expensive to use instead of the timothy hay . The guinea pigs were n't that thrilled by it .	-1
After reading several articles about Pro Plan and watching the Dog Show tell us how wonderful it is , we tried it for our two critters . At first they appeared to like it , but after a few days they did not take a hankering to it . They stopped eating it about the time they began to show several negative signs of poor health such as diarrhea and lethargy . I am not in a position to say the cause was Pro Plan but putting it away and feeding them another brand appeared to change those conditions . After several days of clean floors , rugs etc. , we decided for the sake of our prizes we would chunk the dog food.While they were eating Pro Plan the dogs ( one is 14.5 years and the other is 10 months old ) we saw a world of change . The old boy just did little to nothing which is about like me but worse . The youngster was almost the same which is almost a complete opposite of her normal puppy personality . Wit no Pro Plan the old dog will act as if he is not old and almost like a youngster and the young one has reverted to her old self . I hate to lose the money ; however , I will not let a few bucks ruin our prizes . They did not win any prizes except for our hearts .	-1
My older cat has eaten this chicken and herring recipe in several can sizes . Until recently , they have all been the same . Lately , there is liquid ( water ? ) floating all through the food . If you had n't asked , I would have waited a bit longer to mention this.The delivery is on schedule , or sometimes a bit ahead of promised date . I am overall satisfied with the product . We 'll see if the runny consistency is typical . If not , I will edit this review.UPDATE : 6/1/14 . I ca n't delay to see what is in the 2nd flat . I have finally decided that , after cleaning up cat vomit time and again , I am donating a flat and a half of this chicken and Herring recipe in the big can to a rescue shelter . Poor kitties -- hope they can tolerate it.Also , I have decided not to buy pet food from Amazon because , if it is unsatisfactory , it is too troublesome to return it . I have run into bent cans and in this batch , watery and apparently not acceptable taste . One cat consistently threw it up and the younger one rejected it..	-1
Since my6 cat wo n't eat it , I give it to some of the feral cats I feed as a treat from time to time . It 's too expensive to feed it to the feral cats all the time .	-1
My cats enjoy eating Wellness Chicken and Herring ( they did n't like the turkey ) . I like giving them a high quality food . But when I ordered a case several of the cans were badly dented so I did not use them . Not from shipping , because the dented cans were not on the outside of the pack but on the inside which means someone deliberately packed dented cans . This defeated my goal of saving money by ordering online . It is better for me to buy them from the store so I can be sure the cans are n't damaged .	-1
My cats have been eating Welness chicken recipe for quite some time . For some reason , the chicken was not available , so I tried a couple of other flavors . They hated this one . I ended up giving it away .	-1
Yes , I tasted them - they taste like chemicals but I guess that 's what you should expect from a joint supplement . My Shih tzu & Pekingese would not eat them .	-1
One of my dogs is picky , so I 'm not surprised there , but the other will eat anything and she still wo n't touch this ! Very disappointed .	-1
I 'll rate it only 3 stars . This is why ... I got these treats for my dysplastic Lab mix puppy ( not severe , and thought these might help ) AND my 10 year old GSD mix , who is moderately arthritic.NEITHER dog liked the treats . The puppy took the treat , fiddled it around in his mouth a bit , then spit it out and stared at it . The old dog sniffed the treat , but refused to touch it . She sniffed it and her head shook and a pure look of `` disgust '' went on her face and she walked off.When I opened the bag , this horrible medicinal smell came out , and honestly ... the treats even LOOK like medicine . Brown and boring . I think the beneficial supplements in these treats repulse some dogs or something . I have no idea.I was able to convince the puppy to eat the `` treat '' but the old dog would NOT eat it . I tried to hide it in some sandwich meat , no go . Tried to use some cheese , no go . So , this treat wo n't be able to help the old dog as she wo n't touch it , which automatically knocks down the treats rating.The rating will go up if this seems to help my puppy , but the taste of them is in question because neither of my dogs like it . The Lab mix puppy is very greedy ( as are all Labs/Lab mixes ) so he finally ate it . I 'm not sure how people are saying their dogs love these treats , neither of my dogs were fond of them ... .August 29th . Treats are now gone . Nigredo ( the puppy ) picked at them each and every day . Jade , the dog that they were truly for would n't touch them , absolutely hated them . Could never get her to eat even one . See no improvement in the puppy , but as it 's dysplasia ... did n't expect much . Reviews goes down to 2 stars . Did n't help me at all !	-1
My dogs loved the taste , but two out of four dogs got diarrhea the next day.I do n't know why , but I could n't give it again .	-1
That was before they sold out to Nestle Purina . We all know what happens to companies who sell out to mega corps - the quality suffers , they start out saying everything will remain in house under watchful eyes - that never happens . Already Nestle Purina has brought in their own management team . The ingredients will probably start becoming imported from china ! The very reason Zukes came in to existence was has a quality option for pet parents who do n't want to buy into the mega corp crap . Zukes will NEVER be welcome into my house again . Ever . Nestle Purina - makers of Waggin Train and Canyon Creek Ranch - that crap killed hundreds of dogs starting in 2010 when Nestle Purina bought that company . NEVER . Again .	-1
I 've got the typical middle age aches , so I was hoping that Zyflamend progam would help me not creak as much . Unfortunately , no results . Nothing at all.I followed the instructions on the insert and built up to 2 pills/day . The instructions have you do this so your stomach can adjust to the `` spiciness '' . My stomach did n't mind the pills , so I can not comment on this potential side effect . However , the pills are LARGE - 2.2 cm long & .7 cm wide ( over `` long & over `` wide ) & they are pungent , so be warned.Herbs and individual manufacturers ' formulations are not regulated by the FDA . Statements regarding efficacy and safety are generated by the manufacturer . I tried to research the `` medical '' claims made by the manufacturer before I started taking Zyflamend , and found that the claims are a bit exaggerated . The `` clinically tested '' claim seems to come from Columbia University research on normal cell growth & prostates . MD Anderson Cancer Center is also mentioned but I could not find outside corroboration . The product insert states `` In April 2003 , research was presented on a comprehensive New Chapter program , including Zyflamend , which significantly reduced fatigue associated with chemotherapy '' , but there was no indicator about who presented such research and where the research was presented.This is a type of product that is highly subjective , so what does n't work for me may work for others ; only a trial will tell .	-1
My joints creak a bit with middle age , and I get stiff sitting too long or even walking a far piece . This stuff would be great if it helped the joint inflammation , even a little . I followed directions , only had one a day to start with meals , and I see why . This stuff burns down there in the gut you can seriously feel the flame . Now , I like to give it a fair chance , but especially when I went to two a days , and after about half the bottle was used up , I felt no benefits . So why I want to give myself psuedo-indigestion twice a day would be beyond me.Hotwings lovers , Thai food fans , spicey food fellows of all races and creeds , this may be for you . I 'm a dyed in the wool spice hater who will shy away from all things spicey anyway . This may not be a fair review from that regard , but I see no health benefits from this stuff , at least in the short term . Unless you salivate when you hear the phrase `` buffalo wings '' , I doubt the non-hot fan will tolerate pain in the tummy long enough to realize any long-term benefits .	-1
Was not pleased with this product so I sent it back . This was the first time that I ever sent anything back .	-1
I am a runner and every day exerciser . I liked the idea of the Zyflamend and when it was offered to me through the Vine program I jumped to get it . Well , I have been taking it for just about a week now , and I can tell you that I have not derived any benefit from this with the exception of some really bad stomach and intestinal troubles . I am not sure what is causing it . From looking at the ingredients , it looks like a lot of the stuff I already have in my spice cabinet ( oregano ? ) , but there is something in here which does not agree with my digestive system . So , after a week of taking it , I am done . Thought I would develop a tolerance , but it never happened no matter what I did ( eating or not eating before or after taking it did n't make a difference either ) . Maybe it 's just me , so I am rating it a two star instead of a one star .	-1
Purchased these for Mother with osteoarthritis and other maladies . She says she still feels the same after taking these pills for over a month . Absolutely NO difference , do n't buy , NOT recommended at all ! Keep your money !	-1
I have a 7 year old Maltese , and a nine month old miniature schnauzer . The size of these treats was fine for them , and after some initial reluctance at the unusual flavors ( pizza and cheese , with chicken and beef being the normal flavors ) the dogs seemed to like them . However , the day after I began feeding them Scooby Snacks the Maltese began throwing up , and the Schnauzer had alarming , unnaturally colored diarrhea . It did not immediately occur to me that it might be the treats , but the next day when the symptoms continued I stopped feeding them treats altogether and all upset ceased . Nobody else seems to have had this problem , perhaps I simply got a bad batch , but I am not willing to try these again .	-1
I bought this dog food because the bag showed pictured of veggies and chunks of meat , and with a name like `` Beneful '' I thought I was purchasing a nutritious brand of dog food . My dogs did eat this food at first , and slowly began to not like it . After reading the ingredients I completely regret purchasing it and feel just awful for feeding it to my dogs . The first three ingredients are Ground yellow corn , chicken by-product meal , and corn gluten meal . How disgusting is that ? ! The main ingredient is a corn filler . One thing my vet told me a while back that I never forgot : `` When you eat corn , what comes out of the other end ? The same thing happens with dogs . '' Basically , dogs can not fully digest corn as they are carnivores . Corn it is just a cheap filler that can cause dogs to actually eat more to feel full , poop out more , and retain less nutrients . Most inexpensive low-quality pet foods have lots of these fillers and cheap ingredients with little to no nutritional value.The only meat in Beneful at all is a by-product , its not even a real meat ! By-products are the stuff leftover once all the actual meat is harvested . We 're talking beaks , chicken feet , eyeballs , even chicken poop ! I would not recommend this product to anyone , for any reason , ever . It is an absolutely awful dog food . I ca n't believe the pictures of veggies and full chunks of meat on the bag can be allowed to be on the packaging if the product does not contain the pictured items ; it is very misleading and should be considered false advertising.I recommend to stay far away from Beneful , and most Purina products . When purchasing a dog ( or cat ) food , the most important thing to consider is the first 3 ingredients ; just make sure those first three are decent ingredients that you would eat yourself- provided that you eat a typical ( non vegetarian or other restricted ) diet . Now that I know what to look for , I usually buy my pets all natural foods such as Natural Balance , Blue Buffalo , Halo , or Wellness . High-quality foods tend to be more nutritionally dense , meaning you will be feeding a much smaller amount for the same number of calories . If you do the math to figure out the cost for the number of calories you need to feed your pet , many premium foods are CHEAPER than the awful crap you 're buying at the grocery store .	-1
I 've used Pet Tab vitamins in the past , but have recently been disappointed to find that many of them are produced in India or outside the U.S. Vetri-Science products seem to be of good quality and reasonably priced , so I thought I 'd try these when I ran out of my Pet Tabs . Unfortunately , the dogs do n't seem to care for them . My older dog spits them out even with peanut butter on them . Once my puppy finishes these , I 'll not re-purchase since they do n't readily eat them .	-1
I have two dogs one is Cockapoo another is Shiba Inu . Those peals gave both my dogs terrible diarrhea . I would not recommend it .	-1
My dog loved the original Purina One Adult Chicken with Rice Dog Food . However , since Purina developed the smart-blend , she wo n't eat it unless I add some turkey . The tan color pieces are awful - kind of rubbery . I went back to buying the regular Purina Chicken and Rice Mix where all the morsels are pretty much the same in size and color . My dog really likes the older version much better . I wo n't be buying the blend mixture again . Sometimes , change is n't better .	-1
This stuff is mostly corn and grain filler that 's not good for cats . But at least the first ingredient is chicken , although there are meat by-products also . There are much healthier choices like Innova EVO , Felidae , Natural Balance , etc .	-1
Two weeks to deliver is outrageous . Still do n't have it , this bag has more stops and miles on it than a bird going south . What the heck is going on ?	-1
The cats enjoyed it for about five minutes because it was new . Now that the novelty has worn off , they could care less . So , given the big price of this product , I 'll not refill .	-1
OMG , I have never smelled any pet food , wet or dry , that has the overwhelming awful stench that this product does . It smells much worse even than the smell when I feed my cats a can of mackerel . Unbelievably , the product smells like a combination of strong horse manure and dead rotting carcasses . It 's appalling , I 'm not exaggerating . I was nearly bowled over when I opened the vacuum sealed package . However , I assumed that the stench was attributable to the package having been sealed , and that it would dissipate . Unfortunately it did n't dissipate in a positive way ; it did stink up the three contiguous rooms where I feed the cats . I had to spray all the rooms with a very high quality ( and usually effective ) natural citrus deodorizing spray four times , and it still smells like someone threw a dead horse into a dumpster in the desert and left it there for a month . Oh , and I also have a large air filter , an air filtering air conditioner , AND a special odor absorbing product in the same room that I initially put the cat food in.I would strongly urge anyone considering using this pet food to try to find a sample size at a pet store first ! Perhaps there is some fluke with the package I got ; but based upon the smell , I 'm not convinced that this is a good thing to feed a cat . The strong manure smell is just particularly weird coming from a pet food .	-1
This is a can of over-priced air-filled peanut butter that fills a puppy KONG only 5 times and easy for the dog to devour in seconds . It 's not the healthiest stuff in the world either .	-1
My puppy Paw Paw hates this stuff.And I hate it to . It get 's my whole house plus the inside of the toy stink . And my next door neighboor dog Fluffy the Bichon frise ate this stuff one time and ended up in the emergenciey room ! But she is better but needs to rest for a couple days .	-1
Let 's get one thing straight first : dogs love this stuff . I mean they REALLY LOVE IT . Not just my puppy , but every dog in my office - the second this stuff comes out , my desk is surrounded by noses that smelled it from across the office . And they want it so bad they 'll watch wistfully as my puppy devours it , just a little bit , from his Kong . When he 's done , they get in line to steal the Kong and the lucky one will spend several minutes working on it just in case there 's any left.By the end of the afternoon , I am choking on the odor that rises at regular intervals from under my desk in nearly visible clouds of pure dog fart stench . By the time we get home , even the puppy will stop in his tracks every few minutes and startle at his own rear end , not entirely sure what 's going on back there but knowing it 's probably not good . By the end of the evening I am swearing to myself once again that tomorrow , no matter how desperate I am to occupy him and get some work done , I wo n't give this stuff to the puppy and turn him into a 6.5lb tactical nuke.I think today was the last time he 'll be getting it , and the rest of the can is going in the trash . It 's just not worth it ! ( editing 3 years later ! btw , things that are great for keeping puppies/dogs busy - grass-fed buffalo ears from Petflow ( they 're cheap ! ) . Fill the Kong with canned cat or dog food , freeze it , and then give it to them ( just remember to cut back on their regular food by an equivalent amount or you 'll soon have a roly poly puppy ) . Or for something lower calorie , fill these with low-sodium chicken broth : Set of 2 - Easy Push Out - Ice Cube Tray w/Flexible Rubber Bottom Round shape freeze them , and pop them in the smaller Kongs ( they fit perfectly ) . You can freeze the cat/dog food in them in advance too and put them in the Kongs whenever needed . Have fun with your puppy . : )	-1
My puppy does n't like Kong products . I gave the product away to a friend that has dogs . Next time I will buy one product and try it on my dog before buying multiple products based on the name brand .	-1
If you puppy or dog likes to play rough with the toys -- as they might do with another puppy -- do not buy this toy . Mine is a very small dog and was able to tear this toy apart and I caught him before he ate part of the squeaker.I had thought highly of Kygen toys and bought several . Now I will reconsider .	-1
The junior sized hedge hog does not honk like the one in the video . Waste of five bucks as I have plenty of toys that make regular squeaks . At first i thought it was defective so i returned for an exchange but it was the same deal with the new one . Also , where is the rattle as said in the description ?	-1
Bought this for my Rottweiler and she destroyed it the first day . We had bought her another one from Lowes and it held up much better !	-1
I typically get the go dog toys with chew guard . This got such great reviews I wanted to try it . With in two minutes half the face had been eaten and a squeaker was out , this is dangerous , do n't know if it was defective or not but will contact the seller .	-1
I have bought so many of these and each one & # 34 ; dies & # 34 ; sooner and sooner . After the last two lived less than 15 minutes , I have said good-bye to this product . For how much he gets to enjoy it before destroying it and having it taken away , I could buy him a doggie-massage for less money . At least that would last an hour.Kyjen , if you are reading this , worry less about making it looking like a real animal . Get rid of some of the weak points that draw attention and lead to destruction . My dog does n't need you to hand him a pointy nose to pull on or tiny , un-reinforced little feet to chew in .	-1
Appealing looking toy . It did however hold up to the challenge of surviving our dog . She had it apart very quickly .	-1
The fence is incredibly inconsistent . It will shock my dog at different distances , sometimes it wo n't shock at all , sometimes it will beep , sometimes it does n't beep and only shocks him . It 's impossible to train him properly when the fence is not consistent . I also tried this shock collar on my hand and it left my two fingers slightly numb for about 3 hours . This is not as small of a shock as I expected . I saw my dog shaking whenever I was trying to put the collar on him the last time and decided to just return it because it 's just that awful .	-1
Bought this for my German Shepherd dog and he wo n't touch it . It 's been sitting here for weeks and we 've tried many times to make it appealing through play/encouragement/even slathering with peanut butter to no avail . Big waste of money . He likes rawhide much better . Still looking for a safer , lower-calorie alternative to bones and sticks that provides chewing pleasure .	-1
I gave this two stars because my puppy really liked this ... BUT , I wish I would have read a couple of these reviews before I bought it ... some said they would n't recommend it for strong chewers ... My German Shepherd puppy chewed little pieces off of it and was eating it ! I have several other nylabones but they are n't flavored so she does n't chew them as aggressively ... yet .	-1
I thought the Nylabone would be a good thing for my Border Collie , since he likes to have a little something to gnaw on once in a while , and the product is advertised as safe and healthy . He likes chewing on these , but he is able to chew off large pieces of the bone - about 1/4 to 1/2 inch diameter chunks . He swallows them , then coughs , sounds like he 's choking , and vomits the pieces up later . I do n't feel safe giving him these .	-1
This dish is too deep for cats but what really annoyed me was the 45 minutes I spent trying to get the label off . I tried peeling it off , using soap and water , then Goo-gone , and then Goof-off . I scraped and rubbed and there is still a ton of adhesive stuck to the side of the frame . Now there 's cat hair stuck to the adhesive . Lastly , when you lift the feeder up you have to make sure you hold it by the frame , otherwise the bowls pop out onto the floor . I threw it in the trash after about a week .	-1
I used this for a couple months and ended up buying another product because of a couple issues with this one.- The bowls come with a sticker on them holding them in place . It 's impossible to get it off without leaving some residue so you end up with a dirty spot in each bowl and one side of the holder has a big sticky area on it.- If the water is in the bowl for more than a day it gets a chemical smell/taste to it which I ca n't imagine is good for my pets- It 's not attractive looking	-1
We had this bowl for a month and then my dog literally ate the middle section of this bowl and lost one of the cups ... I 'm mildly concerned when she will be pooping out the plastic ... .	-1
I have tried every type of low ph food for one of our cats , and of all I have tried , this is the one she absolutely refuses to eat . Even tried mixing it with her other low ph food which she will eat , but no dice . So if your cat is a finicky eater , you may need to pass on this one .	-1
I had high hopes for this food . I have two cats with kidney issues . As it turns out , none of the cats will eat it . Too bad . It was a good price .	-1
I fed her one of the cans one evening and the next day my poor little cat had nonstop diarrhea and vomiting throughout the day . I noticed that where she had eaten into the food , there was a a half inch round spot in the middle of it that was unnaturally black looking . On closer inspection , the spot ran about an inch deep into the remainder of the uneaten food . Yikes . I 'm glad she survived it , but I 'll probably never trust internet cat food again .	-1
poor ingredients , poor taste . junk food for cats . neither cat will touch this food even if mixed with other food . I did not even bother to donate it to the animal shelter , why torture other cats ?	-1
Contains fish and made my ckd cat sicker . lots of diarrhea to clean up : / one thing i learned from my online researching for kidney diseased cats ; do not give them fish especially for older cats 12+ . This product is inexpensive for a reason i guess .	-1
I 'm not really sure what I was thinking when I bought this food , except that I was freaking out about my cat being diagnosed with chronic renal failure . The ingredients in this food are really not something I would normally even consider feeding to our cats , but like I said , I was freaking out ! Usually cats like crappy canned food , so I figured , what the hell and opened a can . Not only did our chronic renal failure cat turn his nose up , but so did the other 3 cats . Oh , well ! I 'm sure it 's better than any of Hill 's Science Diet products , Purina anything , or Royal Canin 's prescription diet , but not by very much .	-1
My puppy is teething so I had previously purchased the original Nylabone made out of flavored plastic . The dog loved it , not super excited about the regular bone but she did put a lot of work into destroying it . When she finally finished the original plastic bone I decided to go back to the store and grab some more . I was looking around and came across these , `` natural , '' flavored bones and thought ... . `` SWEET ! ! ! Same great bone but easier to digest ! '' How wrong I was . First off this is NOTHING like the plastic teething bones . They crumble easily ... and by easily I mean my 3.5 month old Wheaten Terrier destroyed these in less than 30min , and she 's only about 15 pounds right now . They are recommended for dogs 6 months + with pretty much a full set of permanent teeth because they can shred the bone more easily and to a finer debris . For my dog this was BS ... she destroyed these into tiny little flakes that can be easily digested AND managed to get them all over her underbelly and tangled in her fur . The mess was n't an issue.. the durability was . This is basically an expensive treat , I much rather give her bullysticks over this as a treat ( and they last longer ) . If your dog is teething , this is def NOT the Nylabone version you want . Stick to the original plastic flavored bones or frozen towels . Both work great .	-1
We have a cattle dog mix . After she had one of these , I saw it in large chunks in her stool . That explained some of her painful sounds prior to that . I 'm sorry I gave it to her . Please be careful about these .	-1
I am a big fan of treats that are digestable . I purchased this product thinking it would be safe to feed my dog . I left the treat for my dog on my way out the door for work , when I arrived home 4 hours later the treat was fully gone and the poor dog could not control his bowel movements and had diarrhea.This diarreha lasted for 2 days , and was so bad that I had to take a trip to the vet which ended up being one of the most expensive trips I 've made there yet to have him tested for various illnesses.I did n't attribute the diarrhea to the product at first , but a week later I again gave my dog this bone treat and a few hours after eating the bone the diarrhea started back up again.I 'm unsure what exactly about this product is `` healthy '' , and would argue against it being `` edible '' . Sure technically you can give this product to your dog and if he eats peices it wo n't require surgery to remove . But you 'll spend 2-3 days dealing with uncontrolable doggy bowel movements , and excessive dehydration . And if your not quick enough to realize it 's this treat causing your problems you 'll spend a few hundred bucks at the vets office like I did.And do n't get me started on how quickly these things can get eaten ... .From now on I 'll stick with bully sticks .	-1
Seriously ? ? By whose standards ? ? Since when are wheat starch , glycerin , cellulose , potato starch , bacon flavor ( ? what does this mean ? ) healthy ? I bought this thinking it would last a few hours or days but my dog just gobbled it up in minutes.I love the nylabone chew products but I do n't recommend these unless you have very large dogs that can eat them as treats .	-1
This is not worth it . My pit ate it in large chunks in under a minute . i bought it locally for what i 'd pay for dinner- not worth it in terms of money or time in keeping him busy . he takes longer to eat an entire bowl of food..	-1
First let me say that all three of my dogs love these . They are not very aggressive chewers , but these only lasted a matter of minutes with each one of them . For this price , I expected a toy/treat that would last much longer . Save your money and buy a box of milk bones .	-1
This little sponge does pick up dog hairs but not a lot at once . You have to go over and over the surface you are cleaning and remove the hair from the sponge as you go along . The vacuum cleaner works much better , as do other gadgets I 've purchased at Walmart and the supermarket , such as sticky surface cleaners that attract hair or fuzzy surface cleaners that do the same . I do not recommend this product because it is too slow .	-1
Was expecting more with the high price but my dog barely touched this , and when he did eat it he would have food allergies	-1
Ingredients and reviews look good . However , this is the first time I 've ever found mold in my dog food . I have a specific container that I put my dog food in so it does n't get any moisture . It 's even air tight . This could be the best dog food out there , but if the quality control is bad , I wo n't be buying it . I 'll add pictures of the mold or whatever is growing on the dog food.Update : So when I placed my initial order , there were two bags . The first bag had the stated problem and was tossed but I did n't have any other dog food on me at the time so I went ahead and opened the second bag . I kept a closer eye on it this time and it 's been close to two months and I 've not had any problems . My dog 's fur seems to be in good shape and he 's very active . Because of the horrible experience with the first bag , I still have to give this product a low rating and will stick with other brands . If there 's not QC issues though , this would be a very good brand to try .	-1
I 've never used this product before , but had a coupon so thought it would be worth trying , I looked at their site and checked to make sure that the protein was still adequate ( which was 28 % ) , when I got to the store , they received new bags , which is now only 22 % protein , which is not enough meat to grain ratio . Theres better options on the merket , they make cost little more , but at least you 're not getting jipped .	-1
My dogs do not like this ball . They like the holee roller . It is easier for them to get their teeth in . This ball is hard to get the dirt out of and their teeth . Do not recommend .	-1
I purchased this pet feeder because you can control how much food your pet gets . I have a cat that will just eat and eat until he throws up . I have the Bistro pet feeder which works really well but the minimum feeding is 1/4 cup which is too much for my cat at one time . I have to feed only a few cat food pieces at a time several times a day.This feeder is much better if you need to control how much your pet eats at one time . After figuring out the timer and through trial and error ( user error ) , I have my cat fed on schedule with no chance of him overeating.There are 8 separate settings for the timer so you can use all 8 settings every day or whatever you decide to feed your pet . The food comes out for the amount of seconds , or minutes you set it for.Seems to be solidly built and I 've had no issues with it so far . It 's worked flawlessly.It 's pricy but for my cat and his eating issues , it 's worth the money to keep me from cleaning up after him every single morning when he overeats.October 9 , 2013I have had this feeder now for 5 mos and I 'm still very happy with it . I have noticed one problem that is annoying . Some of the food that drops out at the specified time , does n't slide all the way down and ends up under the spout that drops the food . It 's the design . It needs more gravity to slide down all the way . I 'm constantly scooping the food from under the spout area . I might try to rig up some tube or something to carry the food all the way down to the dish . Other than that , it 's really saved my sanity.October 23 , 2013Guess I spoke too soon . Today the feeder just stopped working completely . Just hums when the food should be dispensed . I emptied the food out thinking it was clogged , but it 's not . It 's completely empty and cleaned out but still does n't work . Just keeps humming and the wheel barely moves that dispenses the food . I 'm so bummed . I am calling the company tomorrow to see if they 'll take it back . I 'll update after.Dec . 18 , 2013I called the company that makes this feeder and they sent out a new base right away . However , the auger moved so slowly that by the time it started dropping food , the timer ran out . It would only get 4-5 pieces out . I increased the time and it did n't make much of a difference . Also the food still gets bunched up under the spout so my cats ca n't get to it . I called the company back and they 're sending out another new base . I did ask if it was refurbished and he said no , they are brand new and I must have gotten a defective one . I must say their customer service is excellent . I give their CS 5 stars . But we 'll see how the replacement is when I receive it .	-1
I received this as a gift from my mother in January 2014 because I was having issued related to feeding my cats . The most central problem was that my cats were constantly bothering me starting around 3am and begging to be fed ... so using the automatic feeder , I could assure that the cats were being feed and that I was not losing my sanity . Additionally , having two overweight kitties ( 14-15 lbs ) , I found that after reading the instruction manual in regards to how to use timer to measure out feedings , 1 . I could spread out the meals much better over the day to prevent them from gorging on food , and 2 . I thought I was feeding them 1/2 cup per cat per day , turns out it was more ... over the 6 months I used the feeder , they lost a combined 3 pounds.However , I have to give the feeder a lower rating because of the circumstances related to how the feeder seemed to mysteriously stop working . After using the feeder for about 6 months , I woke up one morning to two hysterical cats . Upon examination , it was clear that at least the timer had malfunctioned ... I reset and reset it , as well as tried it on all settings to no avail , no kibbles came out . I did n't note any obvious problems with the feeder itself . I trialed it again with a different timer ( essentially the same timer that comes with the feeder minus the seconds option ) , and noted right away that the timer was putting out the kibbles at a much , much slower rate , e.g . 1 kibble every 2-3 seconds . After moving some of the kibble , I could see right away that the motor was barely moving . In case there was some other issue in the feeder , I decided to clean the feeder and found no clear problems ( although one very small , 1 cm piece of plastic that had broken off from somewhere in the feeder ) . Based on what other reviewers have mentioned , it is clear that the manufacturer has nothing constructive to contribute in terms of fixing the feeder . I 'm going to look elsewhere , though I have to say how disappointed I am that it suddenly died and the loss of the money invested in this feeder .	-1
I have ( 6 ) dogs so getting a feeder that contains a bag of food and dispenses at timed intervals that I set made sense . Unfortunately , the feeder does not work as designed . When the timer goes off a heavy cable at the bottom of the feeder circulates thru the container to stir up the food , loosen it up and drop into the feeding bowl . But the cable would circulate and nothing would fall into the dish . I tried different size dried food but it still wo n't dispense any food . I looked for clogs but soon realized the cap was preventing food from entering , it either wo n't open or does not open enough . You would also need to keep this tank at least 1/2 full for it to sometimes work . Finally I have resorted to using it as a storage bin for the food . I scoop the food out myself and put it in the bowl . The large cable that plugs into the wall is unsightly ! The design/idea is solid , the actual successful operation is flawed .	-1
this thing is a waste of time.. first of all the instructions are not even close to how to work it , . .. after getting the timer to work ( things like see page 6 ... there IS no page 6 ) ... when plugged in all it did was give food constantly.. timer be damned.. its a horrid waste of two days ... huge piece of junk.. DONT bother.. ( the ergo water dispenser however we like ) ..	-1
I purchased this as a storage container for my dry dog food . Unfortunately , when I removed it from the box , one of the wheels was already broken and the exterior of the container was scratched like it had been used for months prior to its arrival . I honestly would have been ok with the scratches but I had to send it back because I could not fix the wheel . I was apprehensive about buying another one online , so I did n't and instead I chose buy a different one from one of the big box stores in our area .	-1
The specifications state ( 15 x 17.9 x 22.2 inches ) . With the wheels , it measures 24.25 in height . Of course it will not slide into my pantry at that height.Now I either place it outside in an unsightly plain-view position or drag it in and out of the pantry . I will bet in a few months that the unit breaks after pushing and pulling since the plastic is sort of brittle . The corners of the wheels are flimsy and not engineered well enough for the added stress of daily maneuvering where the wheels attach to the unit.Seriously , pass this if you are on the bubble of a decision .	-1
This product serves its purpose . It cleans the blades well . However , I would rather have the 3 in 1 product that lubricates , cleans , and cools . It is virtually the same price and serves 3 purposes . It is also made by Oster . Check that one out instead .	-1
Worked great for three weeks then cat just stopped responding . Had to contact vet again and she put him on steroid eye drops to put in his nose . Problem solved . Kitten happy . Had to do the vet drops for one month . Now only use when he gets a sneezing fit and it is nipped before he gets sinus clog and infection . Had multiple vets recommend useless remedies and medications . The drops are neomycin polymyxin and dexamethasone in ophthalmic suspension . It is manufactured by Sandoz and is prescription only . Comes in tiny bottle . It took three years three vets and over twelve hundred dollars spent before success . Hope this helps and saves you a thousand dollars .	-1
Based on the positive reviews , I purchased this product to deal with my cats sinus issues . His nose is constantly blocked up , he snores all the time and breathes through his mouth . He also has excessive nasal discharge . After bringing him to the veterinarian several times and putting him on a regimen of antibiotics , I decided to try out this product , as none of the other treatments provided any relief . While this product did n't make his condition any worse , it did n't do anything to make it better . I guess it all depends on your particular pet , but for mine the product was useless .	-1
Was hard to keep it filled and my puppy didnt like to play with it for some reason , she liked the other ball they have the dental one much better . One plus..it bounces good .	-1
THERE IS THE HOLE TO PUT THE TREATS IN BUT THE HOLE IS SO BIG THAT THEY FALL BACK OUT ! !	-1
The holes are WAY too big in this . NOTHING will stay in it for even a second . It 's ok as a plain ball to play with , but you can get balls much cheaper .	-1
Not an awful product . Holes were mostly too big to put anything in , food comes out too easily . Meaning dog is bored with it after a few seconds . Not bad , I suppose , but did n't do much for my dog .	-1
My 27 lb Miniature Poodle mix has already taken a couple big chunks out of this ... .I was expecting better from a KONG product , I 'm very disappointed and so is pup ! It lasted only 7 or 8 days before I had to throw it out because he tore into the ball so easily .	-1
dogs able to chew pieces off within an hour of giving them the toy . Expected more from Kong products . other kongs products have been great , this one = not so much . bummer .	-1
We have an English Bulldog and I have been struggling to find something he can not destroy within a few days . This toy was destroyed within a week . Not to say it is a bad toy , it is probably good for a less aggressive chewer .	-1
I 've been using hydrometers for over 35 years . This one would give me three different readings in three different attempts to check specific gravity in my aquarium . Screwed up my salt levels in the tank by trusting this . Corals are very unhappy .	-1
After reading the instructions , keeping it rinse with regular water after use and discarding the first test each time I use it my readings still will not go past 1.016 ! This is even after adding more salt to the aquarium to bring it up to the 1.025 I need . Now I have no way of know what my salinity is until I purchase a refractometer for more accurate results which also puts a delay on me adding any inhabitants to the tank.I even gave it a second chance , I actually purchased saltwater from my local fish store which is pre-mixed at a salinity of 1.025 . When I did a test on it ... still got 1.016 . Needless to say I will be throwing this item away .	-1
keep it clean and i would say it works if rite from factory . I have . deep 6 hydrometers that are 15 years old maybe older that still work well . That 's 5 star in my book as long as its accurate when new keep it clean with fresh water and look close for air bubbles ... i have had 4 Instant Ocean SeaTest Hydrometer that the counter weight fell out with no way to fix and 3 instant ocean testers that did n't work at all ThoseFishGeeks . comCounter weight falls out	-1
Bought this to test the water in my marine aquarium . It 's way off ! Said the specific gravity was 1.022 when it was actually a extreme low 1.015 . Lucky for me it 's a new set up and no fish yet or else I 'd be out a lot more money for sure . And yes I rinsed very well before and after use .	-1
Purchased this for my new saltwater tank . Very simple readings and accurate ! I am a Lab technologist and have tested this alongside our own methods of testing body fluids and they are nearly identical ! Not bad comparing five bucks to five hundred in terms of equipment ! great buyEDIT ! ! ! BROKE WITHIN 2 MONTHS ! ! ! JUNK . The center piece holding the meter fell out and thus rendering it useless . Save your money for a refractometer ! These are garbage	-1
I had an oceanic hydrometer for nano tanks that was meant to stay in the tank at all times ( it had little suction cups on it so it was always facing the outside of the tank . I was getting high readings from it all the time , even when i would mix the appropriate salt/water mix stated in the directions to achieve a specific gravity of 1.024 . I thought the hydrometer was off , so I ordered this one . I use a lot of Instant ocean products and expected this to be of the same quality of their other products . It consistently reads low salt content , while the other one i have reads high . I literally mixed a gallon of water with 1/2 cup salt so i knew that the salinity would be 1.024 , and marked with a pen where 1.024 was , not where it said it was . I am disappointed and am buying a refractometer instead of another hydrometer . The ones that are both a hydrometer and thermometer are a joke too ... do n't waste your time on those either .	-1
This is a useless piece of crap . It is not accurate and my fish specialist threw it out . The product you need to test salt water is this : Salinity Refractometer Aquarium Seawater AgricultureI never came across a product that was this bad .	-1
this product is useless simply because i think for it to work you need to place at least a dozen of them for a very small yardmost of us does not have that kind of money to waste	-1
My dog hears the nosie , very disappointing in this item .	-1
I ordered this thing about a month ago and STILL have n't received it . My credit card has been charged and I received a `` we 're looking into it '' email several weeks ago . Basically they took my money and gave me no product . To say I 'm annoyed would be the understatement of the century .	-1
I have been using Arm & Hammer for some time but , this litter does not do the job . My whole house smells like the litter boxes that we have.I am so embarrassed by this , I will not let my friends or family stop by my home.i am really disappointed in this product of the Arm & Hammer line . I will not be buying this again , ever .	-1
One of my cats has a urinary tract condition and my vet suggested using an unscented clumping litter as one of several strategies to make things easier on the cat . Arm & Hammer Super Scoop was the first one I tried . I gave it a good run ( probably six months ) but had to give up.Let me tell you a little bit about the way I use kitty litter so you can judge for yourself whether this product will work for you . I have four cats and four litter boxes . Naturally , all the cats want to & # 34 ; go & # 34 ; in the same box , but that 's beside the point . I use 3 or 4 20-lb boxes of kitty litter to fill the boxes after I scrub them . I scoop regularly until the level of litter in the box is low . Then I 'll top off with another 20-lb box . When the litter gets low a second time , I go ahead and do a full cleaning . This process usually completes itself on the order of 3-5 weeks , with my cats.I did not find the Arm & Hammer to be too dusty , and I did not find it to have a scent ( which is good , since it 's supposedly unscented ) . And for the first couple of months , it was serviceable . But I noticed a change in the quality a couple of months in , and it never did resolve itself . I do n't know if they changed the formula or I got multiple bad batches in a row , or what , but the performance of the litter took a turn for the worse and never improved.What happened was my house started smelling like cat urine , whereas it never had before ( following the exact same procedure outlined in an earlier paragraph ) . At about the same time , I noticed that the litter stopped clumping after awhile or , occasionally , the clumps would break apart when I scooped ( into pieces small enough that a normal scooper would n't actually catch them ) . So every time I scooped , I was essentially spreading the urine litter all around , rather than removing it . At first , this only happened after I did the refill ( as described above ) , but later , it started happening even with freshly-cleaned boxes . The odor control capabilities of the Arm & Hammer litter were lasting a very short time , and I eventually had to give up on using it all together , as it was just not economical to buy 80 pounds of the stuff every week.Note : If anyone has tried this recently , since I have n't used it in over a year , and has noticed that the quality has improved , please let me know . I 'm finding my favorite Fresh Step is becoming increasingly hard to find and am willing to give this another chance .	-1
Reviewing the Peach , Passionfruit , and Mango Flavor : 500 mg vitamin C as sodium ascorbate and ascorbic acid . I thought the flavors would be separate , but they 're not- one pale color , and flavors blended into one . The taste is OK , and easy enough to chew through , and I wo n't throw them away . I probably wo n't reorder.Ca n't review separately once doing a review on one- SO : Blueberry , Raspberry , and Boysenberry Flavor- same vitamin C content and sources . Reminds me of the smell of fish food flakes- absolutely DISGUSTING , when expecting normally tasty berry flavors . Maybe the red cabbage that they use to color the tablets is what does it . I wo n't be able to choke these down . Wasted money . Really disgusting . I usually love anything berry flavored . Oy . Would make a good puke inducer if someone swallowed poison . : oEdit : 10-26-2012 ... . threw the berry disasters in the trash . They tasted THAT bad . To be fair , I 've still got some residual taste/smell issues following extensive chemotherapy- but I generally have trouble with savory things- not berries . I 'm still wondering if the red cabbage used to color them is the problem . Fish food flakes is the thing that immediately came to mind.Edit : later 10-26-2012 ... the Mixed Fruit flavor arrived today . These are separated into various flavors- the berry is the same nasty concoction as the Blueberry , Raspberry , and Boysenberry . There are supposed to be four flavors- I ca n't find but three- so who knows . One of them is tolerable- but I 'm not going to spend time fishing through a pile of fish flake smelling stuff to find the odd tolerable one . Trash bin fodder . Really not happy .	-1
I bought the Bark Free on the advice of a friend who said it worked well with her dog . I got it for my terrier as I moved into a new apartment and did n't want to disturb my neighbors . Based on the reviews posted here I turned on the audible tone so I could hear what set off the device . Being a rather loud sneezer , I realized my sneezes set off the device quite a bit . Also when I was doing the dishes the pots clanging would set off the device . My dog was aware of the sound and it would limit his barking to maybe 2 barks but then he bark again and his barking was a little less , but he was still barking . In the end I decided to return the item as it was too sensitive and a lot of things set it off , making the association with the barking and the sound of the device probably hard to tell to my dog . It did condition me to be more aware of my sneezing ... but I ca n't really control how many times I sneeze ... and it 's not called the sneeze free human training device .	-1
I have two yappy pomeranian dogs . The larger one periodically wears the Premier Gentle Spray Anti-Bark Dog Collar ( available from Amazon for approx $ 45 ) . It works wonderfully but it 's only recommended for dogs over 6 lbs . So I bought the Lentek to control barking in the smaller dog.I 've had it for two months now and still use it , but it only works minimally . The dogs sometimes pause a bit when it 's triggered , but most of the time they just continue barking.I guess the Lentek 's better than nothing , but I would n't buy it again . Instead , if your dog is over 6 lbs , I would buy the citronella collar .	-1
Did not work at all ... ..Do not buy this did not work at all even for small dogs ... waste of money I have a little gadget that I press a button and it has a high pitch that works much better ! ~	-1
Tested fine out of the box . Put it outside under an awning and it was dead the next morning . The dog next door never heard it so I do not know if it would have worked ?	-1
This did not work at all on my 2 small dogs . After I installed it right near their favorite window to bark at they stopped barking until it stopped making the noise but after repeating this a couple times they became immune to the noise and ignore it completely . Besides not working the other thing I did not like about this was the power cord . My fault for not reading the description close enough but I figured a product like this would probably be battery operated but it only runs using a power cord to an electrical outlet .	-1
Although the reviews were mixed , I was really , really hoping this was going to work for me since I live in an apartment and I am the only tenant with a dog . My dog 's barking is driving me crazy and I 'm sure it 's annoying my neighbors as well . Anyway , the Lentek arrived today and I plugged it in immediately . The noise emitted did cause my dog to stop barking BUT the device is so sensitive that the noise was being sent out whether my dog was barking or not . I know this because I initially had it set on & # 34 ; audible & # 34 ; to make sure it would be activated when my dog barked . ( It was set on & # 34 ; low & # 34 ; sensitivity . ) I do n't see how this could be effective if the alarm is going off non-stop even when my dog is not barking ... how is that going to train him not to bark ? I 'll be returning this ASAP .	-1
Charlie , our maltese/pomeranian mix is happiest when in the car with his head out the window . I got these googles to protect his eyes from the wind and debris . We 've got great pictures of him in the goggles , but they have to be snapped very quickly because he wo n't keep the goggles on for more than about thirty seconds . I 'm not sure if anything can be done about this in terms of product design . But unless your dog is completely docile , this will likely be a wasted purchase .	-1
First off , my dog ( 85 lb German Shepherd ) has pannus . The purpose of doggles is to protect his eyes from UV light so that he does n't go blind . I could care less about the coolness factor , this review is strictly based on the ability to protect my dogs eyes from the sun , and his comfort in wearing them.Second , I 'm writing the same review for all the doggles , as a comparison , so you do n't have to go looking through my other reviews to see how well the other types of doggles worked , or did n't work.Third , I only make my dog wear them when it is sunny or overcast outside . I generally try to take him for walks/runs when it is either early morning/evening , or cloudy days . But he 's full of energy , so I have to take him out on sunny days . This is when he wears doggles.With the disclaimers aside:1st choice : Doggles Mesh EyewearI only recently tried these , and wish I had tried them sooner . I think what kept me from buying these is that in the photos , it appears as if your dog is not able to see through these , and because it only protects from 50 to to 60 % of UV light . After spending ridiculous amounts of money in search for the perfect eye protection on every kind of doggle out there , this has become my first choice , though still far from perfect.My dog can see very well with these , tolerates these the best out of all the other doggles . Will play with these on , and even chase a ball if other dogs are around chasing the same ball . I have noticed that sometimes he ca n't follow the toy as well , but that seems to be based on how fast the toy is flying and how high I throw it . So I still have to change how I play with him , but at least now he will play with eye protection on , which is huge.The mesh is very light , which is why I think he does n't mind it . It is kind of awkward looking as the mesh has pointy ends that cause it to stick out and not be laying directly on his eyes . I had my dog wear these for a full day once , and when coming back inside , I noticed he did n't rub his eyes against the couch as much as he does with other doggles.The only reason I ca n't give this five stars is because it is only 50 to 60 % uv protection rather than a 100 % as offered with other doggles . This is a concern for me as the UV rays can really damage my dogs eyes due to the pannus . However , since my dog does n't try to take these off anywhere near as much as the other doggles , I feel he gets a lot more protection from these since he actually keeps them on.Since trying these , I have bumped down the ranking on the other doggles as noted below.1st and 2nd choice : Doggles Large K9 Optix sunglasses , framelessThese are by no means perfect , and I fear the day they get broken . So far they have lasted several months with taking extreme good care of them . The reason they are one of my top choices is because they are 100 % UV protection and my dog minds them the least ( with the exception of the mesh doggles which are half the UV protection ) . I think what he hates about most doggles is that they have a bulky and heavy frame ( from a dog 's perspective ) , and they are not one lens , thus making them heavier on his head , and reducing his visibility . With these frameless doggles he does generally well , and is only intolerant of them when he 's bored . He does n't try to take these off as much , and as long as I have him distracted ( going to a new place or chasing a critter ) , he does n't mind them . He will more often than not play ball or catch a Frisbee with these on , but sometimes not . I wish I could give these five stars , but they are flimsy , and will fall apart eventually . I gave it four stars simply because they have held together thus far , with extra care . What really made this my top choice , is that they are frameless . I can see a huge difference in how my dog sees through these doggles in comparison to other doggles . So this gets first place simply for his comfort in vision . The straps fit nicely behind his ears and under his chin . If only they were made a little more sturdy ... I am making these both my first and second choice because the mesh eyewear only offers half of the UV protection that these do , and I ca n't use the mesh eyewear on really bright sunny days due to lack of the UV protection.2nd choice : Doggles OriginalZThe doggles originalZ only come with one color lens , which really is n't a big deal , but I have learned that even on overcast days , my dog needs eye protection , and he 's less tolerant of these on overcast days versus on very sunny days . I think the darkness of the lens may reduce his visibility . He tries to paw his doggles off more so than with the frameless pair , but he minds these less than the ILS doggles . Overall , I 'm happy with these because he does do fairly well with them when distracted , but I can tell he dislikes them . He usually will not chase a ball or Frisbee with these on , especially if there are other dogs around . I think he ca n't see the ball/Frisbee as well , and other dogs can , so he just gives up . Unless we 're doing something new and exciting , he generally will find a shady spot , lay down , and watch the world play around him . It 's sad to see him this way , but going blind will be worse for him , so I keep making him wear them . The doggles are well designed with the strap that goes behind his head and under his chin , which is easily adjustable , and vent holes on the sides of the doggles so that his eyes do n't sweat/fog up.3rd choice : Doggles ILSI started out with the ILS doggles since they were the newest doggle out , and I liked the idea of the interchangeable lenses . I tried several colors of lenses , and found that my dog minds the brown lenses the least . It is nice to be able to remove the lenses that are scratched up and replace them with shiny new ones , and it 's also nice to put in the clear lenses for overcast days when I want my dog to be able to see more , with the darkest lenses on really sunny days . So why not my favorite doggle ? The dog hates them . The design is almost the same as the originalZ , with a few differences . The straps seem about the same as the originalZ , and the vent holes only differ in shape . The nose piece seems to be further apart than the originalZ , and even though the frame , when compared to the originalZ when not on , seems the same , they are a lot bulkier when on . I also found the foam that is between the doggles and the dogs eye is a little different , and seems to fall apart easier than the originalZ . The doggles company actually was kind enough to throw in some free foam with my latest order , but even super gluing it did n't seem to hold it well in place . Because the ILS doggles are much bulkier than the originalZ , and the dog hates bulky things on his face , he tries harder with these than any other doggles to get them off . Often , I find him running back to me with his doggles all distorted on his face with the straps all tangled . I have no idea how he manages , but it 's sad to see him running back to me for help to fix his doggles , which I 'm sure he 's hoping I take off . No way would he even consider chasing a ball or catching a Frisbee with these on.Last choice : Doggles K9 Optix Blue Rubber Gradient Frame with Smoke Lens SunglassesThese are almost frameless , top of the frame is very thin , so my dog did n't seem to mind them as much , however , they broke within a week , even with very careful use , and constant watching of my dog so that he does n't paw at them , and taking care to put them in a safe place when not in use . These were my favorite except for the fragility of them , until I found the frameless.Okay , for those designers out there that want to make the perfect doggle , I hope you are reading this . You need a single lens doggle that is still very durable , sturdily built , and not too bulky . Basically , a single lens across both eyes , with a very light frame if any , such as the mesh with a softer plastic that is still 100 % UV protection . Dogs are not human and do not see like humans , so why only create something that works for humans is beyond me . The frames in between the eyes are bothersome to the dog , and the bulk of most doggles ( especially the ILS ) causes discomfort . I actually bought a pair of ski goggles for humans and ended up sewing a chin strap to it to see if that would work , but it was too bulky and he was able to get them shook off by just shaking his head . But I could tell that his eyesight was just fine with the single lens.Lastly , when back inside and we remove the doggles , my dog immediately runs to the couch and rubs his eyes against it , which we talked to the dog eye specialist about . It was suggested , that after wearing doggles , rather than let the dog rub his eyes against objects , that we put icepacks on his eye area . Just a little hint for those who have the same problem .	-1
I live in a split level house which already causes an issue with where to place this thing . Got it setup how the instructions said and went to setting the perimeter flags , came to find out that it would have been the most ridiculous perimeter for the dogs to run in . Come to find out that the unit does a horrible job with terrain changes . Half of my yard dips down about two feet in the back for landscaping and the front of my house dips about four feet to be level with the road . Basically this causes a huge issue with this system getting a decent bubble . Basically i have to resort to getting a fence .	-1
We have had this system for quite a while and it started off great , over time the transmitter died and we had to get a replacement , now they collars do n't work ! We have 2 dogs and one of the collars is extremely sensitive and wo n't the let dog move far from the transmitter and the other can go where ever he wants ! The batteries are new btw . I just went to call the dogs inside and had to search for one of them until I finally found him wayyyyy outside his range ! We will be using this system for quick trips with the dogs to my parents house , but will still need to watch them . We are upgrading to the dogwatch underground system .	-1
I found the signal from the transmitter to be inconsistent . Despite 4-5 calls to the company for assistance , I was unable to set up the perimeter flags to create the boundaries needed . I returned it for a refund .	-1
This product was not for us . We live on a hill and when used the containment area fluctuated . We returned this product .	-1
I have two Cavalier King Charles Spaniels , my sister who has an enormous yard , has two Maltese . She installed this system mostly for my pups so they could play outside when I was forced to travel . Training went great for her two and for my ruby-Gypsy . They yard kept them contained and there were no issues , no one like being zapped.However this did last very long , Barkley - the black and tan , soon learned he could stand just within the warning zone of the beep till the battery ran down . Then he could safely exit . I watched him do this , so did his `` friends '' . Now this rather expensive fence and set of four collars is worthless.So , I would evaluate your dog 's intelligence/ stubbornness before making this purchase .	-1
This was great , until it was n't . Even though I had the problems with the noisy impeller , after I put a little vasoline on it it stopped the noise . Everything was fine until I came home today to do my weekly maintenance and the filter was dead ! I know it was working last week when I did a water change but I have no idea when it quit working . Fortunately I have two filters running so my fish are ok . This filter only lasted six months so I 'm very disappointed .	-1
Updated review , my aqua clear 30 just died on me.Came home and saw no water coming down . Motor isnt even running and its plugged in.Avoid this manufacture 's failure of a filter .	-1
I have older aquaclear filters that are dead silent . The newer Hagen filters are far from that . I 'm on my 2nd AC110 do to impeller noise.I went through 4 flucal C2 filters before i got one that stayed a tolerable noise levels.Their customer service has gone down the hole too . Sure , they offer to repair/replace parts , but demand you send in your defective filter first . Being a company that deals in fish supplies , they should know that the filter is the main component keeping your fish alive . So basically they know you ca n't send in your part and you are forced to buy another filter , or live with the default . I feel bad making amazon send me replacement filters for something as small as an unbalanced impeller . Hagen should just send the replacement parts first , then we could send back the defective unit with out having to buy another filter or risking any harm to the fish . Other filter companies send replacement parts with minimal questions asked and often do n't ask for the faulty piece back.This will probably be the last Hagen filter i buy after the quality issues I 've had with my new AC110 and Fluval filters .	-1
Filter worked fine for 3.5 months and then died . Never had a filter that quit after such a short period of time .	-1
I love the filter . I have six freshwater aquaria and each has an Aquaclear filter . Just do n't be tempted to save a few dollars and order from warehouse deals . It was missing media , missing parts , and the parts that were there were broken . Of course , Amazon , being the great company that it is , handled it - refunded my money and scheduled a pick up . All I had to do was put it back in the box and put it out for UPS.This is the fourth time I have made a purchase from warehouse deals . Their packing is terrible and everything has arrived broken . From Amazon direct or one of their many sellers I have never had anything but perfection ! !	-1
Unit was great until the motor died after six months . A replacement motor from manufacturer costs more than the whole unit .	-1
After I got tired of of playing with my Marineland Penguin 200 , which never worked quite correctly ( I think it was defective ) , I decided to try the Aquaclear 50 , which I had seen recommended often in various online forums and reviews . It has been cited as a HOB filter that performs more like a canister filter.This filter does indeed mimic a canister filter . It contains a large sponge , carbon bag ( which is somewhat costly to replace , but , as you know , can be easily modified ) and media bag filled with noodles to increase biological filtration . When this filter performs , it performs well.So , why the two stars ? There are two qualities about this filter that make it ultimately undesirable : 1 . It is difficult to use , 2 . It is unreliable.Let me first talk about its difficulty . Putting this together and inserting the media are quite easy ; getting it started is another thing . It comes with a leveling device to help make sure this is level on the tank . This device repeatedly pops out of its slot , to the point that I have to search for it on the floor behind my tank stand every time I service the tank . Priming it is another problem . This is one of the trickiest HOB filters to prime . One of the main reasons I disposed of my Penguin 200 is that it was a great challenge to prime . As I mentioned , I think the Penguin was defective . The Aquaclear is even more challenging to prime , and I think it is meant to work this way . ( I have another Aquaclear on a separate tank that behaves the same way . ) Sometimes , I have to disassemble the entire filter before I can prime it . `` You must be doing something wrong , '' someone is thinking right now . No . I 'm sorry . If I have to use a level on a HOB filter before I can properly use it , then the filter is at fault , not me.The other major problem with this filter is that it is unreliable . It is not self-priming . I often have to leave town for several days , and I like having the peace of mind that , after a power outage , my filtration will continue to operate . What good is an effective system of filtration if it fails to work ? But , you say , the Aquaclear provides the best biological filtration available in a HOB filter . If you want effective biological filtration in a HOB filter that is also self-priming and reliable , you wo n't find one on the market . However , if you buy aTetra Whisper Power Filter 60 , 60-Gallonand fill it withMarineland PA11486 Canister Filter Bio-Balls PC 160-360 , 90-BioBalls , you will have biological filtration that is just as effective as that provided by the Aquaclear in a filter that is self-priming and easy to use.If that does n't appeal to you , buy aAqueon 06117 QuietFlow 50 Power Filter , 250-GPHand shove a piece of bio-sponge in the back behind the cartridges . The Aqueon filters are totally self-priming and never fail to work after a power outage because of their clever design.With just a simple mod , you can have a filter that is even better than the Aquaclear without the hassle .	-1
I did n't like this filter at all . It stopped working after 2 weeks . I had to return it and replace it with a different filter .	-1
I loved this filter for the last three weeks until I accidentally switched it off . For two hours I was freaking out because it would not start . I filled it with water to prime it , took the media out to make sure it was n't stopped up , etc . Finally , I gave it a little whack -- not to hard , but just enough . Turns out the filter was not perfectly level and therefore would not restart.24 hours later , I turned it off to see if it would restart without problem . Now I checked everything again , I made sure to prime it with water , make sure it is level , etc , etc . It will not start . I 've been un-plugging it checking everything , priming , plugging it back in , etc , etc.For all the benefits people tout for this filter , it sure has one major problem ... IT WO N'T START . This is absolutely ridiculous , I am furious and frustrated with this hunk of junk . I just ordered a sponge filter as a back up for when this thing is being temperamental . In the meantime , I might have to run to the pet store and find something to replace it -- should it continue to not start . Absolutely ridiculous . Fix this problem and I might consider buying another one . Until then , this thing might just find its way to the trash can . And I really hope my fish do n't die because if they do , I will never buy another product made by Hagen EVER . ***LATER***FINALLY***After pulling the whole thing apart ( AGAIN ) , rinsing out the sponge , sticking a q-tip into the impeller area to make sure it was n't blocked ( it was n't ) , this piece started working again . Something this temperamental should definitely not be relied upon as a primary filter . End of story.I gave it two stars because other than being a big pain in the rear to restart , it actually is quiet and functions quite reliably . Also , I had to put some mesh around the intake because my little dwarf frog was nearly sucked ( legs first ) into the filter -- I caught him just in a nick of time . Thankfully , Mr Bubbles is OK ! !	-1
I 've been using these for years . The last one lasted over 10 years before it started making noise . I expected the new one to be as quiet as a mouse , just as the old one was when I first installed it.However this one is even noisier than the old one . I threw away the container , and obviously it 's used , so what now ? Am I stuck with this ? I ca n't believe it . I just paid $ 50.00 for more noise . What is going on ?	-1
Honestly the filter is a good filter as I got one from petsmart a year ago and was looking to add more filtration to my tank . The one from Petsmart gets 4 out of 5 stars . I subtracted one from it because I have converted to cannisters . Now onto my experience of ordering this product from Amazon which gets one star ... I ordered two of these filters and both were cracked/broken . The first one I immediately discovered when taking the filter out of the box as the sharp plastic piece that was broken on the bottom lip of the filter was very sharp and almost cut me . I immediately returned the filter and went to order another one thinking that I just had bad luck and it got damaged during transit . The second one came in and looked a little banged up , but I did n't notice anything too bad except a few scratches . It was 3 months later when I noticed that my floor was wet that the 2nd one had a very small crack in it on the same side as the cracked first one and that water was SLOWLY leaking out of down the side of the tank onto the floor . I would not order this product from Amazon as they are 0 for 2 with this product . I have since ordered a canister . I am not a happy customer as I do not think I will be able to return it as it has been 3 months since I purchased .	-1
I really like the filtration setup that the Aquaclear has . It 's a stacked filter media design : foam on bottom , carbon in middle , and bio on top . Very simple and effective.However ... This filter is far too noisy for a quiet bedroom environment . Do a simple search on the internet and you 'll see plenty of people complaining about the impeller rumble/rattling noise . I have to leave the lid off of it while it 's running because with it on , the noise level jumps up by about a factor of 2 . It 's very obnoxious.A better option is the Fluval U2 . It 's virtually silent and has very effective filtration capability .	-1
I bought it for my turtle and fish and it just does not filter anything and I tested it to see if maybe i was wrong and I was not . I think i might have to rethink even having pets at all since I can not get the right equipment for them	-1
I received this unit with the tank cracked at the bottom of the tank . The plastic just seems to be that easily crack stuff . I bought a penguin 200 instead and it turned out to be that black durable plastic and the filter works great .	-1
First this is a good filter . There are no smells coming from my tank . It has a nice design and love the different inserts and being able to replace them individually as needed and not everything at once.I received this filter about 2 weeks ago . Installation was simple and easy . Only had to adjust the inserts so it would fit properly , no big deal.Everything was working great for the first 2 days , but then the water flow start going down to almost a trickle and this was on max filtration . Twice I came home from work and there was absolutely no flow going on , yet it was plugged in , the propeller was running ( I could hear it ) , and there was plenty of water in the filter . First thing I did was make sure the `` U '' tube was snugged to the propeller . The tank was n't dirty either , but I cleaned the filter anyways on only the 7th day of having it . The water flow got slightly better , but still not at its full potential . I left it alone , but the second time I had come home from work ( As mentioned above ) I just about gave up on it and started considering either getting a refund or ask for help online . I checked Hagen 's website for help and asked here on Amazon . The responses I got back were helpful , but nothing I had not tried already.I decided to clean it one last time and found a solution to my problem . After cleaning it , the water flow was going great and as I was going to put on the cover for the filter until I realized I installed the `` U '' tube backwards . It 's been a week and I have had NO problems what so ever . I even switched the `` U '' tube back properly and got a weak water flow.I 've had fish and a turtle for over 20 years and this is a first for me . It does n't bother my turtle at all even during feeding . I ca n't figure out why it will work one way and not the other , but it does.UPDATE : Stopped working out of no where . Came home from work and was n't running . Only had it for less then 6 months .	-1
I have three Petsafe collars that I have had for 3 years or so . They have worked very well , until recently , and are starting to fail . But they have been used a lot on large active dogs outdoors , so I am happy with the service life . That 's why I decided to buy another one.This new collar seemed like a great improvement to the original models when I read the info on Amazon 's web site , and in some ways it is . But the very poor collar design that supports the control box renders it horrible . It has both a clasp and a clip , which is a total pain in the a** to put on the dogs . The new clip is n't strong enough to stay connected on its own , and the clasp is a pain to use . It worked fine in its original form , so why did they change it ? I will be buying a collar with a good plastic clip and remounting it.You can turn it off , and adjust the power level , both of which are nice improvements , but ... .	-1
Not worth the money at all . Spending this much on a collar for just Bark Control is really not worth it . An electronic training collar is a much better investment .	-1
Did n't work as well as battery operated collars . Charging is a pain . Just more cords and chargers to lay around the house .	-1
I placed this collar on my dog it took several barks from him then all of a sudden he yelped really loud and all 4 paws left the ground , he leaped about a foot into the air . I instantly removed the collar and had to calm him down . I never put it on him again this is not the way to train a dog it 's cruelty . I felt so bad I did this to him . I sure would n't want 2 prongs sticking in my neck shocking me .	-1
Easily installed in our patio door . Dogs learned to use it in five minutes , but they 're Westies and smart as heck . Has lasted almost a year now with dogs chasing each other through . Love it.EDIT . After a year the little teat that the door swivels on , at top broke off . Only a year warranty , I guess I am out of luck . However , It 's the best of the doors I have seen for screens so I bought another and installed it again . No problem there . Hope I get more than a bit over a year out of it.New Edit June 20 , 2014..Over the past few months I have tried to repair the second door a few times , different ways , and have put it back together quite a few times . This product is flawed . We have two Westies , these are n't big gregarious dogs , but going in and out , they broke the door again . I will NOT buy from this company again . Concept is great , product DOES NOT hold up . Cheap plastic that falls apart easily . Since then I went to the local big box home store that sells real dog doors and used 2X4 's to build a frame and put it in . Works like a charm . Maybe it 's a bit of overkill , but until someone can make a decent product , that is durable , this may be your only option.I now ONLY review products that are exceedingly good or horribly bad ... this one is in the latter category	-1
We have several of these doors . They work ok ... but if your animal gets too excited when running in and out ... it can get pulled out ... or..at minimum ... damage your screen . I think it is the only affordable option on the market that is easy to install and where the door stays reasonably closed to avoid bugs from coming in . It . Matches our bronze anodized black screen doors too .	-1
The litter continued to be tracked through the house despite keeping this carpet clean . I watched and the cats were not jumping over it , the mat just did not remove the little from their little feet , which after all is what it was supposed to do . So in the trash it goes .	-1
Home Depot and Ace Hardware and probably lots of places sell this stuff for under $ 2 a running foot . It 's maybe 40 inches wide . I buy several feet and cut to fit my odd shaped bathroom floor in my RV .	-1
I thought that this was supposed to trap the litter , but it does n't . I have litter all over my floor around the carpet . It 's also very hard to clean .	-1
This would be a very good litter trapping mat if you could wash it . I had mine a few days and was liking it ... when one of my cats overshot the box and urine went on the carpet . I checked all over the packaging of the carpet ; there we no washing instructions . I put it in the washing machine because I really did not think that hand washing was going to get it clean . The result : the backing came off of this mat ... leaving me with a washing machine full of this horrible grey gritty substance ( that used to be the backing of the carpet . ) I do n't particularly want to own a product that is made to be used around a litter box that is NOT MACHINE WASHABLE . That is too much work when I already have enough to do with multiple cats and several litter boxes . If you want a mat that you have to wash gently in the bathtub or take outside and hose off with soap and water and air dry , then buy this mat ... otherwise , save your money ! ! I think I 'll use the one I have in the garage for something ... until it finds its final resting place in a landfill : (	-1
I thought for the price , this mat would keep the litter from getting everywhere . It is hard to clean this mat and I find litter on the bare floor as before . So I am going to find another one . I do not recommend this mat because it does n't do what it advertises it is suppose to do . It is also extremely hard to keep clean , which does n't make any sense .	-1
I routinely leave my cat alone on the weekends and need something so that he does n't eat everything in sight while I 'm gone . For a while , I was leaving a self-feeder out for him , but he was eating himself sick ( and chubby ) . So , I decided he needed something a little more controlled and thought this might be it . I was a bit concerned about what some reviewers have said about their cats figuring out how to turn the bowl themselves , but after about 6 months now , I have n't had any problems with him figuring that out . He 's not scared of the whirring and knows exactly what that means - food time ! There were n't instructions on the lid like in the picture but it was n't hard to program . It takes a little getting used to , but its easier to program than my alarm clock which might explain why I often leave this set but empty to wake me up in the morning to remind me to feed the kitty.Things I wish it did : Actually have room for 5 meals . The first compartment is uncovered so that does n't really count . Also , it says that it can accomodate wet food , but that is n't true either . There is no way to keep it cold for any amount of time . I tried to put an ice pack underneath in this little reservoir but it did n't keep anything cold , was too small a space for a normal-sized ice pack and was under the open compartment which does n't really need to be kept cool anyway.It keeps the munchkin fed while I 'm gone , but I sometimes regret paying as much for it as I did . It does n't meet enough of my needs to feel justified but I 'm not sure what a better alternative would be . =/	-1
I found this product too bulky and not easy to use for a daily basis . I sent it back and not recommended because I found it too bulky and difficult to set .	-1
This contraption latches at the dial , which unlatches at the desired time . On the far end , the latched door has about 1cm of play , and it is trivial for a finger or a cat paw to get between the door and the lip . It is then easy to force the thin food dish out through the latched lid , even without opposable thumbs or a homo sapiens intellect.I put food in this unit and set it for 12 hours . I placed the unit on the floor . My cat began attacking it , and was noshing within 10 minutes . Amazon.com is making it easy to return , so I guess I 'll try another feeder .	-1
One of the feeders got stuck and the dial wont move anymore , causing the food in it to attract ants from all over the place . This was such a waste of money and I can no longer return it because the return window closed a few days before this piece of worthless dung decided to break . My cat was n't very fond of it even before it broke . Please save yourself the money by buying a higher quality feeder that doesnt break after a few uses .	-1
We bought this unit after researching several options . We knew this had a space for an ice pack , but it was n't until we got it home that we could see that the ice pack only keeps one compartment cold at a time -- the one that is in the & # 34 ; open & # 34 ; position . The other four compartments are not kept cold . We do n't prefer to portion and freeze our pet food ahead of time . The idea was to make it more convenient , not make it strategically more challenging . For wet food , this is not a good choice .	-1
I got the 2-meal version of this product . I have two cats , one of which is very food aggressive and will do his best to get into any container that smells like it has food in it . He was able to get into this pet feeder within an hour by prying open the flimsy plastic top.I like the idea behind it , however . The timer works well enough , but is not for precise timing ( you can get it within a half hour or so ) . This would be excellent for cats that are n't food-aggressive or clever enough to figure it out .	-1
It is a high quality item - probably the highest of all that I have seen . However , this will not work for smart dogs or cats ! Granted the dog probably wont be able to open the lid , but they do n't have to . The tray on the inside does not lock into position . It only takes a small amount of pressure to push on the side of the food compartment and make it rotate over to the next one ! My Australian Shepherd had this figured out in a matter of days , and even my coating the open compartment in apple bitter spray did not stop him.This thing is useless if you have a smart animal.It is now completely useless to me . I 'm going to purchase one of the autofeeders with the reservoir bin that drops food into a bowl , cut the bottom out of the bowl , and mount the thing HIGH on the wall where my dog can not reach it . It 'll drop the food onto the floor and he can have a blast cleaning it up . I think this is the only way I 'm going to be able to get any of these things to work with him .	-1
I bought this feeder to get my cats on a regular feeding schedule that did n't depend on me , with the hope of stopping the association between me and food . Unfortunately , this did n't really work out . After using it for a few days , my two cats were following me around more than ever with constant meowing to indicate their nearness to death by starvation . When I was nearby the feeder for longer than usual , I figured out why this was as I watched one of my cats pull out the food containers from under the locking top . Essentially , the cats would wait until I left the room and pull out the containers and eat all of the food . Hours later , when the feeder was supposed to open , they would be starving again . This was a fatal flaw , and I ended up having to return the product .	-1
After trying multiple batteries and reading what little instructions there were , I had to return this unit . I 'm hoping another one is on the way and that this was just a faulty unit .	-1
My cat has hard to control diabetes , and must be fed a small meal every 4 hours around the clock . We got this auto feeder in the hopes that we could teach her to recognize the sound that it makes when it turns , then set the timer and give her two small meals at specific times during the night , so we could get some much needed uninterrupted sleep . But , the timer goes off when it 's not supposed to , so she ca n't make the connection between the sound of the circular divided dish rotating , and available food . If this is something that you need to use for a situation like ours , where the timer really must work accurately for your animal to get a feeding at a particular time , then this item may not be a good bet . We 're going to return this auto feeder , as we can not trust it to do what we need it to do . Perhaps the problem lies with the individual feeder that we were sent , but if you get one , remember to be very careful if timing is important , like it is for our cat . Also , there is a design problem that my cat has with this model , which is that the individual dishes in the circular divided area are really deep and kind of have corners , so it 's awkward for her to get the food out , and she does n't really like sticking her face and whiskers in such a deep well . I think the design of it would work much better for a dog than a cat , but if the timing device on the auto feeder worked properly , then I believe she could get used to eating from it during the night , or if we were away for more than four hours .	-1
Despite some of the negative reviews , I purchased this item anyway because there were far more positive reviews . WHAT A MISTAKE ! ! ! We went away this past weekend where on Friday I set up the timers to open on 2 separate occasions during our absence . We returned Sunday morning to see that they never opened . My poor cat is 8 and a half years old and he went without food for 48 hours ! ! ! ! We feel so terrible and guilty . I 'm returning this piece of & # $ * $ * #	-1
I ordered the Iris 30-qt food storage container with casters . What I received was a bird seed dispenser . I realize mistakes happen so I returned it the same day in the original box along with a copy of my order for the storage container . Instead of sending the right product , I received an e-mail saying they were refunding my credit card . No explanation for why they were n't sending the container , no apology . And I 'm ripped off for the return postage of a little over eight dollars . I subsequently ordered an almost identical item on Amazon from another company and am pleased with it . P.S . It was cheaper , too !	-1
I 'm not sure if this product actually works or not as far as helping to establish your beneficial bacterial colony . The & # 34 ; bacteria & # 34 ; is mixed in with bran flakes and floats around on the water surface . Really messy in a small aquarium . Might be okay for a pond or outside water garden with fish .	-1
I ordered this product and the bottle I received had a completely different label , I got Mardel Quick Cure with a blue label , it looked nothing like the yellow label pictured here , perhaps its the same thing and the company was sold , but who knows . I tried the product for & # 34 ; cotton mouth & # 34 ; on a few of my cardinal tetras , it looks like the fungus has shrunk in size but after two weeks of the 1/2 dose recommended for tetras they still have the white growths on their mouths , i will move on and try something else .	-1
I bought this pump at Petsmart about 2 yrs ago and it barely functioned at all . I returned it and ordered a Hagen Elite from Amazon that has been working perfect non-stop for 2 yrs . I recently set up a new tank and was looking for an air pump , and decided with all the good reviews , to try a Rena again hoping my bad experience was a fluke . Well the same exact thing happened . This thing was barely capable of literally sending 3 or 4 bubbles every minute out of an air wall . So I went to my local aquarium store and purchased a Hagen Elite again ( which was half the price of the Rena ) , as I should have done in the first place . Worked perfect , sending out a thousand bubbles a minute . One bad experience could be bad luck , but not two . I would never purchase a Rena air pump again .	-1
I 've had this pump for roughly two years . It works fine and everything but one day I needed to change the airline and while doing so , the knob that the line slips over broke off at the base ! I 've pretty much treated this pump with kid gloves for these two years . I use it at room temperature , I do n't store it weird with anything putting pressure on the knob , and I do n't take off and on the airline frequently . I think the time it broke was maybe the third time I changed the airline . And I was n't yanking on it either.Therefore , there is no reason for this breaking besides it being of poor workmanship.So I called Rena to see if they 'd rectify the matter or if there 's even a part that could be purchased to replace it and while the gentleman that I spoke to was very polite , they would n't stand behind their product because the short one year warranty was up . He also said that I could purchase a casing ( at my expense of course ) IF this guy he gave me the number to has any . I did n't even have that option because it was a dead number.So let 's review:1 . Puts out air fine.2 . Knob breaks with regular or less than regular use.3 . Manufacturer wo n't even stand behind product when defect reflects on their own workmanship.My conclusion is that there are many air pumps that will pump air that do n't break and will be backed up by the manufacturer when they 're at fault . My money is best spent on one of those other brand 's air pumps .	-1
A coworker bought this air pump to use with one of those air bubble wands . It worked great ... . for a while . I have lots of other brands of air pumps , most of them the inexpensive kind and they last and last and last . I 've had some for 7 years and not even had to replace the bladder . This Rena is only four years old . Since we have moved Turtle to a larger tank with better filter , the wimpy air pump was n't a big deal . I decided to take a chance and purchase the repair kit for this little pump . Nope , it did n't help . I wanted to see how much air was coming out so I attempted to remove the air line . Air lines on these pumps always seem to get really stiff and you have to cut them off . The problem with this pump is that the outlet is recessed and you ca n't get a a knife in there to cut the tubing . Snapped the outlet right off . Fortunately , I had purchased a Whisper Air as a backup . That air pump does n't have the flawed outlet like the Rena and it 's also quiet . It came with a T so that you could use it with two devices.I have a Million Air 300 on my 30 gallon tank which I purchased more than seven years ago and it 's still going strong . This Rena air pump is an overpriced piece of crap . The only positive thing about this pump is that it 's quiet . I ca n't bring myself to give it two stars .	-1
This stuff will raise the ammonia level in your aquarium extremely , make the water cloudy and kill your fish . It does NOT neutralize ammonia , nitrate or nitrite . I do NOT recommend this product at all . I have always used Prime and for some reason decided to try this . Big mistake ! I highly recommend Prime , it is much better for your aquarium and fish . It removes chlorine , chloramine , ammonia and detoxifies nitrite and nitrate and provides an excellent slime coat . If you want your fish to live and do well use Prime by Seachem , not this ! !	-1
I live where the water is so soft there 's almost no minerals in it at all . Maintaining a Ph of 7.0 was difficult but possible , but my snails had the white pitting and my guppy had fin rot that he contracted during the time when I was totally new to fish keeping and did n't understand how important it is to snails and guppies to keep the Ph at or above 7.0.I had finally got the situation under control . My guppy 's fins were regenerating and my snails had new shell growth that was healthy.Then I made the grave mistake of trying this product . Aloe vera ? So what . Looked like a stupid gimmick . Since when do fish need aloe vera ? Do we need to pull them out of the tank and rub moisturizing cream on them too ? How about some Lubriderm ? Anyway , shortly after switching to this product my Ph crashed to 6.0 . My guppy 's fins started rotting and got worse than ever , and the healthy growth on my snails that survived me climbing the learning curve last Summer now have white calcified shell damage . I do n't even recognize the two I named just a few months ago ! I was doing emergency water changes morning and evening just to keep the Ph at about 6.4 . ( My tap water is totally soft , but comes out of the tap at PH of about 7.2 ) . My hands got raw and cracked because I was washing my hands so much after working with the tank so much.I asked myself what had changed when this started , and the only thing I came up with was switching to this aloe vera stress coat . Then I looked up aloe vera juice on the Internet and found it has a Ph of 3.5 to 5.0 depending on where I looked . Wow , I thought , maybe putting something with Ph that low in the tank could throw the whole Ph down quite a bit.I bought some Tetra brand stress coat and did a few more water changes ( some cracks in hands bleeding now , maybe MY hands could use some aloe vera ! ! ) and soon the Ph climbed back up to 6.8.I did two emergency salt dips for the guppy , whose fin rot had begun on his body too . It looks like the rot has been halted . The damage has been done to my snails . Maybe once I get this under control I 'll have time to just stare at the tank a while and figure out who is who again through all the shell damage.So , thanks API for putting my fish and snails through hell . Brilliant idea mixing a super low Ph substance in with water conditioner . Did you test this thoroughly before you put it into production ? Anyway , I could rant further but I think it 's time to rub some Vaseline moisture lotion on my cloud fish . They really need to chill out .	-1

I own this product and I own the Aqueon equivalent . Obviously , this type of product is a must for any serious aquarium owner , but the Python version of this hose is seriously crappy compared to the Aqueon . The piece that connects to the faucet leaks and is not well built . Just tonight I was cleaning my aquariums and the faucet piece broke in half while filling and sprayed water all over myself and my kitchen . The Aqueon version has never leaked and is clearly better made . I just wish my Aqueon was 50 foot instead of 25 , as I 'd definitely use it exclusively .	-1
I do not know why but even with floating food pellets they sink very quickly after putting food in the holder . I do not want to turn off the canister under the tank . I bought this in the hope I would not have to turn off the canister or aeration devices . Oh well , I tried .	-1
I guess for the price I should n't complain much but the glass on my top was not cut straight . A very obvious curve was on the side of the glass and so I had to force the top down into my aquarium 's rim . This probably was n't a smart thing to do on my part but I 'm not going to waste time shipping the item back and wait another week or more for a replacement . The glass also slips out of the plastic piece that allows it to be opened , possibly falling into the tank .	-1
I orderd this for my 20G tall . The picture is deceiving . there is a front piece of glass and a back piece of glass and then a small piece of plastic . if you have a HOB filter or anything somewhat big you will not be able to use this canopy . junk .	-1
I used to order this for my dog who would eat these like they were going out of style . But then the price kept jumping up ... they were about $ 19 a yr ago , but now they 're almost $ 32 . I 'm not sure if it 's Stewart who keeps jacking up the price or if it 's Amazon , but anyways it 's no longer a bargain.So I ended up getting their competitor PureBites , which supposedly only gives you 16.6 oz vs the 21 oz for Stewart 's . But I found that the 16 oz from PureBites filled up the whole Stewart 's Tub , meaning I was paying for the weight of Stewart 's plastic bottle -- what a ripoff ! In short , I 'll stick with PureBites which only charges you for the weight of the beef liver , unlike Stewart 's which charges you for the weight of it 's plastic bottle . You 'll end up with the same amount of beef liver but you 'll save your self some money with the PureBites . It 's ridiculous that Stewart 's charges people for the weight of the packaging and not just of the beef liver . See ya Stewart 's !	-1
I have purchased this item frequently over the years but this time the liver bits were fractured and mostly too small to handle . Using treats for dog training requires bits that can be held in the hand and fed . If they are too big or too small it is hard or impossible to work it . Perhaps I got a bad batch but about 20 % of the container was `` powder '' while another 30 % was too small to hold . About half the bin was useful . Win some , lose some . This was a loss .	-1
He LOVES dehydrated liver . I make it for him all the time , so I thought he 'd love THIS , too , and it would be good when/if I did n't have my homemade dehydrated ready . I bought two big containers and he wo n't touch it ! I ended up giving it away . I think it 's the freeze drying process . Dehydrating keeps the flavor better . Have YOU ever eaten freeze dried food ? I have and it tasted awful . So , it you want to try this , get a small bag first , so you do n't waste your money like I did .	-1
No way my small dog could get through these treats . They are so dry , stringy and tough . Money thrown away .	-1
The main problem with this product is that the treat pieces are very big . I have to break them with my hands ( or sometimes cut them ) to make them small enough to use as training treats . If they were small enough , they 'd be great training treats because they are so cheap . However , I do n't think they 're as suitable as non-training treats , mainly because I have much better quality treats for my dog that he enjoys a lot more.I have n't found much use for these dried liver treats ... the tub has been sitting there for several months and is still practically full .	-1
My dog never thought it as a treat . He did n't gobble them up as I expected . Instead , he would bury them . Do n't know why , but I 've learned to trust his opinion .	-1
Got two of these and they worked well - kept the heat up and everything as they were supposed to ... but then I noticed that when the lights came on to raise the terrarium temperature , my gecko ( who is fairly shy ) would freeze and not move until the light went out again ... I was curious and asked some herp experts WHY this was . Well , they explained to me that though reptiles may not be able to see RED , they can still see BRIGHT LIGHTS so while they would not be able to see , say , a red dress as a red dress , they still notice a bright light popping on periodically . The gecko would freeze when this occured because it was like having an exceptionally bright full moon suddenly shining on them , cause their instinct which tell them that bright light increases the chance of predators finding and eating them to kick in and the gecko to stop moving . I was advised to switch to a ceramic heat emitter which emits NO light which I have since done . The lights are still around in case the heat emitters run in to trouble , but they will be a stop gap rather than a staple .	-1
This product was pretty much the worst thing I have ever ordered for our terrariums . The item is made out of cheap metal . It 's & # 34 ; wobbly & # 34 ; . The feet actually press up against the glass on the bottom of the terrarium when you put it in place . Nothing about this is good .	-1
i had smaller tanks with a small bioload . it gave my fish finrot . in the other tank i didnt have it in there as long and the finrot isnt as bad.didnt have issues before adding purigen.i tested my water and it was fine . it seems that whatever it did to my water , there wasnt a test for it.my once beautiful fish are now raggy ; [ maybe just get this stuff if you have a big bioload and a messy tank.i just wanted a filter media that i wouldnt have to keep repurchasing.this is an expensive purchase for me since i 've bought the purigen and several extra bags for it .	-1
Does n't do anything , I add one cap full twice a week for my forty six bow and the plants are just turning brown and dieing , will by leafzone next time that stuff works and makes them thrive , now I 'm out the price of this bottle and eleven bucks in plants . Live and learn	-1
Did n't work at all and I followed directions precisely . Same problem existed .	-1
I have had Aquariums for well over 20 yrs & usually love all Seachemm products but this was never accurate at all & did n't hold to 125 gal tank glass very well either	-1
Worthless . Pay the money and get the entire water testing kit .	-1
It really does n't work . Perhaps the ones you buy in a store will , but this one I bought online certainly does n't . Yes , if you hold it over a bottle of windex that gets it to change color , but in my tank when the ammonia level rises , and is confimed with regular test tube kits , this alerter does n't change color at all . Would not buy again	-1
Over the last 15 years I have tried every brand of carbon out there . From Marinlan to the generic brands even some of the store brands that you buy from Petco or Petsmart.Does this work ? Oh yeah quite well in fact . BUT so does the cheap stuff . I have bought 3lb bags of generic carbon from a seller here on Amazon and that stuff works just as well.The difference ? On this product they break it all into tiny little bits compared to the cheap stuff is usually in pellet form.personally I have considered even grinding or blending ( in a blender ) the cheap stuff to see if you can achieve the same consistency as the more prepared stuff from this company or Marineland . Not that I can or can not prove ot really makes any difference.Personally I am going back to the cheap stuff . I clean my filter every two months and replace the carbon then and like I said ca n't see any difference . At least not one worth paying 5x as much for .	-1
Iv been using this food for my fish for a while and I 'm just starting to realize its killing my fish.I gave this to my fish once a week , every time I used this food at least one of my fish would die.I stopped using this food for a few months and not one fish died , used it again and two fish died.The worms expand in the fishes stomach and kills them.The directions on the back of food says soak the worms , which I never did since I never knew fish food had directions.Well even after soaking the worms in water for 5 minutes the fish still died .	-1
I 've used this for years with many cats.My most recent purchase is a new formula . It 's runny goop that the cats hate ... .I wasted money on several tubes.My search begins for another brand ... ..	-1
The new company that now sells petromalt changed the recipe and my cats HATE it.They used to crowd around wanting their weekly dose , but now they scatter and run when they see the tube ! I switched to LaxatoneLaxatone 4.25oz tubeColbetz Himalayan CatteryColbetz.com	-1
I normally get a ultra-concentrated supplement but ordered this one because I did not have time to go to the fish store.This stuff left a file on the water and made the fountain foam . I measured it correctly because I had just cleaned out the aquarium and rinsed the rocks.I 'm just not happy with it and hope the fish are okay . I 'm not saying do n't buy it but I wo n't get it a second time .	-1
I have a white haze in my tank and was hoping this would get rid of it . It did not , in fact it makes the water 2x as cloudy until it wears off . Oh well , maybe it 's my water .	-1
Fish owners , stop wasting your money on this product and buy Seachem Prime . You will not go back to this weak water conditioner .	-1
So , I used this initially when I first got an aquarium because someone else told me they used it . At first all was fine , it does what it needs to do by getting rid of the ammonia/chlorine from tap water.Here 's the thing , these water conditioners that have `` slime coat '' crap in them , the way they work is by BURNING the fish , the irritation induces them to produce their slime coat . I was n't aware of this , but when I was using it , I noticed that some of my fish would always flash - swim rapidly up and down the glass - I did n't know if it was them being `` excited '' to have a water change , no , they were just in pain/stressed.Anyway , after coming to the end of my bottle in like 1 month 's time , I ordered Seachem Safe ( powder version of Prime ) . My fish no longer flash , and it works better , way more cost efficient . Save your money , buy Safe or Prime , both are way better .	-1
I bought this for my Betta Fish and found it does not keep the water clear longer . I suggest using distilled or purified water when cleaning a Betta Fish tank . Once you 've transferred your Betta to clean water ( do not use tap water ) , rinse and clean tank , gravel and fake plants with HOT water . Refill 1/3 of tank with distilled or purified water , Pour fish back in tank and fill tank to 3/4 of distilled or purified water . If you have a Betta , you do n't need this . Do you best not to over feed them .	-1
This is a replacement tube for the one that already comes with the product . It can not be use to `` extend '' the tube for a taller tank without restricting water flow , as the name implies .	-1
its gettin 2 stars because it doesnt fit very well . granted i lost the black pc . that came with the powerhead . but some teflon tape wrapped around the end works .	-1
Lost my leveling device when we moved . Had to use a wadded up paper towel to level my filter . Was thrilled to see a leveling device while browsing . However , I now know how I lost my original ... it wo n't stay in ! I 'm back to using the wadded up paper towel	-1
my betta did n't like at all ... .he just looked at it and swam away ... .i fed it to the gold fish in my pond ... they eat anything and they were n't impressed either .	-1
I got this one and a blue hose from another buyer.The blue hose was perfect , this one is absolutely useless to me.Does not fit on either the tetra 10 or 40 air pump ! Buyer beware ! You 're in for a scare !	-1
This tubing was much more narrow than any other aquarium tubing that I currently have . It would n't work with any of the three air pumps that I have no matter how much I stretched it . Other than that it seems fine - flexible , seems tough and not brittle . But when a product says & # 34 ; standard & # 34 ; and then does n't work with any of my pumps I think that 's a bit deceptive . Looking at the other reviews as well I think whoever is packaging this is just selling whatever tubing they happen to have spools of at the moment .	-1
This tubing is way to small to attach other things to . You can try soaking it in boiling water , but it did no good for me . After stretching , complaining and muscle I finally got it attached to my whisper pump and a valve , but I could not attach the washback valve ( I bought 5 ) . Send a little more money and get a more flexible tubing so you can work with it .	-1
This airline is too stiff and it does not fit other air accessories nipples without really forcing it on with pliers	-1
After reading the good reviews of the Booda perch I placed an order for one ... ... ..what I received was an Aspenpet brand perch . I wanted the Booda brand as all the reviews for other cloth perches were not that great ... ... I looked all over the cardboard information that is around the perch and no where on it is the brand name Booda ... ... .I will use it & try it but it is NOT WHAT I ORDERED ! ! ! ! ! ! The only thing the description said was COLOR may vary NOT brand ! ! ! Did arrive on time and packaging was perfect .	-1
Got this because of the near perfect reviews . I was disappointed . The only good thing I can say about this product is that it is very quiet . I wanted to cut down on clutter and reduce the amount of air pumps on my 5 tanks . Figured I could run numerous air stones and bubble wands off of this . It can run one bubble wand or air stone fantastically . It will run 2 ok with a noted reduction in bubbles . Add any more than that and the bubbles are reduced to a mere trickle . I set this up 2 different ways to see it was my set up or the item . First try was with gang valves . Second try was with all hoses connected with connector tee 's . Same problem with both set ups . So , sadly , this item is being used on a single bubble wand . I am now using another brand of pump instead of this to run 8 air stones in 4 separate tanks with no problem at all .	-1
I bought this item on March 29 , 2013 Based on research and reviews that I found , This is one of the best pumps in the market today . , I used it on around April 19 , Excited of setting up for my 75 gal tank . This pump was attached to a ViaAqua 12 inch 2.7 watt Slow Color Changing LED Light & Airstone . It was a perfect match because the pump works great ... `` for almost a week '' . On April 22 , I started to hear a loud vibration and noise in the pump . Motor or diaphragm I contacted the seller and followed protocol , Seller Name is `` OZBO '' says `` IF IT 'S PUMPING AIR , THEN IT 'S FUNCTIONING '' , If I have concerns about how it operates please contact the manufacturer . word per word . I think that 's a `` bull '' . Good thing I reported to Amazon of the rudeness , they gave me what I need , Attention . They solved my dilemma by taking care of everything for me . Thanks Amazon . Anyways , i 'm still on the hunt for a better product/replacement but definitely going for another brand , I guess the name whisperer is not the right name for this . Now I have My Fluval Q2 .	-1
i had two tetra 60 ( 60 gallon rating ) and wanted to get a stronger one . got this and this one is weaker than the 60 ! the 60 outperformed this ( rated 150 gallons ! ) on the 55 and 20 gallon tank ! so i now have two tetra 60 powering a gang valve supplying 4 airlines total to a 29 and 55 gallon tank . the 150 is left to work on the 20 gallon tank ! save money and get the tetra 60 instead !	-1
They do n't eat them well . I bought for an easier way to get calcium in their system and it seems that they spit them out often . I know baby 's are n't suppose to have pellets as a big part of their diet , but they hardly eat them at all .	-1
Never buy it again ! ! ! It did n't low PH in my tank and water became yellow . Try RO water from water store , it is effective way to low PH in a few minutes .	-1
I was happy to order this product . It got here quick . Saddly after 5 minutes the pump blew . I called pondmaster who refused to honor the warrenty due to the amount of rebuilt equipment comming from sellers on Amazon and Ebay . The seller has said they will return the money and refused to exchange for another product . I paid $ 10 for return shipping ( wich will not be refunded to me ) and still no word from the seller . I have had to call Amazon to make sure I get my money back . All I can say is BUYER BEWARE ! ! ! ! ! !	-1
I purchased this thru Amazon about 3-4 months ago ... .and it suddenly quit.Worked great until then . Not sure who to contact ... ... UPDATE : Contacting the company and found out that Amazon is not a `` designated distributor '' for their product so they wo n't take it back ! ! I tried to take apart the pump as per their suggestion and found out the pump impeller was Broken ! ... .and the whole thing is now good as a door stop.I do n't have the money to waste.And this was definitely a BIG WASTE .	-1
So far this pump/filter setup has worked for me . My pond is 8x10 and 2 1/2 feet at its deepest and 1 foot at the lowest . The pump has been running none stop for 2 weeks now and I have not experienced any issues . The filter that came with it is good , it does the job of filtering and it is also easy to clean.Edit : I have now changed my review to 2 stars . After just a little over 2 months of off and on use the pump has stopped working . I thought it might have been clogged but when I took it out of my pond it was clean and no excessive debris was in the filter . If you are look for a pump to run continuously then stay away from this one .	-1
I put this 5 1/2 '' wand in my tank a little over a month ago . Now only half of the bar produces bubbles . It was great while it lasted but if I have to replace it every time I clean my 55 gal tank , it will be too expensive . I will have to look for other brands . Most of the Penn Plax Air stone I have bought lately just do n't last long . They are made in China so what I bought maybe counterfeit or they just are n't making good quality anymore . It seems that the pet stores around me only carry this brand and I think one other . Not much to choose from .	-1
This is junk . I have a video to prove it . I am using a large air pump with it and nothing works . Getting 12 streams of bubbles and this stone is huge . Just terrible .	-1
Only half of it works and it is on a 60 gallon air pump in a 20 gallon tank.wtf do not buy	-1
Will only pump air about 3 inches under water , then the pressure becomes too much.Batteries are loose so if you shake it it will turn on and off.very short power ( 3 feet max if not 2 feet ) cord makes it obnoxious to set up on a fish tank . Has a clip on the back that will not fit on anything you 'd have on our around your aquarium , so difficult to mount or put anywhere.It does what it is supposed to do though , which is turn on when the power goes out . I have mine so the tube is 1 inch under water so itll break surface tension in the case of power outage . Very cheaply does what it says it will .	-1
I have seen this kind of air disks in use , and thought I would try one out . Well never again ! This one lasted a week , and the blue grit fell out into my tank . I know my Tilapia are feisty , but they did n't do that . & # 128512 ; Just not a good product .	-1
Not good , bulky and air only comes out certain sides , not all around . Like the long stick air stones better . This thing is heavier and takes up more bottom tank space than an elongated shape .	-1
Stone is too big and makes too many big bubbles . I used it for a week . Try something else .	-1
I put it in my fish tank and it has great bubbles ( so far ) . My problem is , that it will not stay on the floor of the tank . I have tried weighing it down using extra connection tubing and gravel , but it still wants to float . I also tried reducing the air flow to almost nothing , but that did not work either . I ended up wedging it behind a large intake tube to keep it from floating to the top of the tank . I like the bubbles but , I do n't like the fact that it will not stay on the bottom gravel bed .	-1
All I got out of this lousy product were huge bubbles out of three locations on this piece of junk . Whatever happened to a mist of bubbles like I wanted . I bought a much cheaper airstone that really delivered the goods . I 'm just going to keep this bubble disk as an emergency ornament ( if that means anything ) . I would n't recommend this product to anyone .	-1
You 're probably looking at this product because you are looking for a good , cheap air stone . Well , these are definitely cheap . I had my reservations when I saw how much green & # 34 ; sand & # 34 ; was loose in the packaging blister . They continued to crumble and flake as I put the tubing on . I had to pull the tubing off of one to make a length adjustment , and the plastic nipple popped right out of the stone and is not repairable.The ones that did not break do work , but the bubbles are much larger than other stones . They & # 34 ; hog & # 34 ; the air from my denser air stones . If you are going to plug in multiple items into your airline , these will use a disproportionate amount of your air.The price was very cheap , but the quality is equally so . I definitely suggest looking elsewhere .	-1
Bubbles are too big.In addition , these stones break easily . When I tried to remove it , it broke ! I was very gentle ! ! Huge disappointment . I would not buy them anymore .	-1
Should had read the other reviews before ordering.Upon opening my package I found a filter cartridge set that did not even remotely resemble what I ordered or the ones in the picture . Instead I received `` Carbon/floss filter cartridges '' which are tube like and small . How does someone mix that up ? I could have just picked up the filters at the store but now I need to repackage the item , go to the post office , and then to the store anyway ( not going to order these here again ) . Bad service .	-1
I works , but considering the price it 's noisy . I bought a much cheaper one and it 's quieter .	-1
Worked good on my 20 gallon tank for a year or two , but the cord area going into the unit had the plastic covering rub or break off and I did n't realize it at first . I got a slight charge everytime I put my hands into the water ! Not terrible ; similar to a strong static charge ! But I do n't like getting zapped LoLI rarely moved it once I got it in place , so I 'm not sure how the plastic covering exposed the wire .	-1
to really get crap out of tubing the brush could stand to b a bit less soft . It does flex well to get thru tubing but If your trying to get coralline off it 's not very effective unless you soak whatever in a strong vinegar bath for a good while first . Takes a bit of scrubbing for algae too ! I also had the brush come off also inside my protein skimmer ... luckily I could get some tweezers in the hole & pull it out ! I got it screwed back in tight but now do n't trust it as much ! To those that had trouble w/the brush coming off , if u just twist it back into the wire tubing it goes right back ! Just tighten it REALLY hard & it 'll stay ! I 've done that after it came off & it 's been fine ! Still needs to b a bit less wimpy of a brush though ! !	-1
Just like another reviewer , this brush broke within my first 2 minutes of use . It got hung up , just a little snag , barely pulled on it , and the whole brush head popped right off . And it broke right off , inside my canister filter hose , so it was a pain in the *** to get out of there . It was a shame too , because the handle on this thing is great !	-1
Works ok as a floss to put in front of biomedia and then replace a couple times a week . However , quilt batting works just as well and it is cheaper . ( you can get a big roll at a craft store or walmart.. ) This product itself is not strong enough to work as a bio-filter and grow beneficial bacteria for a cycled tank . The pad I cut for the filter fell apart after a couple weeks . When it accumulates waste it shrinks . I lost the bb in one tank and had an ammonia spike . I ca n't say that this media caused the problem , but I replaced it with another brand . ( The Fluval foam pads that I 'm using have lasted 12 months ) . I leave the Fluval pads in the filter to hold the beneficial bacteria . I cut pieces of cheap quilt batting and use it as floss in front of the Fluval pad to catch waste , replacing the batting it as needed , usually twice a week . A roll of quilt batting will last months . I have 4 tanks.While this product works ok as floss , I have other found other options that work better for me and are more economical .	-1
There is a vast amount of filtration media to use in HOB filters . You 'll spend less time doing maintenance & save money . More bangFor your buck .	-1
I have no idea why I get this hay from walmart and its bad quality , I get the SAME product from a pet store and it great . My guinea pig does n't this hay ... its like not even hay , it 's more like straw . My guinea pig eats very little of this , so I have to give him a bunch of it so he can pick through it .	-1
Kaytee is by and far one of the laziest manufacturers of pet products I 've encountered . I work at a pet store , and have had ferrets in one of their cages that hated every second , and a guinea pig that hated their food and hay . Their cages are poorly designed , their hay is unhealthy and dry and lacking a lot of the proper nutrients , and they are , in my experience , generally all-around awful . KMS is the best you can get aside from straight from a farm , though Oxbow is good , too . Whatever you do , do n't go with Kaytee . Treat your pets right !	-1
and the last 2 have had lots of brown dried up hay in them , so I 'm not real happy with that . Am going to use up what I have and either hit a local farm store and buy hay from them , or switching over to Oxbow if that 's not an option .	-1
I bought this hay for a year because I could pick it up at Wal Mart , I could subscribe to it on Amazon , and I thought it was reasonably priced . After finding a local feed store and searching further on Amazon , I feel that I have found the light.Kaytee brand hay is full of dust and tiny pieces that end up being wasted rather than consumed and creating a big mess if your animal lives inside.Not only is it cheaper per oz to buy in bulk , feed store hay ( or even Standlee Premium Western Forage that can be purchased through Amazon ) is WAY better quality that you can see , and that your animals will prefer .	-1
Does n't say anywhere in the instruction that it may be harmful , but it killed my BN pleco . I did the research afterward that I should have done in the first place and found that this is a common complaint . My low rating is because it should have a warning about the risk to those kinds of fish , not just invertebrates and plants . The tank did n't have ich , I was just using it as a preventative .	-1
First off I 'll explain I 'm not new to the aquarium hobby and I 've used many different medications with awesome success and results . I read the reviews on I 'm here and someone on a fish forum suggested that this product is safe to use this product in a planted tank with live plants and snails to cure ick . I followed the advice and regret it . This product killed my two expensive Discus Fish and stressed out the rest of them along with the snails . The plants barely pulled through and the ick still lives . Carbon does n't remove this product you have to buy another product to remove it or do 100 % water changes which still leaves residue of copper in the tank . Ugh ! What a mess . Never again . I finally got the copper out with 100 % water change and using seachem Cuprisorb and tested the water using API copper test . I have never in the past killed a fish by medicating it . I knew something was wrong when the fish starting suffocating at the surface of the tank because this product reduces oxygen in the tank . ( it would have been nice if the manufacturer stated this on the label ) even after I increased oxygen levels in the tank the fish were so stressed out that 2 fish could n't pull through . Luckily the snails sort of bounced back . Finally starting to come out of their shells . If you dare risk the life of your fish by using this product pull out your wallet and plan to spend the extra cash on copper remover and a good copper test kit . Oh also any filter or foam that 's in your filter or in my case the canister filer the copper will stick to it and clog it reducing water flow . ( Also not on the directions or packagjng ) you 'll have to service your filter everyday . For some reason the chemicals bond and stick to these types of filter . There are safer products to use that sure ick and way cheaper than this . I 've have pretty good luck using rid ick plus . Anyway this was my experience . Sticking to what I know that works . Oh and it does n't tell you on the label how to get this stuff out the water either . Really ? ?	-1
got this for our tiny puppy and he just does n't really care enough to chew on it . Definitely not one of his favorite toys that i have purchased for him . Maybe in time when he gets older .	-1
I do n't really know how the solar snowflakes are until next christmas . the nala bone has sharp edges when my dog chews it . He is a pittbull/lab so he really chews . I would like to find a bone that he wo n't destroy . please let me know if you have anything like that .	-1
My adult German Shepherd destroys things quickly as all GSD like to do . My vet recommended the Nylabone as it was supposed to be good for her teeth , so I got one , but it ended up chipping off about half of one of her little front teeth . In addition , once some chewing has occurred , the bone gets a lot of hard , sharp jagged edges that can cut both the dog 's gums and my hands.It is definitely durable and my dog loved to chew on it , but I 'd rather spend more money and have her go through a bunch of softer chew toys than to find more broken teeth . Also worth noting is that a different reviewer also mentioned a broken tooth .	-1
If you go by the company 's recommendation in sizing , the petite should have been right for my 11 # dog . It is too small . I took it away as I was afraid she would choke on it . I bought a regular size at a pet shop , and it is much safer for her .	-1
I have what I would consider a pretty tough chewer . She destroys most things in a matter of minutes , but she hates this bone . By the way it sounds when she does attempt to chew it , it would be like chewing on a rock . I really wish I could find something in between the Dura Chew and the Flex Chew .	-1
I guess I 'm in the minority . I had heard that these were a problem and shrugged off the warning as one from the few malcontents having a bad day and bought this . Good chewing BUT ... ..they made my dog sick and he barfed five times . And guess what came up ? And , yes , the sharp little edges were still there . No more nylabone products for me . mb	-1
I got this for a dog who is a strong chewer and was destroying all the toys he was given . The dog chewed it a little bit , but for the most part ignores it . I 've tried freezing peanut butter spread on it to get him interested in it , but even then he just gets the peanut butter off and leaves the bone alone . Its a nice sized bone and it was priced good on Amazon compared to my local pet stores , so its a shame the dog did n't like it . I thought about trying other flavors of Nylabones , but I was afraid the dog would n't like those either and I ended up just buying some more Kongs .	-1
Our 2 year old retriever/shepherd mix has loved Nylabone 's products since she was a puppy.I thought they were great ; they never upset her sensitive stomach ( passed harmlessly ) , did n't split or splinter , and I always thought they were at least soft enough to not cause dental damage . Every 6 months or so , we 'd just replace it as it wore down and became gross.Unfortunately , she just broke an incisor on one last night.I 'm pretty shocked . Her teeth are perfectly healthy . She 's an active chewer , but never chews for more than 15-20 minutes several times a day.I honestly would n't have believed it was the Nylabone that caused it if I had n't seen it happen.Your mileage may vary , but seriously consider if it 's worth the vet bills .	-1
I just adopted a 3 year old pit bull and thought this would be perfect . She would n't even chew it once . Like I handed her a brick . I dunno , some dogs like 'em I guess . Good for them . I 've never had a dog that really chewed these .	-1
My cocker spaniel will chew the Nylabone a little bit . She 's not crazy about it . Maybe it 's because I bought the `` souper size . '' I did n't know they came in different sizes and the package in the store did n't indicate the recommended size of dog . She 's twenty pounds . It does n't look too big for her . She can get her mouth around it , but maybe she 'd like it more if it was a little bit smaller . Right now , she does n't like it too much at all .	-1
My dog was able to break this in two . He 's a 1 year old lab , and not a super aggressive chewer .	-1
When it says do n't leave dogs unattended with this bone they mean it . It also says do n't allow them to ingest pieces larger then rice or something like that ... they mean that too . My 18 month old Pit was loving this bone and I tried to take every piece that she chewed off away from her as it came off . A few pieces must have got past me and in her tummy and on the floor , because she started having violent vomiting a day latter , then our 8 year old pit started doing the same . We were for sure that we had got some Chinese chicken strips or something then we started going through the vomit ( sick what we do for our kids ) and found Nylabone chunks in both dogs vomit . Have n't had a issue since . My husband has banned any product from this company from entering our house again.Buyer beware and watch your dogs .	-1
With the price of this you 'd be better off giving your dog a piece PVC pipe to chew ! My dogs are just not interested in it !	-1
Our pup 's normally love these bones . But really do not seem to show any interest in this one at all . I am very disappointed and feel perhaps its the flavor or lack of flavor that is the problem .	-1
It says this will fit my powerhead ( from the same company ) , but I seriously just ca n't figure out how . I have tried every modification possible and have looked at diagrams online and on the directions included , and googled , and youtubed . Nothing ... So its just sitting in my cabinet waiting for a magical hand to make it fit on there .	-1
Very disappointed in this product . I 'll give you the pros and cons . PROS : None ! CONS : Everything about it ... 1 ) It falls apart way too easy . You have to triple check that it is screwed together properly and even then , after you are sure it 's screwed together properly , half the time it still falls apart . 2 ) It falls off the power head very easily . You have to attach it to the power head after the power head is positioned in the tank and even then it falls off half the time . 3 ) It Does polish the water and filter stuff out , then again , it does NOT ! Let me explain : It will polish the water nicely . You can see it eagerly sucking in little bits of debris . Only one problem ... when you are done with it , 90 % of everything it sucked up dislodges as soon as you touch it when you want to remove it from the tank . So all the gunk you just polished from the tank is now floating in your tank again ! ! ! So bottom line is , it is utterly useless .	-1
I thought that this would be good but wow , this thing is huge . Might be good for a 100 gallon setup , but in my 50 gallon this huge cylinder looks gaudy , and takes up way too much space , it measures 7 '' tall and almost 3 '' in diameter Also Mine showed on the box a attachment to adapt to my aquclear 20 powerhead , well no such adaptor making this USELESS . It will fit a aquaclear 50 PH or above but not good for the 20s or 30 models . Not worth returning seeing cost of shipping outweighs the items worth . oh well to the trash it goes . And to add to that its cheep plastic construction . I am sorry I ever bought this	-1
First of all , it does n't fit an aquaclear 70 ( or anything smaller ) out of box . I had to put a sponge filter on the tube to keep it snuggly fit ( this thing is quite large ) . The filter pad it is packed with is garbage . Most particles sit on the surface , and when it clogs ( which it did quickly , completely cutting off the flow from my filter one night ) removing it drops everything back into the tank . I did try to rinse out the filter pad bit , but after one use it was already starting to break apart . I ended up throwing the filter part , and the exterior black casing away , and am now just using the plastic shell that was inside as a means of preventing my cherry shrimp from getting sucked up the tube . So , spend 12-ish dollars for what must be at best a 50 cent piece of plastic on the inside if you feel like it .	-1
They should post the length of this and the length of the power heads because together , they were too long for my tank .	-1
I have a sand substrate and I 'm not sure if its letting the nutrients get to the roots . Dont get me wrong the plants are growing but it seems like the Excel has more to do with that than the Leaf Zone . Plants dont look very strong , I wouldnt recomend for use with sand beds .	-1
I put these white diamond ammonia crystals in my wet/dry trickle filter . Previously I had been using zeolite for ammonia removal . The zeolite was working ok , but I am always looking for something better . I rinsed then put the white diamond crystals in my filter before I went to bed . When I got up , you could barely see my fish ! I was not sure what caused the cloudiness until i tested the white diamond crystals . I put 1 cup of the crystals that had already been in the filter into a tea strainer . Then I proceeded to pour a cup of distilled water through it . The water came out super cloudy . It looked like someone had put milk in the glass , then poured it out and filled it with water . As far as how good it works for ammonia removal , I can not say . I have removed it from my filter and will not be using it any more . My advice is stick with the zeolite and do your water changes .	-1
Really ? I got this because the good bacteria in my tanks all died off at once due to a friend helping out and over zealously cleaning all my filters at one time . Well , I had to re-cycle the tanks and of course during this time the ammonia sky rocketed . I got this product in an attempt to control the ammonia as the tanks cycled . Sorry , this product did absolutely nothing . It may remove ammonia but certainly not large amounts nor small amounts from what I could see . I can only assume it removes trace amounts . I ended up using a liquid ammonia lock instead . Maybe I 'll sprinkle what I have left in the kitty litter box .	-1
I could n't bring myself to put this crap in my tank . I just got some biomax & called it a day . Depending on that & my bio - wheels	-1
Was hoping to control ammonia levels a bit better with this . Even when using a lot of this in my canister filter , the ammonia levels are not decreased or controlled at all . I see no difference than using plain carbon . I probably wo n't buy again , and I 'll just stick to the activated carbon as before .	-1
Let me start by saying I love maxijet pumps . However these newer ones are now made in China . This may or may not make a difference to some people but here is the issue I came across . I use this pump to feed a reactor for my fishtank . Normally I use a ball valve to throttle down the flow to keep my carbon from grinding itself down to powder . With the old style pump this was no problem , I could dial it back and it would work as quietly as it did unrestricted . With the new style pump made in China the machining process must be a little more laxed or something as ANY back pressure at all makes these pumps rattle horribly ! Be aware of this issue if you plan on using this pump to feed a reactor , or skimmer or anything else that might cause some back pressure . The noise will drive you crazy !	-1
Did not like them at all . No good quality , so the price was much to high for this type of cat toy .	-1
Do not use this product on Betta . I used it and it killed mine.Use the blue stuff , it 's called & # 34 ; Mardel & # 34 ; quick cure if you do n't want to stress your fish out.I tried it on my guppies and they did n't seem to mind it .	-1
My guppies started to show signs of distress after several days of using this medication . After several more days , a few of them died . I immediately started emergency water changes and filtration . After about a week , everything is stabilized now.After doing some research on the ingredient found in this product , it is only effective against bacteria not very common to fish tanks , which means its effectiveness is very limited . Also , according to reports on this tea ingredient , if taken internally , it can be very toxic to humans . If fish are placed in a solution of this , even if it is diluted , it is no wonder that some aquarium keepers are reporting fish dying from this product.This may not happen to everyone , but it did to me and for this reason , I can not recommend this product to anyone because of the potential hazard of fish dying.A few of my guppies had a small case of fin rot , and I thought I would try Metaffix out on them , but the results were not satisfactory at all . My water in the tank is good and has a ph of 7.2 , with zero ammonia and zero nitrite levels.Perhaps API has changed this formula or has had bad batches of this stuff released . But in any event , I wo n't be buying this medication again .	-1
This item did n't do the job . It did n't smell like the previous bottles I received and it did n't help the fishes to regrow . I always use it in combination with the pimafix and was not satisfied at all . Both fish died of the fungus .	-1
The dose on the bottle is extremely misleading.I tried to repair the fin of my green terror so I dose the tank half the dose recommended on the bottle.There is a large fire eel in the tank.Five minutes after I dose the tank , the fire eel started getting agitated and came out of his hiding place and swam around looking for opening on the surface of the tank as if trying to jump out.That was a tell tale sign but I did not think to much of it so I went out to run errand for an hour.When I came back an hour later , the fire eel is dead laying on the floor of the aquarium ! ! ! ! That 's how fast this melafix can kill your fish ! Prior to this , the eel is healthy as any happy , normal swimming creature.This is not the first time the melafix killed my fish , whether they were ill or not.I always lost my fishes when I tried to treat them using melafix when they were ill.Stay away from Pimafix as well.These two are fish killers.I alwaya used at most half the recommended dose because I was worry about the potency of the dose and it was enough to effectively kill my fishes.Needless to say these two blue bottles are now in my trash can.Do n't use these poisons if you value your precious swim mates .	-1
the item came dried out and hard ... my bird would not eat it as it was too hard . not sure way this was as date said it was good till 2015 ? ? ? ? ?	-1
Looked like a good deal . When I received the filter in its box I thought the item was missing . What I thought was packing material was the filters - 2-6x6 black sheets of foam . The Ad pic shows 3 ( 2 black and 1 white ) and says pack of 2 . Do n't think this is worth it , consider another product and company . Major rip-off .	-1
Good for what it does , basically a dechlorinator . There are tons of these on the market , some with additional benefits ... For the price , I just ca n't justify buying this anymore . Again , there are many other conditioners ( some by seachem ) that dechlorinate and much more . Depending on your setup , I might recommend Neutral Regulator for hard water , or even a basic Aquasafe conditioner .	-1
I purchased one of these to try with my strip temperature gauges on my 90 gallon saltwater reef system . Thankfully it was a cheap mistake.The thermometer does n't like to stick to the glass ( which I cleaned very carefully to make sure there were no lingering algae deposits ) and is easily knocked off by invertebrates and other creatures in your tank . Then you have to fish it out and stick it back up on the glass again.It reads poorly compared to most strips ; I compared it with them side by side to see if one was easier to read than the other . It also reads slower than strip thermometers ( I tested it in an empty quarantine tank by raising the internal water temperature and the outside temperature strip registered the change faster ) .I left it in the quarantine tank with normal reef salinity and gravity for a week and found it clouded . This is concerning if you are keeping coral as it could be leaking or subject to breaking in the tank . Not to be dissuaded that it might be one bad thermometer I purchased another and it suffered the same fate within the same time frame ( it lasted a whole day longer ) .I 'm giving this a two star review because it may work in fresh water and be effective there but I would n't suggest it for a saltwater system . If you do n't like thermometer strips you might as well spend the money on an expensive electronic reader that will also run a few of your tests for you .	-1
I think there are better quality yogurt chips out there ( Vitakraft ) I know it is n't really healthy snack for bunnies , but this is like my secret weapon to befriend with new bunny ... This one has partially hydrogenated soybean oil , palm oil ... just too much extra stuff : ( And I 'm not sure if my bunny actually needs all these vitamins and minerals ( iron , chloride , vitamin A , B12 , E ... .. ) So I try not to give this to my bun ... I might get infant 's yogurt chips instead in the future .	-1
I was excited to use this , but I have found it useless in removing algae from my freshwater tank glass . In addition , it picks up gravel and scratches the tank glass .	-1
I used this product several times after I received it , and fount out it is not so good at cleaning algae from fish tank glass , in general . I went back to old fashion stick and sponge . You do not need to get your hands wet if you have a long stick . On the other hand , you will always get your hands wet using Mag Float Cleaner . But the bottom line is that this is not doing a good job cleaning .	-1
Probably does the job , but at the same time I 've lost a number of fish since I started using it.Will likely return to using Top Fin , as it does n't stink of sulfur , and I feel more confident with it .	-1
Was misinformed about what the product really was - I needed a comprehensive fertilizer , not a liquid carbon supplement . I need to add an extra word , so this is it .	-1
I am fairly new to having live plants in my tank and have been reading lots and learning a ton but the more I read the more difficult I realize these live plants can be . I sure appreciate our natural ecosystems a lot more , they are really hard to duplicate outside of nature without doing lots of research and spending some money . I 'm often amazed nature works , after trying to replicate it in my tank . I refuse to use a $ 300+ CO2 tank injection system that if I screw up even slightly will kill all of my fish . I have grown plastic plants for a few years now in my aquariums , with no problems : ) I upgraded to live plants in hopes this would look better and reduce my water changes by absorbing some of the nitrates . My plants started struggling a month after bringing them home from the fish store.I have good lights that I upgraded ( $ $ $ ) before bringing home the plants , so I then thought it was a fertilizer problem when the plants started to struggle . I started with liquid fertilizers then realized they would get expensive and switched . Now I fertilize daily using the PPS Pro system with dry macro and trace fertilizers . That helped a little but not much , so then I decided that unfortunately CO2 was the only thing left.I did more research and when using the KH / PH CO2 table lookup I have almost non existent CO2 in my tank ( about 2-3PPM , but should be around 15 I believe ) . So after some research I decided to try Excel . I knew the carbon in Excel was n't as good as actual CO2 but thought I 'd try . I have been using Excel now for 1 month and have n't seen any improvement in my stunted plant growth . I think in a very CO2 deficient tank like mine , Excel just is n't enough to do the job.I do like how it helps with algae , although I do n't struggle with algae much . I really needed it for the carbon more so than algae control , and the advertised use is for carbon addition not algae control.Another positive note ... While the main ingredient in Excel is a pretty nasty chemical after doing research ( do n't inhale the fumes , wash your hands etc ) I have Ghost Shrimp and they have been fine with the Excel . I saw some of the reviews that said Excel killed their shrimp . I would suggest that maybe those people did the math wrong and accidentally overdosed the tank . or tried to use the threads in the cap as a guide which is nearly impossible to pour accurately . An accidental overdose of this chemical definitely would kill shrimp . I use a syringe to make sure my daily dose is exact.So , now after wasting all this time and hundreds of dollars trying Excel , fertilizers , upgrading lights etc , I might give the Hagen Nutrafin CO2 system a whirl since its not a tank system and is cheap to try . Plus it is less likely I can screw it up and kill my fish . But , if that does n't work or is too much hassle , I may just give up and go back to plastic plants . Who knew live plants added such a level of complexity and expense for a beginner ? I guess many people know that , but I sure did n't . Anyhow , Excel does n't cut it for a highly C02 deficient tank from what I can tell . I wish it had worked for simplicity sake , I 'll still keep some around for algae control emergencies though ... .	-1
I got this a few weeks ago and it still is n't working . I put one cap in my tank everyday since it says one cap per 50gallons of water ( i have a 55g ) . Still my plants are n't looking good . They are green but have brown and yellow spots and leaves . Also since iv used this my tank is very cloudy . Done with this , will try nutrafin 's plant growth .	-1
These are nothing special , can get the same thing from the rings from milk bottles.My cat was not impressed with these ... .	-1
Our two 1 yr old cats did n't like them . And neither did our older cats . The young ones batted them once and walked away . The older one just watched ( and he does play ! ) .	-1
I thought these would be good , my cats love milk rings but chew on them so they are not safe , these do n't get chewed so much but they do break , I stepped on one with my slippers on and it broke .	-1
Why did you drop this on the floor ? What is it ? Who cares ? I guess kitty is allowed to have her preferences and this is not one .	-1
My two year old cats love the spring toys and will pick them up and carry them around all over the place . Naturally when I saw these I thought they might like them as well . WRONG ! They batted them around for about thirty seconds and then walked away . They have been laying in the same place for a couple of weeks now . I have tried to engage them with these toys and it is a no-go . Another note : the springs get strewn all over the house and even in bare feet do n't hurt when you step on them but these toys HURT if you accidentally step on one barefooted . The ones I purchased are going to a friend with two cats to see if hers will play with them .	-1
My cats did n't go for these . I think because they do n't move on their own . The cat springs are much preferable as they move continuously when the cat takes a swat at them .	-1
Save your money for other toys . Cut up a paper towel roll into about 1/2 pieces . Your cat will love it and when you step on it , you wo n't hurt your foot !	-1
My cats did n't find these cat crazies interesting . They ignored them . Maybe they are not young enough to enjoy this toy .	-1
Truthfully my cat like the milk carton rings better . Thought these would be a good substitute , but not . She batted them around a little and that was it .	-1
~ BUY THESE INSTEAD FOR $ 1.46B000CMKHDGHad I got these for dollar instead of $ 5 . I would have given 5 stars but these are honestly 4 pieces of very cheap plastic .	-1
Boo hoo ... I have the toughest kitty critic in the world . Alex was solely unimpressed by the Cat Crazies . He was like , & # 34 ; What ? You want me to play with that ? I 'd rather have you step on it and shriek in horrific pain ! That would amuse me more. & # 34 ; Alex prefers the spring toys that are for sale on Amazon . He takes them into the shower and/or bathroom at night to practice his kitty hunting skills , and especially to keep me awake nights . ( What he does n't know is , I find the fact that he is entertaining himself very , very soothing . It means that he is not pawing with one claw at my lip to let me know he is bored . Shhhh . Do n't think about this too loudly . I 'm pretty sure Alex is telepathic , too . ) And , I can step barefoot on the spring toys and not notice , except for the & # 34 ; crunching & # 34 ; sound ... but they do n't break.I continue in my quest for the Best Cat Toy EVER .	-1
My cats ignored this cat toy , I went by the reviews , I have two kittens who will play with anything and everything but this toy was not one they liked or even knew what to do with.Every cat is different but I guess I was n't sure what to do with this cat toy either .	-1
This thing is so stupid I would be embarrassed to let my friends know I even tried to use it .	-1
I have to reset the top of the skimmer part every day to allow it to float on the top of the water and then within 24 hours usually it has sunk down so the whole thing is underwater again and no longer skimming the surface as intended . also you need to have a cut-out on the hood to allow the adjustment knob to stick through unless you have your top water level about 2 & # 34 ; down from the top . I like the water level to be above the plastic band of the top of the aquarium so you dont see the water level when viewing .	-1
We previously we had this model ( the Petmate Deluxe Fresh Flow ) for about 2 years . The motor ran well and it never broke , so I gave the fountain itself a review of 2 stars . But these filters are terrible in comparison to the design of the Drinkwell Platinum fountain.Drinkwell Platinum Pet FountainandDrinkwell Premium Replacement Filter Cartridges ( 3-Pack ) The newer Drinkwell 's filters are designed SO much better ( 6 tightly divided coal sections ) . The fabric used in the Petmate 's filter loosely holds the coal and so the coal clumps down at the bottom . The water easily flows up and over the coal , and does not get filtered ( I believe the coal is divided into 2 sections ... its been a couple of weeks since I tossed the whole product ) .I would recommend paying the extra $ 20 and going for the Drinkwell Platinum and staying away from this old model and its poorly designed filters .	-1
I have two of these and they both have become clogged , I haved tried soaking them in everything from vinegar to hydro peroxide ... barely any bubbles and it actually fouled up my pump because no air was getting through . Nice idea and design I just wish they would produce for longer than a month .	-1
I fail to see how something could be broken right out of the box , especially when it 's a hose with holes in it . Basically no air was getting though . Since I ca n't really return a wet , broken item , I cut the end off with scissors and shoved my air tubing into the end and just threw out the nozzle thing on the diffuser . It works now , I guess . At least it works well enough that it 's not going directly into the trash , at least not yet . Pretty disappointing that something that essentially is supposed to leak , did n't .	-1
What happened to the quality of Carefresh ? I have been repeatedly buying Carefresh directly from Petco for more than three years . In 2010 I switched to use fleece for my guinea pigs ' bedding and now I am back to paper-based bedding , I ordered 12 of 50 liter bags in two orders . They are totally different products from what I used to use.They all smell like garbage and texture is really coarse . I feel the roughness is bothering my pigs ' tender feet . They are dingy gray brown in color , which is much darker than before . It can control pee smell , but it gives out that dried garbage smell.I need to find alternatives since Carefresh 's quality decreased so much . Very disappointed .	-1
Our rabbit does not like this stuff at all . When I put this in her litter box she immediately roots it out . She will kick it all over the pen . Anywhere but her litter box I guess . I wont be buying this again . But on a positive note it does absorb the urine ( when the rabbit leaves some of it in box that is )	-1
This did not stop odor and my pets wanted to eat it . I have been told that if a pet eats this the product could expand and hurt the animal .	-1
Ive used a lot of this with my pigs . The advantage is no dust . The disadvantges include the smell of the material itself which is somewhat like newsprint and that it has no drying action on the little poos . If you feed spinach even once a day you will get a lot of 'beans ' and in this bedding those beans do not dry out , , and then they smell in less than a week . A bit expensive to change out the entire pen twice a week . The kaytee granules are far better .	-1
This stuff is not too bad or good . I have used it for 5 years for my first guinea pig and now with my new little piggy . This stuff smells weird in a bad way , right out of the package . It does not help much with the animal odors either . I change the cage every week and on that last day it smells really bad . I also use a lot of this stuff for a thick bed layer ( 3 inches ) and it 's expensive . I will retire this stuff and look for a cheaper alternative .	-1
Not sure why this did not work for me . All water parameters were excellent ( ergo not a bacteria issue ) . Wound up doing large water change to clear things up .	-1
Contrary to the reviews written about how this garlic guard will make even the unappetizing fish food desirable to any kind of fish.I soaked the pellets in this garlic liquid and drop them into the tank . But guess what , the fish swam away from the soaked pellets like they 're escaping the plague.Major fail . And I still have a full bottle of this thing to waste .	-1
We had to run to a pet store right before Christmas to buy a replacement . The one we purchased was constructed of thicker plastic . The one I received had a vertical crack through one of the large walls . I had to toss it but with Amazons great policy , I was n't charged for the damaged product .	-1
I 've known several people who ONLY use this type of lamp because of the great value . Having 7 reptiles , we do go through bulbs . I find this lamp to be far lower quality as compared with others , and to not last as long . To increase product life , definitely do n't touch the bulb when you install it ( like a halogen there ) or it 'll burn out . Use a kleenex or oil-free cloth . One month I had 7 of these bulbs burn out in my different tanks less than a week after installation . Not very promising . Even when they do last , they do n't last AS long as other products . Recently , I have just chosen to go with the incandescent blue bulbs ... they last a lot longer and are far less fragile , although they do n't `` direct '' the light as well .	-1
These bulbs are much cheaper than at the pet store . They look good and they work at first.In about 5 days the first one burned out . I could hear the loose filament shaking in the bulb.I looked for a warranty . There was n't any . Caveat Emptor .	-1
I 've used Zoo Med bulbs before but sometimes they burn out so quickly I have to wonder why the inconsistency . I use one at a time and both bulbs that I got on about March 13th are burnt out as of yesterday ( April 19th ) . I 'm disgusted by this extremely short lifespan and will probably try something else now.Other than the short life span , the bulbs seem to give my turtle the light and heat she needs and enjoys so I had no complaints about that .	-1
I put one of these lights in the lamp above my reptile tank on 2/15/2013 ; with 12 hours a day of use it burned out on 3/04/2013 . It gave out very good illumination and heat for basking , so my lizards enjoyed it . However , unless the second one in this package convinces me the first one was just a fluke , I 'm going to avoid this brand of pet products . I do n't want to rely on something that will fail in such a short amount of time .	-1
I ordered these for my water dragon habitat . The package arrived and when I picked it up , it made a rattling sound . They had placed the bulb box in a slightly bigger box with absolutely no cushioning at all and no warning on the outside box of fragile contents . One bulb was completely shattered . The other worked . I put it in the fixture while I processed a replacement order because I needed a basking bulb right away . The second box came and nothing was shattered , but one of the lights was a total dud and did n't even light up once.The other in that box worked fine . So I put the dud in the box with the shattered one and sent it back for the return and kept the 2 working bulbs . Next time I 'll go to a local pet store so that I can return a dud right away if it happens and so I do n't risk them shattering in transit .	-1
I 've had these bulbs installed above my tortoise enclosures for about two weeks now . They are much brighter than the Exo Terra lights I had previously . This is my first attempt at using Zoo Med lights and I like them so far . My tortoises seem to enjoy basking under them as well . Right now I have them in a normal inustrial clamp style lamp from a big box store . However , I will be buying theZoo Med Combo Deep Dome Dual Lamp Fixturefor theZoo Med ReptiCare Ceramic Infrared Heat Emitter 150 WattsI have.Update 10/29/12 : After less than 4 months of having these lights on a 12-hour daily timer they have both burnt out . I 've never had a reptile light last so short of time . I would not recommend this light . I will be order two of these : Exo Terra Repti-Glo 10.0 Compact Fluorescent Desert Terrarium Lamp , 26-Watt . It only merrits 1 star and that would be soley based on it 's price point .	-1
I bought these bulbs not even a month ago ! ! ! : ( And they both have blown out ! What a waste of money ! ! ! SMH I will continue to be on the hunt for the best bulb , when I find it.. I 'll post an update review ! ! But this sure is n't a lasting bulb at all . 2 shot in less then a month . I bought this product on July 3rd . Terrible . No stars for me ! ! ! Still a great price for two .	-1
These liners are flimsy , and you would n't believe that the manufacturer actually made these for their own product ! I have had the Booda Clean Step litter box for 5 years , and think it is the best litter box around ! However these liners do n't even seem to be tailored to this box . I have been using I use the JONNY CAT Jumbo Litter Box Drawstring Liners ( you can find them at pet and grocery stores ) and they work like a charm !	-1
Do not be fooled reading these reviews ! ! This is a different formula then before and this is pure trash ! ! I used this yrs ago on my cat who was spraying everywhere before he was fixed , loved it , now we got a puppy and again i ordered this unknowing that the company sold the name off and got the bottles , yes more then 1 ! ! Right away noticed the awful smell and tried it , now the house smells rather then the area where she went and it smells nasty ! ! It did ok on the stain , nothing to shout about , but the smell is worse and more prominent now ! ! Thanks to another poster who posted the old brands product i ordered that and within hours knew it was the real stuff to take away stains and odors ! ! Petastic is the only product you should buy that will work for sure ! ! this is what i found online if you doubt me ... '' I sent an email directly to Venus Laboratories with the following question : Are Petastic ( tm ) and Nature 's Miracle the same formula ? I 'd like a definitive answer , please.Not more than an hour later , I received this response : The people that make Petastic ( tm ) made the original Nature 's Miracle formula , which they own . The current Nature 's Miracle formula is not the original formula . Petastic ( tm ) stain & odor remover is the original formula . So the short answer is no ''	-1
I purchased a gallon of this stuff upon a recommendation from a pet store employee . Sure enough when my puppy had his first accident I ran for the Nature 's Miracle.It helped but it did n't solve the problem . In fact , it made the stain yellow and it smelled like a bottle of rubbing alcohol . This happened time and again with future stains.Out of frustration I went back to the pet store and purchaed their second best seller , Simple Solution . That actually worked and it even removed the yellowing that Nature 's Miracle caused.The Simple Solution was less expensive , smelled better and most importantly it worked ! Nature 's Miracle does n't live up to its name .	-1
I 'm currently fostering a pit bull who marks his territory in my house when left alone for even a few minutes . Frequently I do n't discover the urine until it 's already dried into the carpet and I 'm left with both the scent and the stain . This product works well for removing the scent/odor of urine , but it definitely does n't remove the stain . Thankfully a friend of mine who owns a consignment store another product , Kleen Warrior ( sold door to door ) that lifts the urine stain overnight.Bottom line : Have urine odors ? This will work for you ! Have stains ? Find a different product .	-1
I thought I followed the directions correctly . However , I did not have a good result using it . It is not a simple apply and wipe . There are a few steps you must take to ensure proper results.I used it correctly once and thought it was a lot of work . In all fairness getting the stain and smell out should probably take a lot of effort . I , however , was not as happy with the outcome to want to try it again.If you are more disciplined and patient than I am , then maybe this is the product for you . I did better with theBISSELL Little Green Multi-Purpose Compact Deep Cleaner and the pet cleaner product you can buy for it .	-1
Dog continues to do his business in places I have spent hours saturating with NM.I 've worked hours on spots , dog still goes .	-1
I purchased this as a way to combat the smell from urine accidents resulting from a UTI in one of my cats . I treated the spots as recommended but the smell did not go away , and was only diminished for a short time . I treated the areas multiple times.I ended up buying a special pet detergent for my steam vac and the problem was gone after one use , so I really wish I would not have purchased this product , as I used the entire bottle with no results .	-1
It took me several cleanings with this product to get the smell out . Thats okay , but I think I may have been sent a defective product or the top was n't screwed on tight enough because when it got here the box was soaked with it . It had leaked out of the plastic bag it was sealed in , and in the bag was 2 inches lf the product . I sent them an email and a picture of it , but I did't get a refund or anything .	-1
I followed the directions on the back of the bottle and used the product several times . Unfortunately , it did n't take the urine smell out of our carpets . Thinking I did n't use enough , I used more the next times , but it still did n't help . Moreover , it does n't make sense to have to use so much of the bottle for one stain even if I did n't use enough . Wanted to love it , though .	-1
It arrived almost empty , the bottle was not sealed properly and leaked during shipment . This is the second time in a row this has happened with a Nature 's Miracle product , I am obviously not meant to have it : (	-1
Cleaned up after my pup with this ... he returned to the exact same area again ... so does not work as it is supposed to ... made my floors sticky with residue as well -- had to mop 3 times to remove all residue .	-1
but I do n't like saying I hate it . This product does not work . In fact I think it left a stain rather than took it away . Not worth the purchase .	-1
Got rid of stain & I could n't smell anything . But after using it the only spot on the carpet my chihuahua would use to wet on was the spot I 'd cleaned w/Nature 's mis . Stain & Odor Remover . I used as directed then reapplied . It became her calling card & # 34 ; here 's the ladies room & # 34 ; , My friend had similar results w/ a min pin . DO NOT RECOMMEND	-1
This product just did n't work at all , in fact I 'm almost convinced the poodle boy was actually attracted to it . : /	-1
I bought the toothpaste and there were some weird green fibers in there . My dog sniffed at it and turned his head away . So I called the manufacturer , ( 800 ) 338-3659 , to ask them what the green fibers were . They did send a pick-up for lab test but later never returned my phone call when I asked for the result ( I called many times . When I called this company no one ever answers the phone . I do n't know if it 's going out of business or what . But I would n't dare to purchase any more product from this company	-1
I bought this thinking it would benefit my bettas but I think it had very little affect on them . You are better off buying indian almond leaves .	-1
This food is like the junk food of the fish food aisle . This food made my fish VERY constipated . Their poop was so bright pink/red I thought their internal organs were coming out . Fake colored food does n't make your fish vibrantly colored.I instead recommend something from the New Life Spectrum which gives better quality food . Within 24 hours of switching over to New Life Spectrum my fish were much more lively .	-1
This product did not seem to help my plants at all . It also discolored and clouded up my aquarium water , which was very disappointing .	-1
I have two cardinalfish , two clownfish , and five damsels , one of them 6 '' long , who is a ravenous eater . Most have been in my tank for more than 4 years ; the tank has been healthy for more than a decade . I feed them a varied diet , including dried crustaceans . Each one seems to have preferred foods , but they all eat whatever I put in , except the small cardinalfish who is newest . I have used Tetra ( not this product ) in the past with good results . My fish will not touch the Tetra Jumbo Krill whether I put it in whole or broken up . If anybody could explain to me how to make it interesting to them ( assuming it 's wholesome ) , I 'd be interested .	-1
My fish does n't eat this . I was trying to give my betta some variety but this does n't appeal to him at all . But I am giving it more than star because it is a little less messy than the clumpy brine shrimp by Hikari . This food is at least in small flakes . Too bad my fish does n't like it !	-1
Got this in the mail and the seal was broken . Either previously used or just busted but it does n't seem to stop the bleeding . Thinking its gone bad .	-1
I will buy the powder next time because it just seems to get hard and fall off and the quick will start to bleed again .	-1
None of the fish in my two large tanks will go near this product . They love blood worms , but ignore this stuff .	-1
I was a bit disappointed with the product as tthere was a lot of shrimp dust and only a little of the lumps of shrimps in the container i received . Good amount for the price and i used the dusty shrimp in the nursery.Maybe it was just a bad container that i got ?	-1
I could n't get my beta fish to eat this stuff . He tasted it once and never touched it again . I was so surprised . I read that betta fish like brine shrimp ! Also , this fish food is messy compared to the betta pellets . It comes in large clumps that I have to break up and then it spreads all over the water like dirt . My fish just looks at it as swims away . Apparently this is money down the drain !	-1
my fuzzy fish simply did not like it .	-1
The & # 34 ; Shrimp & # 34 ; are basically powder.Most of it ends up in the bottom of the tank which is not a good thing.I would not buy this product again .	-1
I ordered the one in the red box but they sent me this instead . Just added it to tank , hopefully it does what I need .	-1
Do n't work - simple as that . I called the manufacturer and the rep was extremely helpful . She comped ( free sample ) of their phosphate/nitrate resin . However , Chemiclean did not perform as advertised . For you folks who are asking `` what is a medicine show ? '' 100 years or so a go , a guy would sell a bottle of stuff that would cure every ailment from A - Z . He usually put on a small show in front of his truck or horse drawn wagon .	-1
I 'm not sure what I was expecting when I bought a bag of clay dirt - but I could n't believe how messy this stuff was ! ! ! You could rinse this forever and it would never get clean . I tried rinsing it which did n't work so I hoped it would just settle out nicely . I put a layer of this stuff under my normal gravel and very gently added water . It still sent a red cloud of dust out and when it settled , everything was covered in a brown dusty film . I went through three filter cartridges in a week after adding this . In the future I would MAYBE use this if I had plants in pods but never just in the bottom of the tank . Not worth it .	-1
Much better alternatives out there and if you watch the Eco-Carib stuff you can get it for the same price for a bigger bag . This stuff is nothing but iron powder . I bought 2 bags to give it a test ... After receiving it , i threw it in my garden . No way i am dumping this in a fish tank .	-1
Came broken i had a working one that needed a new axle so this donated that and i tossed this motor in the closet .	-1
*****Update - since writing my review I have changed my mind about this product . The first small package was great but I 'm finding that with my second purchase , a 150-count box , about half the pads do not absorb well at all . ***** When my usual Iris brand puppy pads were dropped from the Prime free shipping program I decided to try these in the smallest quantity just in case they were n't up to snuff . I have a cat who will poop in her litter boxes but wo n't wee in them . I have to keep her highness supplied with several `` urination stations '' ( small low-sided litter pans with folded baby blanket and wee-wee pad on top ) lest she opt for the carpet . I was afraid these pads would be so different she would not use them but she does use them and they are actually better than the Iris in a couple of ways . They are larger than the regular size Iris and the plastic backing is a blue that even with my low functioning eyeballs I can tell without feeling which side is which . And I think these pads are more absorbent too . I 'll be buying the 150 pack next . The 150 pack is a rigid cardboard box . It is much easier to remove the pads from than the plastic bag-like packaging of the Iris brand .	-1
I do n't know where these came from if there to old or something is wrong with them , but our 3 month old Yorkies wo n't use them they want to tear them up every time we put a new one in the tray .	-1
These pads , do absorb quickly , but runs off the edges as well as through the plastic . I definitely DO NOT recommend them	-1
I have been buying this brand the last few times I purchased puppy pads for my two dogs and was greatly pleased with how they worked , but this time they definitely were not the same as before . They looked the same but the urine seeped through the pads and onto the floor and made a big mess . At first I thought my dogs had peed on the floor but after picking up the pad found there was no way they could have with as much urine as there was underneath the pad . Evidently there was not enough padding to soak up the urine . I also found that the pads did not retain any of the odor as stated they would , as they absolutely smelled horrible after the dogs used them . I am definitely displeased . I did n't know whether to place another order or not since it was time but saw where someone else complained about the same thing after going back to the site and also found that the price had increased about $ 10 , so I definitely know I will search for another brand this time and try something different .	-1
I do n't know how many different versions of this pad is available under this name but depending on the quantity of the pads , the quality varies . The best one 's are in the 100 or 150 pack , as they are really absorbent and do the job . Our older dog is having issues controlling his bladder and the little one , this one especially does not do the work of absorbing . Looks like they always want you to purchase the one 's that have more in the bag .	-1
These did n't work for my 2 yr. old Italian Greyhound . She would n't go near them . You win some , you lose some . This one I lost .	-1
I brought this product to help housetrain my dachshund/maltese puppy . Since we adopted her a month ago , she has continued to mess in the house , despite our best efforts to teach her to use the doggy door . Realizing that she was at least toileting only in certain parts of the house , I felt that training pads would help to prevent the floor from becoming stained and smelly . Eventually , I hope to slowly move the pads outside and get her fully house-trained.I brought a pack of 50 pads , hoping to give them a try and then buy a greater number if the brand worked as desired . Unfortunately , after trying the product for the last three days , I must say that I will be trying alternative brands when these have all gone.Simply put , these pads are not very absorbent at all . After my dog has urinated on the pads , the liquid quickly seeps through and dampens the floor beneath . This leaves me having to mop , disinfect and deodorize the area every time my dog uses the pads . This is not what I intended ! On the tiled flooring , this is n't so bad , but I wanted something that would stop the bedroom carpet being ruined . And this product just is not going to do it.Not only does the urine soak right through to the floor , but it also remains wetter on the top than I would have expected . If my dog walks on the pads after she 's relieved herself , her paws are damp with urine.On a positive note , I 'm not sure whether it is because of simple luck ( I have been placing the pads exactly where my dog continues to mess ) or the scent of the pads themselves ( meant to encourage dogs to use the pads ) , but so far , my dog has had about an 80 % success rate using these pads . They are fairly large , so when she does use them , they easily contain her mess.Another positive thing I can say about these pads is that my dog , ( thankfully ) has not attempted to use them as a toy . She would typically try to play or destroy anything that she can , yet she simply uses these pads for the purpose they are intended and leaves them alone at all other times . I was rather impressed ( do n't know if that 's just my dog that does n't want to play with them , or whether the product has some scent that discourages her from using them as a play thing . )	-1
It is dead . Was difficult to open and close , I was constantly cussing at this thing during filter changes . This is not the filter I remember using 8 years ago . Also , after the first month it because incredibly loud , the livingroom filled with a humming that was maddening .	-1
I have this filter along with a Fluval 205 on a 55 gallon goldfish tank . The little Fluval is doing all the work . This canister filter is only equiped for mechanical and chemical filtration when , as we all know biological is by far the most important . There is no room for bio filter media . There is a seperate bio-wheel attatchment for bio filtration . I do not use carbon and so filled the carbon chamber with ceramic rings for bio media . There is VERY little room to add the media of your choice . This filter does a good job at mechanical filtration and my water is generally clear . For only a bit more money you can get an AquaTop or Fluval- both much better in my opinion with a lot of room for media . On the upside the customer service is great- I 've called multiple times because of problems and they always help . The filter is simple to assemble and maintain .	-1
Will this filter do everything is says ? YES ! It 'll keep your tank clean and it 'll last for years but ... and this is a HUGE BUT ... This filter was made in the late 80s , the design was nice for its time but compared to what we have now its pretty terrible . Initial set up must be done with extreme care or you 'll get leaks everywhere ( Prepare to spend 2-3 hours for initial set up ) . Maintenance takes about 1 hour ( with the quick disconnect valve ) expect longer if you do n't have it . VERY noisy until fully primed , which takes 2-3 days ( You need to wait 2-3 days for the noise to die down after each maintenance ) Theres absolutely no reason why this filter should still be on the market , I 'm a huge fan of Marineland , have ton of their products but this filter design is almost 30 years old ... Its time to retire this and come up with a new design.This cost almost as much as most modern day canister filters ... Do yourself a favor save an extra 20 dollars and get a Fluval 405 . ( Maintance on my 405 takes 15 minute max and virtually no mess ) There is pro to this filter ... The biowheel addon is awesome ! Been keeping aquarium for almost 15 years , and I have to say BioWheel is probably one of the best biological filtration you can get .	-1
A long time fan of Marineland products - the Magnum 350 caught my interest because it can double as a water polishing unit that uses cartridges.I placed a call to Marinland and found out the polishing cartridge will remove particles as small as 10-15 microns . For true water polishing the only filter in the world that can remove particles as small as one micron in size is the Diatom by Vortex - renowned for it 's ability to filter out pathogens and parasites like ich.As a primary filter for your aquarium I ca n't recommend the Magnum.It 's limited to mechanical filtration only , the chamber you use for activated charcoal is far to small to hold enough biological filter media to colonize enough nitrifying bacteria.The filter has poor build quality all the way around.It ca n't hold a candle to the solid craftsmanship you would find with say , eheim . It 's also sub par to anything put out by Fluval.Problems happened fast after the first use . The impeller is quirky it starts and stops and is a constant battle . You 're forever having to adjust it and the entire assembly . It can leak as well - Especially if you have n't applied enough silicone to the head gasket . It 's also loud - and it 's a noise like a coffee grinder.Quick Specs* Certified Flow Rate of 350 GPH* No water bypass* Good for tanks up to 100 gallons* Can convert easily from continuous filtration to water polishing* 2 year manufacturer 's warranty* Polishing cartridges can be cleaned and re-charged with bleach solutionAt the list price around $ 329.99 I would n't give it a first glance not to mention a second one . But to find it here on Amazon for a mere $ 94 - it 's a decent deal.The polishing cartridges sell for $ 19.99 just about everyplace I looked.However you can find them here on Amazon for $ 9.00This is n't a filter for everyone . It should only be the choice of the hobbyist who wants water polishing from time to time.And who understands the issues and headaches that come with owning and maintaining one .	-1
After several treatments , following the instructions on the bottle , there is still exactly the same amount of algae as there was before the first treatment . It did n't harm my fish , but it also did n't affect the algae at all .	-1
Bought this product since I have some algea building up in my 30 gallon aquarium . I scraped the algae off but figured I would throw in a small amount of this too . I ended up throwing in a small amount of Algaefix and did a water change so I threw in a little more Algaefix . The next morning I noticed my Danios were sitting on the bottom of the tank . My Rainbow Shark went into hiding as well.Immediately changed 50 % of the water and it got my Danios to swim around again , but within a few days , my Rainbow Shark died . I 've had that shark for about 5 months . Never had problems with him . He lived when other fish died . This time the only thing that changed when I cleaned my tank is adding Algaefix ... and it killed my shark . Nothing else changed about my water . Not using this anymore .	-1
Did not get this product from Amazon but still felt compelled to review it . BAD PRODUCT ! This stuff kills fish ! Period ! Live with the manual algae cleanings unless you want to buy new fish . This killed 3 out of 12 goldfish ( so far , not sure if the others will survive at this point ) and has the remaining 9 goldfish acting berserk . Hoping 2 back to back 75 % water changes was enough to get this crap out of the tank . I agree with some of the other reviews , this product should be taken off the market . VERY BAD PRODUCT !	-1
I 'll keep this short and sweet - I followed the directions and used this 3 times -- no luck ... . the water in my waterfall with constant aeration is still green . I think there are better products on the market . I hope this helps .	-1
I never use chemicals in my tanks but this time I decided to try because I developed an algae problem in one of my tanks that I could not get under control after adding t5ho lighting ( Even after reducing light duration ) . Since I am averse to unnecessary chemicals entering my tanks I only gave a half dose after a water change yesterday . When I awoke this morning I had a lovely tank of dead fish . There is nothing else that would have contributed to the entire tank being wiped out but this hideous product ( My ammonia , nitrate and nitrite levels are fine ) . I wrote API about it and am awaiting a response . STAY AWAY from this and use any other method of destroying algae that does not consist of using this product ( Or any other chemical product for that matter ) . API/MARS should be ashamed to have this on the market .	-1
I get a lot of algae in my 44 gallon tank . I have some algae eater fish and snail , and I do regular weekly maintenance but the algae always seems to get ahead of me . I tried this product but it did n't seem to do all that much so I stopped using it . The best approach is to try not to have an algae problem to begin with : get livestock that eats algae and watch how much you feed them .	-1
well , it was an add-on , but the plastic circles on milk-bottles do the same . My cats paid no attention , and for a few pieces of small plastic coils even a low price is overpriced . Was disappointed .	-1
... my cats just dont like them . i thought they'ld love em since they the love the Ethical Pet Wide Durable Heavy Gauge Plastic Colorful Springs . Go figure . You get 3 lousy Looney Loops for $ 5 + they barely gave em the time of day . But the pack of 10 Ethical springs for less than $ 2 a pack they cant get enough of . Theres nothing wrong with the looney Loops , you just cant predict whats going to tickle a cats fancy .	-1
items are very cheap..and my cat was n't at all interested in them..overpriced and overrated in other reviews..disapointing and too cheap to return for refund .	-1
I think when it comes to cats its hard to tell what they like or do not like.They absolutely love the plastic spring toys so I thought these would be almost the same , just a bit more durable than the thinner spring ones ... which have somewhat short life span due to those sharp cat teeth ! no luck for my Bengals.so this is not a negative review of the product as much as a heads up ; - )	-1
My two cats were not impressed with these . Granted , they are older cats and do n't play with much in general , but they are still cats that like to bat things around here n there . Just had no interest in these . Stick with milk jug cap rings . They love those .	-1
The reason I am only giving a one star to my review is that the picture was deceptive . The basking lamp shown was a 100 watt and when I received my order , I was shipped 75 watt lamps . I could have probably bought the 75 watt lamps locally at a price that would have been just as good as what I paid . I think this is deceptive advertising . The lamps themselves are fine , although not what I thought I was ordering .	-1
The first bulb lasted about two days . We 'll see how long the second one lasts . Not worth paying for return shipping . I 'll stick to Petsmart so that returns are easier .	-1
While these are quality spot bulbs , you can purchase standard household use bulbs from any hardware store for far less than what these cost . If you use Halogen Floods ( GE , Philips , etc . ) you will get more heat per watt and the bulbs will last longer . One advantage of these is that as energy efficiency laws limit the production of high wattage household bulbs , these will still be available because they are considered a & # 34 ; specialty bulb & # 34 ; despite being essentially the same as a come tigh beam spot bulb .	-1
I have been buying these lamps for 7 or 8 years . I had an adult male iguana ( has sadly since passed away of old age ) and I have a Russian tortoise , and I was using these lamps for both . I would even sometimes use these bulbs when I had a sick bird that needed a bit of extra warmth . ( I had an additional UV source for the iguana ; was using this one primarily for the heat . ) For years , these were great . They would last me a long enough time that I would forget how old they were . I would hardly ever have to buy replacements , and they provided an appropriate amount of heat for the locations in which I placed them.And then , about a year ago , something happened . They started burning out in less than a month . Several of them only lasted 2 weeks . I even tried replacing the fixtures they were in . I used both the metal reflective types and the fixtures that are white on the inside and black on the outside . Brand new or old , it was n't the fixtures -- the bulbs just kept going out.I was buying them at a physical store and inspecting them before use and nothing LOOKED out of the ordinary . The boxes they came in were in good shape . So it was n't a problem with shipping , but instead with materials and/or manufacturing.Anyway , 2 stars because they were good at one time . Perhaps they 'll fix whatever is wrong in their manufacturing process and become good again . In the meantime , if you are looking for a replacement item , the PetSmart store brand ones have lasted me for at least 4-5 months so far and are still working as I type this .	-1
Purchased a total of 2 of these bulbs . The first did not work at all ( was returned and replaced ) , the second lasted less than 1 month on an 8 hour a day timer , and the replacement only lasted slightly over a month . Very disappointing product , and not worth the cost .	-1
I finally stopped using the Petmate Fresh Flow water fountains . My experience with them was n't satisfactory and I resented having to buy filters for them .	-1
These are junk ! I used this type of water fountain 6 years ago . I have recently come back to it , and am disappointed at how flimsy the filters now are . They used to have a hard plastic frame inside the filter , and you could actually hear the charcoal when it was activated in water . Now , I 'm hard pressed to believe that there is any charcoal in there at all ! I do n't really need to filter water , as I have a well , but cats being what they are , love to play and `` rinse '' their feet in the water . Lots of big chunks get into the water , as well as fur . This filter will control the debris , but for someone who is filtering less desirable water , these filters may not stand up to the test . Too bad the price is n't lower for these cheap things .	-1
This is the second type of fish food from this manufacturer that I have tried for my Oscar . This is also the second fail . My Oscar refuses to eat this food also . He 'll suck it up because he is obviously hungry , but no matter how hungry he is , he spits it right back out . I offered him this food and only this food for 4 days straight . He went hungry for 4 days , simply refusing to eat this stuff . Oh well , a friend of mine can use it to feed her pond goldfish .	-1
Neither my pleco nor my loaches are a fan of these . When I put one in , the pleco will come over , take an exploratory nibble , and move on to other things . And he 's a total glutton . Within just a couple of minutes , the wafers dissolve into a green icky mess on the bottom of the tank.On the plus side , my cats love it . It 's become an effective decoy when I feed the fish . Now I can give one of these to each cat while I feed the stuff that the fish actually like without having the cats trying to knock over the fish food containers .	-1
I got this for my cory catfish ... but they seemed do n't care for it at all ... ... i guess it 's probably more for plecos	-1
My betta is n't a fan . She 'll eventually eat them , but only after spitting them back a couple of times . Although Zoe also does n't like bloodworms so maybe she 's just picky . I 'm going to go with a different brand next time . I 'm sure the nutrition is fine , but I want her to like her food more !	-1
These pellets are economical and fish do like them , but they have one HUGE drawback : they 're filthy . In a matter of seconds in the tank they will begin to `` puff up '' and get soft , and start making a mess of your substrate . Even with the fish eating them , they ca n't keep it under control and just tend to create even more of a mess . These things will surely make a mess of your tank in no time if you do n't clean up after your fish or if you do n't under feed . If you are having any sort of health-oriented problem in your tank , from ammonia in the water to algae , one of the first things I 'd do is stop feeding this stuff and start feeding a quality , clean food like any number of other pellets available by other companies.These are best avoided , only use them if you are in a pinch or to offer something different on a rare occasion for your fish . I 'll never buy them again .	-1
These are fine , though they are much cheaper if you went to buy them from a WalMart . I bought it for a little over three dollars ( sort of my reason to give it a try ) . However , these are very cheap and will fall apart once in the water . They also appear to lack taste to my fish , as I have used shrimp pellets by Omega One ( that I love ) and my fish prefer it . I have tested it by switching foods on them . For whatever reason , they do not care for the Wardley shrimp pellets and will only eat it if they are famished ( plus , it falls apart into uneatable crumbles ) . Whenever I drop in the Omega One pellet , they go nuts and will go for them immediately . Depends on your fish I suppose , but I do have a few tanks and all of them prefer the Omega One shrimp pellets . If you need a less expensive alternative , stop by a WalMart and get it for under four dollars . Or try the Advanced Nutrition shrimp pellets by Wardley and see if they are better ( they are about the same price on here and I have not seen them in stores yet ) .Walmart 's price for the Wardley pellets is currently $ 3.67 . ( Feb 3 , 2013 )	-1
I got these for guppies , but the guppies could n't eat them . I tried to then use them for parrot cichlids and they would n't eat them since it was small enough it did n't really catch their attention . I ended up using SOME of this for a beta ( crumbling the granules ) before he died ( from being a losing bully ) Now I have 3/4 of a container , and it 's almost a year later . It 's food I ca n't feed anyone ! Maybe will try with the coi !	-1
These are advertised as slow sinking but 95 % of the granules drop straight to the bottom as soon as they hit the water . My fish tend to spit the granules out because they 're too hard even after they 've been in the water for a while . My fish like the Tetra Color flakes but these granules were a waste of money .	-1
I 've been keeping Fancy Goldfish for close to 40 years and if I 've learned anything about these marvelous creatures it 's that they need all the room you can provide , massive water changes and wide variety of sinking foods.Here are the ingrediants for TetraFin : Fish meal - You want to see a specific fish named such as salmon meal or white fish meal ( as with all pet foods ) `` Fish meal '' means the MFG is using whatever is cheapest at market including rancid diseased fish and fish by products.Ground brown rice - The first three ingrediants of ANY pet or fish food should be a specific animal protien - period . Rice is a filler used for weight and volume to the packaging.Torula dried yeast - cheap protien enhancerOat meal - binding agent and fillerShrimp meal - Excellent but is only found in trace amounts in this foodWheat gluten - The number one source for pet food related deaths and recalls in the past 20 years . Works as a binding agent and artifically pumps up crude protien percentageSoybean oil - Few Omega fatty acidsFish oil - Again you want to see a specific fish named like salmon . When a specific animal is n't mentioned it means the manufacturer is buying whatever is cheapest at the time . What is more , this leaves them free to use rancid and diseased fish.Algae meal - Excellent but in very low arounts here.Sorbitol- Artifical sweetner makes food more palatable to fish , can be potentially toxic.Artifical colors including yellow 5 , red 3 , and blue 2 , - Zero nutrional valueethoxyquin . - Ethoxyquin is usually listed as a `` preservtive - however it 's a lethal pesticide . The FDA has banned from dog and cat foods . Studies show ethoxyquin is especially lethal to fish . research Google or simply look it up on Wiki-Pedia and follow the links to the research findings.What is more , flake foods should be avoided at all costs . Most Fancy Goldfish especially deep chested fish like Oranda , Ranch and butterflys are all extremly susceptable to bouyancy issues and swim bladder disease . One of the significant causes of this , is the taking in of air . That said your fish are infinatley better off with sinking foods.Much better commercial foods include those by ZooMed , Aqueon , Omega One , New Spectrum and Hikari .	-1
I was so excited to learn about Hikari Betta Bio-Gold Food . After all , it was quoted to me repeatedly as being the *best* for Betta fish . And what pet owner does not want to give the very best to their little friend ? I was so excited to change our little betta 's food until I read the ingredients on the package . MONOSODIUM GLUTAMATE ? ? ? ? ? You have GOT to be kidding ! The package was returned . After seeing the awful effects MSG has on people , there is no way in the world I am giving it to a tiny fish.I can not believe that no one has pointed this out before this- at least I have not seen anyone do it.I even checked the manufacturer of Betta Bio-Gold to be sure that this was true and it is . They do put it in the food as of the date of this review.FORGET THIS STUFF !	-1
Tried these for my 125 gallon Gold Fish tank . They ended up causing cloudiness in my tank . I was not overfeeding either , before somebody chimes in . I never had this problem before using them , and have never had it since I stopped .	-1
The sponge material used on these is extremely inferior . It loses its shape and tight fit around the lift tube fairly rapidly from cleanings . The pore size is n't really ideal for most common applications , it should be larger for better flow and less clogging . Most do n't need a fry safe size , if you do it 's something you use only as long as needed since a larger pore is more effective . The pedestal base is also a poor design- sponge filters are generally better set directly on the bottom , or even partly buried into the substrate . For the size , there really is n't that much sponge for bio-filtration , an awful lot of it is the unnecessarily bulky plastic pedestal . The extra wide lift tube really is n't an asset , sponge filters are much more effective with only a low to moderate flow rate- a faster rate is counterproductive.EDIT : I do see from the description the `` pro '' line now claims to use a reticulated sponge- whether or not this is actually different or better than the ones I have owned I 'm not certain , but it may address some of the earlier problems . I still feel it is a 1 star product due to the other issues , as well as the exorbitant price- much better filters can be purchased at half or less .	-1
These might be OK if higher humidity levels did n't knock them down . I was using this to monitor my dubia roach colony , but that was too humid for the adhesive back that these come with .	-1
I would not recommend . I 've had two and they never calibrated to the one brand I have that I know is right . If they could be calibrated or consistent in their inaccuracy it would be ok .	-1
I have 4 different hygrometers to compare . The other three showed 34-35 % humidity this one showed 68 % If you ask me this is a piece of junk . I sent it back .	-1
This item is non-returnable , something Amazon fails to inform us anywhere in the description.When I received this I saw that it was cheaply made and the bottle was too small and then found out that it was non-returnable.So I tried using it anyway , in a smaller 10 gallon tank . It ran for 48 hours before it killed my prize show quality betta that cost me more than 3x the cost of this contraption . In that time the CO2 created was undetectable using a drop checker . The amount of CO2 produced is proportional to the bottle size . The typical DIY CO2 system uses a 2 liter bottle , this bottle is less than half that size . The ladder functions , but it looks and feels cheap.This system is a very nice small bottle , $ 1 worth of airline tubing , and a plastic ladder that looks and feels like something you would expect to pay $ 3 for . So you are basically paying $ 20 for a nice bottle , and $ 5 for the rest of the junk . Oh do n't forget the packets of yeast and baking soda , that is what makes this work no matter what fancy names they want to call those packets . Last time I checked yeast and baking soda , cost almost nothing in small quantities.You can build a better system with a two litter bottle , a diffuser , and some airline tubing . The only trick connecting the airline tubing to the bottle cap with an airtight seal , you can buy such a bottlecap on ebay if you do n't want to go through the trouble . The whole thing will cost about $ 10-15 . Oh and this sort of system should have a check valve so stuff does n't run the wrong way , through the tubing , a safety feature not included with the Nutrafin system.I saved the worst part for last . The ladder connects to the glass with suction cups creating a gap just the right size for a betta , or a similar sized fish , to swim into and get stuck . My betta , his name was Poseidon , died horribly this way , stuck there between the glass and the ladder , certainly struggling desperately to escape until it killed him . If you love your fish , then I implore you not to put this thing into your tank . Or if you must , modify the ladder so there is no space between the glass and the back of the ladder .	-1
without any obstructions , the top cracked on one , and if it was n't for some strange thing that woke me up at1 am and sent me down to the fish room , my 72 would have been drained on my landlord 's carpet by about 3 am.I 'll never take that chance again , and it 's unfortunate , because they 've done very well for me in the past.Hagen is a great name , and maybe I got a lemon , but I 've had at least two of these on every planted tank I 've everhad without any problems . But I ca n't recommend something that can do this . NO , it was n't too tight , I 've been dealing withthem for years .	-1
And now the magnet is in 2 pieces instead of one . After a very short time the magnet separates and causes the impeller to stop turning . I have called the company several times about this and they send me new impeller assemblies that has the same failure.I have 6 of these units and the newer ones I have purchased all fail . This is a problem on newer models . The older models have a 1 piece magnet and are no trouble . Everyone that is having a problem check the magnet and see if it is starting to split in half	-1
I really wanted to like this filter . Unfortunately , two bad units ( water leak and then air leak ) and the not-so-quiet nature of the filter prevented me from doing so.I have a small tank , and so the idea of an external hang-on was great for saving space . This filter also had solid reviews . Unfortunately , the first unit I received leaked from its base whenever it was not turned on . It was not a huge leak , but it was not small either and would soak through cardboard in a few hours . So I returned it . The second canister has an air intake leak somewhere that prevents it from working -- it just sucks up air and fails within ten seconds or so . I called customer service , double-checked all instructions , tried sealing the D-ring with the included silicone and checking all connections , and the silicone helped but did not solve the problem . It still sucks in air , at a slower rate , and fails . I can not find another source of the air leak , so I can not use the filter.Even if these brand new canisters did n't have two defects in a row , they were also too loud for my use and the output valve was too high . I 'm not in a loud place , and these are not anywhere near `` whisper '' quiet . They have an audible drone -- louder than my soft music when I 'm sitting ten feet or so from the tank . They also make a constant water whooshing sound ( not so shocking , of course , since it 's a filter that whooshes water around ) . Finally , the output valve , which the instructions say to `` always keep under water level '' is very short for a hang-on . You can buy an optional extension , but a longer connector should have been standard.Again , I am surprised at my experience and disappointed . I normally like Marineland , but I am switching to another filter .	-1
I bought this filter to replace my Penguin 150 , which is a 30g filter . My little Penguin worked side by side with my Emperor 280 for 3 years and he worked like a champ ! When it broke I considered just leaving the Emperor 280 to work by himself , but in the end I ended up looking for another filter . I had always been interested in this particular model . I have never been disappointed by Marineland products , and from what I can tell the more expensive their product the better performance I get . At least that 's what I used to think until now.One of the reasons I decided on the HOT Magnum was because of its large container for chemical filtration . My Emperor 280 has a small container and I get wonders from it . I figured that with a larger container i 'd get a lot more performance . Also , the size of the filter impressed me . It took about the same width that my Penguin 150 used up , and since I could n't fit anything larger in its hood panel I opted for this one.After having this filter for about half a year now all I can say is that I 'm disappointed . Honestly , I think there 's something wrong with this design . Your typical hang on top filter is based on a pretty simple concept . The water is sucked up , it falls into the reservoir , and as it falls back into the filter it has to go through a wall of filtration . This , in my opinion , provides for maximum contact between the cascading water and the filters . With this filter , however , it 's different . In fact , I do n't even know how it works . All I can tell is that the filter sits in the middle , the motor is at the bottom so its shooting water up , and i guess it fills the canister with water ? Seriously , how does it work ? I mean , there 's this big black tube that goes in the middle and the water runs through it , but it has no pores or openings , so i do n't even know how the `` filtered '' water gets through this tube and out of the filter . Even when I open this filter to clean it I can tell that it has very poor performance . Compared to my Emperor 280 , the filter on this thing after a month is practically clean . There 's a few bits of gunk trapped here and there , but nothing impressive . My Emperor 280s filter pad looks disgusting after a month . Seriously , it 's like there 's another 2 extra layers of thickness made up of fish gunk . Overall i 'm not impressed at all with this filter . If you 're looking for a HOT filter look no further than the Emperor 280 . It provides both chemical , mechanical , and an automatic biowheel for biological filtration . For now , i 'm going to keep this thing until dies . Thankfully I have my faithful Emperor 280 working for me.Fish stats:30g2 yoyo loaches1 bamboo shrimseveral tropicals .	-1
Ok . This was IMPOSSIBLE to get to work . It sucked . I bought an extra seal and am hoping by double sealing it I can get it to work . I was hoping to use it to clean gunk after I do a cleaning of the tank . I 'll post if the double seal worked . As is , pain in the butt and I would NOT buy this product again . I bought it to try and use it like a Vortex diatom but not fun at all and just got myself super wet trying to get it to pump .	-1
This is not my first Filstar filter . But it is my first XP-L. All plastic parts . But my XP-M has worked well even though its made the same way.BUT I received the XP-L yesterday , and when I opened the box I could see that it was packaged so poorly . Lose parts rolling around , barely anything wrapped or contained . When I took all the parts out of the box , I inspected everything and right away saw that one of the plastic snaps on the outside of the canister was broken . Basically this means that it might not be water tight . Why would the top snaps be lose in the box in the first place , let alone made of plastic ? Makes no sense at all.Instantly I thought of returning to Amazon . But I noticed that there is an instruction sheet that stays STOP : before you send this product back call us at our 800 number and we will help you out . So I called the number . You go to an answering machine . `` Answering '' usually means someone listens to the messages and responds . Still waiting . Not to mention that the voice message says that for better service go to our website and you might find answers there too . Then I went to the manufacturers website , which is hard to navigate , offers almost no advice or way to contact anyone for return parts etc ... The website states the exact opposite from the packaging STOP letter . It says that you need to call the number for faster service else it could be several weeks before they get back to you . LOLIs this a joke company or what ? This is the year 2013 , nearly 2014 . The US economy has not really recovered and there are tons of canister makers out there . No wonder many companies with this poor of customer service go bankrupt . I would expect this one to follow suit too.Though these are cheaply made , you might get one that is whole . But if not , you will have to deal with the worse customer service and lack of care of any company I have come across in the last few years . This will be my last API Filstar filter . I will continue to wait with held breath for the elusive call or email back from this company.My final advice to everyone else is , do n't waste your time . There are better , equally affordable alternatives out there . Do not support a company that does not support you as a customer.UPDATE 12/14/13 - The MFG sent me an email asking if anyone called me yet ? Really ? You do n't know ? Then they said that it would be faster if I just sent it back through Amazon . HA ! In the normal business world it should be faster to go back directly through the MFG ! Sending back today through Amazon but never again buying anything from this MFG . Ridiculous !	-1
If you 're looking for a `` no-noise '' filter , I recommend buying a hang-on-back type filter . This canister filter is strong , the motor hums pretty loudly . Been using for 6 months now on a 60 gallon tank with 40 African Cichlids , even with an Aqua Clear 50 as a secondary filter , the xP3 needs bi-weekly cleaning . I have sand substrate and live plants so there is a lot going on . I have to clean it every other week now , the first 3 months it was working flawless without any cleaning . I guess it 's time to replace all the media , they 're pretty expensive ! For the price , it is not worth it ! I could have bought 5 x AquaClear 50 and they would have done a way better job ! ! !	-1
Bought for my 8 week old chihuahua she ate it only for a short time before refusing it . And it 's is not grain free	-1
My puppy really enjoyed this food . However , it always gave him loose runny stools which was a pain to clean up . We even tried to mix it with dried food but his stools never improved until we stopped feeding him this .	-1
I was really hoping this would help with terrible PH levels in my aquarium but on first use my angel fish started looking worse for wear , then recovered so I did n't think of anything of it , and on second use ( a few days later , as recommended on the bottle if the PH has n't gone down ) the angel fish died , and I realised too late what the culprit was . With one dead fish and zero change in my PH I stopped using the stuff ( also tried in a separate betta tank , which the betta survived , but the PH still did n't change ) . Since then I 've upped the water changes using filtered tap water , and my PH is now down from 8+ to 7.0 , all thanks to Brita .	-1
Really crappy . You will not get a uniform line of bubbles across the bank of your tank , no matter what you try . Bought a set of bubble stones within the same week and they work so much better . Did n't even bother spending the money to return this piece of junk .	-1
I needed another thermometer for the terrarium and purchased that on even though I 'm not a fan of the style . Well , once it 's attached , it 's on there . I was n't satisfied with its potition on the tank and ended up throwing it in the trash because it is not reusable . To me it was a waste of money . If you like and prefer this style of thermometer it might work for you , though . I prefer gadgets that I can detach and reposition as contitions change ( i.e . new habitat , redecorating etc . )	-1
The ball is heavier for distance throwing and the rubber is thicker . Any dog with strong bite will split the ball.Highly recommend the Kong Squeaker 3 inch tennis ball as replacement . Goes as far and is Alot stronger ! Too bad can not buy launcher only-ball is a waste of money	-1
we thought that the ball would be smooth like our neighbor 's ( which our dog loves ) , but is just a tennis ball . Check around and get another Chuckit instead .	-1
We played fetch with this twice and it was pulled apart . Not sturdy enough for the bulldogs to play with ...	-1
Dog loves it but it wo n't fly for long . Dog will cut through the shaping cord on the outside rims in no time flat . You ca n't leave it out for the dog when you are not there ( or paying attention ) .	-1
I bought this some months back . I have yet to get this thing to fly very well . Maybe I 'm not throwing it right , but it seems to just go up and then plummet back to earth . My dog likes the toy and plays with it , but my friend 's dog who likes to catch frisbees in mid-air , is frustrated because it does n't stay aloft long enough for him to catch it before it hits the ground .	-1
I 've owned a smaller squirrel in the past which my dog loved . It eventually deteriorated , but it held up for several years , so I cant complain . The dog loved it and it flew great.This new squirrel is horrible . I will not fly at all . Its like trying to toss a paperback book and attempting to make it fly . Im no novice when it comes to tossing a frisbee , i can throw a decent disc . This on the other hand is impossible . All it does is fly a couple feet , flip sideways , then upside down , then hits the ground hard . I could n't understand why others have no problem with the flight , so i did some research . Youtube showed some flying well and some having the same experience i did . I also found in a review , that someone mention this company was acquired by another company and perhaps the new models of these squirrels is a lot crappier . I wish i could get my money back . Regardless of the total fail of this product , the dog still loves it . But he would also love a flying paperback book ... or a rock ... .	-1
The large flying squirrel lasted about as long as a real one would ... one fling in the park and woochhh ... it was shedder on the first catch . Now , I have a Golden and a Lab/Pit-bull and they love each other and play very nicely together but , you throw in a cheap made dog toy and the flying squirrel is grounded !	-1
My puppy is n't one to rip his toys to shreds , but he managed to rip this apart in less than 30 minutes . This is the first Chuckit ! toy that I have n't rated 5 stars .	-1
If you are looking for a soft bite flyer , and like Chuckit , I 'd recommend the better flying Paraflight instead.The squirrel looks cute , but for my herding dog , not a good enough flyer.The best for super active retrieving working dogs , IMO , is still the Soft Bite Floppy Disc .	-1
Pouch does not close with 1 hand and the oil from the cookies stain the outer fabric . It is also awkward to clip to the waistband .	-1
Dissapointing- I love Kong products and have always bought them for our pets . They are by far superior . This one ... not so much . I am SURE it 's not a real Kong item because it 's terrible . If it was n't for Christmas I would return it but it 's not worth the hassle . The package came in a Kong package but it was tied with those clothing tags instead of the normal plastic ties used and the worst part is the furry part between the stick and the feathers is one flat piece- not closed ( sewn together as the pic shows ) and guess what . One small tug and the fur comes out everything . SOOO dissapointed .	-1
I offered the Halo treats to my cats several different times , but they only sniffed and licked it and then walked away . After several attempts we decided we wo n't eat it . Also to my displeasure , the contents of the envelope are turning to dust . Sorry , I ca n't recommend this product .	-1
The concept is good , the snack is nutritious , but in ordering from Amazon , there was practically nothing but dust in the bag . The couple of treats that were left uncrushed were practically air and my 71 pound dog looked at me as if I were playing a joke on her .	-1
I have returned this ! There are some hard pieces that will not allow me to crumble to put on pets ' food so they had to be thrown out . What are they ? Wood ? Not acceptable ! Returned and will not order again ! !	-1
We try to feed our cats wholesome healthy foods , so we thought these treats would be a great alternative to the kitty junk food they had been eating.Our 12yo girl cat sniffed these and turned up her nose . She is superrrrr picky , and lots of times will not consume something the first time you offer it to her , so no biggie.Our 2yo boy cat , as other reviewers described , went nuts . We gave him a few small bits ( maybe the equivalent of 3 regular cat treats in size ) and were delighted that we had found a treat he enjoys ( he does not like the treats typically found in supermarkets and such ) .About 24 hours later around 11pm we noticed he was straining to urinate , unproductive , and jumped in and out of the boxes about 15 times in 30minutes , growling and hissing at the box , and hissing at us when we tried to pet him or pick him up . He urinated on our bed , on his bed , on his pillow , and on the couch . This cat never urinated outside the box before ( except during car rides in his carrier ) and had never hissed before ( even at his evil , manipulative , bullying `` older sister '' cat that loves him dearly ) .We called the vet , who squeezes him in first thing in the morning , he had a uti . Several hundred dollars in medicine , overnight hospitalization , and aftercare , he is better.The only thing we changed in his diet ( or , for that matter , in his life ) in the two months leading up to his illness were these treats . After the vet told us UTIs were usually related to diet , we threw these out . We will probably never know exactly what caused his illness , but we have a sneaking suspicion ...	-1
My dog would not eat these Nutri-Vet Breath & Tartar Spearmint & Parsley Flavored Biscuits and I had to throw them out .	-1
She sniffed it , picked it up in her mouth and then tossed it to the side and ignored it until I removed it . Not a hit with her so I would n't buy again .	-1
My rabbits both enjoyed these toys ; however , after they chewed on them I noticed the inner core is plastic . Not healthy for sensitive digestive systems !	-1
I have a 6 month old golden retriever that tore the beak off within a day of getting it . The rest of the duck seems to be made well though and she enjoyed it while she could . Not for tough chewers .	-1
The bird is visually appealing . Our dog had the toy apart in 20 minutes . Parts inside I feel , pose a choke hazzard .	-1
Simple -- do not buy this toy . It may look reasonable , but the grey patch on its top is made of a tactile-almost sticky fiber . Proved to be easily pulled off . Its a problem for your dogs/small kids that could become life threatening . Within a few mins , one of our dogs starting coughing-became hacking fast . A trip to the vet made all right but we caught it fast .	-1
I bought this to mix things up after using the beef Sojos for a couple of months . I mix it in with dry food . If this is in it they wo n't touch their bowl . It 's heavy on grains , unlike the other flavors which include a lot of veggies .	-1
I was excited to get this organic cat nip for my new cat and my old cat that has never really cared for the nip . The old cat did sniff and lick a little bit of it up , but lost interest and never acted strangely . The new cat sniffed once and had no interest in it at all . Maybe this is good cat nip for another cat but it did n't affect mine at all . = (	-1
I purchased three tins of this catnap for myself and gifts.Total cats = 5Total cats that liked the product = 5Total cats that loved the product = 0So , I would just as soon buy cheaper alternatives that the cats seem to enjoy more.Nothing against this product , the cats just did n't love it as much as other products and it was rather pricey for that outcome .	-1
Well okay , actually two.1 . IIRC it was more costly than some other catnip offerings.2 . Even though it 's certified and organic my cat was quiteobviously completely indifferent to it.hmmm , maybe they sent certified organic oregano by mistake.ohhnoo ! maybe my cat is not a cat ! : OI would have sent it back but I forgot .	-1
I 've always purchased these type of crate beds for my six and eight year old boston terriers ' crates and decided to go with this one because of the price . I have bought many different brands over the years and never had an issue until I bought these . The quality of these beds are not good . These are not as dense and fluffy as ones that I 've bought in the past and these shed like crazy . It 's very annoying every time the pups come out of the crates and leave a trail of fuzz all over the house . I would not buy this brand again .	-1
A cheap and bad quality item . My dogs seem to prefer carpet over this . I guess I should n't have expected much from a $ 14 item . Take my advice : buy a different product .	-1
We bought 12 for our pet rescue ! BEWARE ! They FALL APART after washing ! Big balls of fleece clogged our washing machine costing us $ 75 to have the water pipe unclogged ! ! These things are junk ! Buy a reputable crate bed like Midwest or Slumber Pet . They last for years !	-1
It started & # 34 ; shedding & # 34 ; as soon as I got it . My 6 lb mini poodle was trying to get comfortable on it and the white & # 34 ; fleece & # 34 ; started coming off.Sent back and Amazon refunded my money right away .	-1
It is n't thick enough , so it slides around in the crate and ends up bunched and folded by the end of the day .	-1
i rec 'd this item and did return to amazon because this item did not have the thickness in the pad , my carpeting had more cushing for my dog as Stubby proved it by sleeping on the carpet instead of the pad	-1
The photo of this mat looks like it would be pretty padded but it is n't at all . It 's quite thin . The back has vinyl dots so it 's supposed to grip the crate pan , but in my car it ends up sliding around with the dog on it and being bunched up . Here are my comments to two claims they make in the product description : - Luxurious plush sleeper bed for both dogs and cats - not luxurious feeling - maybe luxurious looking but it 's just fake fur- Non Skid backing for secure placement - definitely not secureIt was inexpensive , so you get what you pay for . I would not buy this again .	-1
Does not survive the washing machine . My dog literally chewed it up after it went through the washing machine and became frayed .	-1
Quality is not great for the price , would not buy again . You can find a similar item for less money and better quality .	-1
I bought this for my 5 months old Jack Russell , but it is too thin and she colds - so much that she wo n't sleep on it . I now use it under another bed to keep her extra warm . It might work for the car or inside a crate , but I still think it 's a bit too thin .	-1
Based on reading many reviews - I assume the deminsions listed for this product are incorrect . Amazon you must change , according to many people it is a flat matt not 4 inches thick as lsited in the dimensions 4 x 18 x 11 inches .	-1
These are a very low quality product . Our family researches all things we put into our bodies and our animals ' bodies . We found this is a pitiful supplement and is a waste of money . Hardy Pet Nutrition , Lifestage , NuPro and Only Natural Pet are all much better quality . It 's also recommended to change brands on supplements to give the body different nutrients . We 've been doing this for ourselves and our pets . If your pet does n't like the taste of the powdered types , try liquids . They also are more bio-available to the body so we get more out of them . Taking a multi-vitamin/mineral is good for all of us ... pets , too .	-1
These tablets must have something special in them , my dog was super hyperactive after eating them . Bouncing off the walls , very crazy . I 'd like to believe she gets enough vitamins from her daily food , so I ca n't account for the strange increase in craziness . It was n't just energy , it was like she had less focus and was much more distracted . When I stopped feeding these to her , she went back to normal . These tablets are made in India according to the package , not sure if that has anything to do with anything ( I 'm one of those paranoid dog owners that wo n't feed my dog anything from China - have n't heard anything specific about India though ) . Anyway , I 'm sure these are working well for others , just my two cents on my experience .	-1
Although product seems to help our dog 's arthritis in short time we have tried to use it both times ( 2 weeks each time ) , our 120 lb mastiff/shepherd does NOT tolerate this product well . She loses appetite on this product and frequently vomits morning after tablets are given . Symptoms disappeared within 2 days of discontinuing product.I wasted a lot of money it seems.If you buy , hope your animal has better tolerance for this supplement .	-1
I bought the toothpaste and there were some weird green fibers in there . My dog sniffed at it and turned his head away . So I called the manufacturer , ( 800 ) 338-3659 , to ask them what the green fibers were . They did send a pick-up for lab test but later never returned my phone call when I asked for the result ( I called many times . When I called this company no one ever answers the phone . I do n't know if it 's going out of business or what . But I would n't dare to purchase any more product from this company .	-1
This toothpaste is ok but does n't get my dog 's teeth as shiny and white as the CET toothpaste I normally get . I thought I would try this one since it cost less . I also would have preferred to have 2 toothbrushes instead of the finger brush . The finger brush is so soft as to be useless . I have a 2 year old Chow-Newfoundland . I brush his teeth every night and after a week there was nothing left of the finger brush ! I would rather spend a little more and get the CET toothpaste from another vendor that also has free shipping . Do n't buy CET via Amazon 's 3rd party sellers or you will have to pay for shipping .	-1
My Havanese will not let me use the brush in his mouth , nor does he like the taste of the toothpaste . To be fair , I have tried since he was a puppy , and have just not found a good combination he will tolerate !	-1
My dog hated this ! The toothbrush is an awkward shape and the finger brush was a plastic piece that just seemed messy and did n't do much . I smelled the paste ( that my dog spit out ) and it made me gag . Do n't waste your money .	-1
My puppy hates baths and I thought I would try this waterless shampoo as an alternative to a bath . I used the product exactly as per the instructions but it didnt clean my puppy one bit ! He is pure white , so it is pretty easy to see if a product has helped clean him up or not.The only reason I have given it two stars is that it is like using a good conditioner . It makes my puppy 's fur very smooth and soft and makes him smell really good !	-1
I used this product on all 3 of my pets , all with the same result . They initially smell good , but within a day they stink worse than they did before . It as if this stuff absorbs all the odors they come in contact with . I tried several more times , using less and less each time , all with the same result .	-1
This product is promoted as safe for puppies but my nine week old Boston Terrier has choked on them . He is able to bite the tip off with his razor sharp teeth and has no regard for how big the piece is . They only last maybe 20 minutes tops . I wo n't buy them again because even while being supervised my pup is fast and can down large chunks before I realize it , and after choking twice on these bones ... no more Nylabone Edibles for Petey !	-1
My very average chewing dog was done with it in under 5 minutes . I was hoping that for this kind of money this bone would last a little longer . Next time , I 'll simply get her rolled pig skins . They last about 10 minutes , are filled with yummy paste and they cost so much less .	-1
I sprayed a few things with this spray and my dog loves the taste . She chews right on it . She thinks it is a treat for her !	-1
My Boxer and Lab mix chewed on everything , both breeds are notorious to be horrible chewers . Although the product worked on table legs ... . that was it . The puppy would lick my hands after application and lick the table legs , and then attempt to chew my hands again . Thank god she just turned 9 weeks old and is starting to obey commands for not biting and chewing .	-1
I do n't know if it 's just my dog or what but he seemed to like the taste , it seemed like it made him target the areas sprayed more .	-1
I tried this for my cat , as I read that it will deter both cats and dogs . The cat could n't care less . The puppy , on the other hand - not so happy about this spray . So definitely better for dogs .	-1
My cat has & # 34 ; hot spots & # 34 ; where he 's licked himself to the point of bleeding in some places . I 've taken him to the vet several times ( tested for allergies , etc . ) , but he continues to lick himself . I thought I would give this a try ; maybe it would taste so bad he would stop . He did make a face , but then proceeded to lick it right off . It did n't work for me , but I 'm going to give my bottle to a friend who 's dog is chewing her baseboards . Maybe it will work for her .	-1
I think the evaporating solution is more of a put off for my puppy than the taste . 5 minutes after application she doesnt mind the taste : (	-1
My Rottie went though a very long teething/chewing phase as a puppy and of course liked to chew on expensive things like oriental rugs . I tried everything with no luck at all - nothing seemed to even slow her down . I was so sure that the Bitter Apple would work - unfortunately , I learned that some dogs actually LIKE the taste of Bitter Apple and mine happens to be one of them . That said , about 75 % of the folks I have talked with swear by this product and have had great results . If you happen to be one of the unlucky folks whose dog does n't mind the taste , try using red pepper instead .	-1
Ok , maybe my dog is weird but this did n't deter him at all , he was in the puppy chewing phase and let me tell you , he would just like this stuff right up . At first it seemed like he did n't like it- that lasted about 10 minutes , and then he was right back chewing it again . Maybe it works for some dogs , but definitely not mine !	-1
I got this thinking it works on anything you spray it on , but beware , it only works while it is still wet . Once it dries , which is fairly quickly , the taste seems to no longer affect my dog . He hates the bottle and the taste makes him jump back , but he also knows the taste will be gone soon , so he will wait for a minute and go at it again . I 'm thinking the best way to get dogs to stop biting and chewing is to train it very strictly or put it in obedience school if you can afford to .	-1
When first sprayed , my dog wants nothing to do with it . After 5 minutes and it has dried , back to licking and chewing . Not very effective .	-1
I am deeply involved in the rescue of retired , racing Greyhounds and have been for more than 11 years . Aside from owning my own Greys ( at one time 8 but now just 5 ) , I also foster which includes caring for those beautiful creatures newly retired that must be spayed/neutered . I had one particular foster dog who was more than overzealous in licking and biting at her sutures following her spay and the vet recommended this product . While it did n't work for that particular dog , I had it on hand so began using it for other things over the years like hot spot-licking , small wound licking , wall licking ( yeah , wall licking ... right through to the stud ) , boredom licking ( habits formed at the track ) ... no matter what the use , no matter which dog , this stuff just did n't prevent licking at all.When my friend got a new puppy ( Germ Shep ) , she borrowed this to keep her baby from biting at her spay sutures and it worked perfectly . She had to spritz her girl just twice and that gal left her suture site alone until well healed . So , it does work , just not for me and mine.hmmm , wonder if it just another one of those unique but corny `` Greyhound things '' ... .	-1
I , like melissak , put WAY too much hope in these bottles of spray . I was honestly and really thinking that this spray would keep my puppy away from the wood she so dearly loves to gnaw . Wrong . I am not sure why I put all of my hope eggs in this bitter apple spray basket ... if this spray worked for all dogs , would n't everyone use it ? ! And would n't every puppy come with a bottle ? Or would people have to order the combo puppy with spray bottle and Kong ? Anyway ... I sprayed the , um , spray on the wooden furniture . My puppy sniffed it , walked away , came back to gnaw some more . Bummer . I think that the efficacy of the spray depends on the tastebuds of the dog . My puppy happens to believe that mulch , cigarette butts , rocks , and other disgusting sundried items on the sidewalk taste absolutely delish so maybe this bitter apple is like dessert for her .	-1
my english bulldog was a powerful chewer already at 10 weeks . we bought this to deter him from chewing on his crate and everything else in the house , but it did n't work . he seemed to love the taste and i suffered because it stained my fingers and no matter how many times i washed them , i would taste it on my hand for the next few days.. i 'm glad i saved my receipt and took it back to the pet store ... it 'd definitely deter a thumbsucker or nail biter , but i don ; t think humans can use it ... lol	-1
This absolutely did not work and it smells like regular apple vinegar that you would get at the grocery store .	-1
I thought this stuff would taste worst but actually I tried it and it 's not as bitter as I thought it would be . Point being , my dog had no problem bitting the spots on him I sprayed . Maybe it 'll work better on your dog .	-1
My puppy has chewed through 3 leashes and I 've tried all sorts of `` remedies '' including this one . It deterred her for a few minutes but then I guess she just did n't mind it . In the end , what worked was clicker training her for another more appropriate behaving `` leave it '' .	-1
Did n't see a big difference in the amount of shedding , however , my dog did love to eat these . I finally bought some omega pills that seem to help .	-1
The buffer is useless . Ph will rebound very quickly . I read some review and then bought it , please do n't mislead buyer .	-1
The item as shown is a large plastic bottle with a handle and screw-on lid , which is what I was expecting and wanting . Instead I got a plumped up plastic bag with a press-down seal at one end , which is a struggle to open and close , and inconvenient to store . How can the shipping weight be listed as over 8 pounds when it 's 4 lbs of seed in a plastic bag inside a lightweight box ? The actual weight is less than 5 lbs and these $ 10+ shipping charges are a ripoff . My parakeets are eating it ( except for the large pieces -- why do they add them when most parakeets do n't like them ? ) , but they do n't seem to like this food any better than the regular seed I 've always bought for them .	-1
Matrix is really a great product , but do yourself a favor and buy it from somewhere you can inspect the package before you purchase . I did n't realize that I was ripped off until recently seeing this at my local fish store . The package I received did NOT have a seal on the inside of the lid . Also most of the rocks looked like plain gravel . I thought it was a little weird , but without knowing for sure I did n't complain.The real Seachem Matrix comes SEALED ! And all the little rock pieces are extremely porous inside , and very light.Buy online at your own risk . Mine had about 5 % actual Seachem Matrix and 95 % similar colored gravel .	-1
Used it a couple of times and Purigen leaches through the bag only leaving half the Purigen . At this rate I will only get about 5 uses for the price this makes it extremely expensive .	-1
I bought this after seeing reviews raving about it . My tank was still having a new tank haze after about 2 months and several partial water changes . After 2 days of this being in my filter the tank just got more hazey . I wont be purchasing again .	-1
I have tanks with this product and without this product . There is no discernible difference between them . Water quality and clarity are the same with or without . As this stuff is pricey , doubt I will be using it again .	-1
Bought on Amazon I was anxious to try the product , but mesh bag was perforated and contents spilled out all over the sink and counter . Put remnant in panty hose and placed in filter-no change except for particles flowing into the tank . Requesting replacement from SeaChem , but no response yet .	-1
Ok , so I know there are people who are big supporters of this product and they will not appreciate any negative reviews of it . ( I used to be one of them ) . But I have to give an honest review so please hear me out . Two of my tanks crashed after using regenerated Seachem . I am not saying this product itself caused it - I believe the use of BLEACH in the process of regeneration caused it . I followed the directions to use bleach to regenerate . I even doubled the Prime to neutralize the bleach after regenerating.Everything was going fine ( my tanks had been cycled for years ) then one day my tanks crashed . The only change was that I had started using regenerated Purigen . Ammonia and nitrites were reading at the highest level on the chart . The beneficial bacteria was gone . Some of my fish died , some got ich and some got fin rot . So I 'm just saying be careful using BLEACH on anything you plan on putting in your aquarium if your aquarium is cycled . It has taken me a month to get the ammonia and nitrites back to zero . I treated the ich using medicines and am still giving some fish antibiotics to treat the severe fin rot.For me any benefits do not outweigh the risks and I am not using Purigen again . I will keep my tanks cycled to control ammonia and use floss to keep the water polished.If you are going to use this , be very careful using the regeneration process . Using strips to test for chlorine on the purigen before putting it in the filter would be a good idea . Or use the product once then toss it . I am just sharing my experience.UPdate 1-1-14 : My tanks have been stable , everything within parameters , since I quit using this product . No crashes , no ammonia or nitrite spikes .	-1
I know A LOT of people like this product , which is why I got it . The activated carbon performed fine in my tank and the only reason I decided to buy the Purigen was from its popularity and I wanted to give my tank the best possible . I 've also used a bunch of the products from Seachem and I absolutely love the company.It took about 2 months until the Purigen began clogging up my filtration and needed to be `` regenerated '' and this is where my problems stem from . I 'm meticulous when it comes to details and I followed them perfectly from the Seachem website . I even went above and beyond by letting it sit days longer in the dechlorinator then called for.Despite my efforts something happened in the regeneration process and it resulted in the death of my fish and shrimp that I kept in the tank shortly after I added the purigen back to the tank , including the babies unfortunately . Due to how well the tank was doing ( the fact that both shrimp and fish were giving birth , no deaths , etc ) the only explanation I could think of was the regenerated purigen . I 'm 100 % confident that I followed the regeneration process perfectly and based on the input from others who have regenerated their purigen with no ill effects I ca n't really put the blame on anyone . Something happened , and neither I nor Seachem can explain it.I switched back to Activated Carbon and I wo n't use Purigen ever again , but I still recommend Seachem products to anyone , just not this one .	-1
I added this to my external filter in place of my charcoal in a tank with my 18 & # 34 ; Pleco , which I have had for over 2 years . I know how to take care of this fish ! I was doing a partial water change . I changed out 1/2 the water , rotated shells to in back to bring forward accessibility to new algea growth . Added room temperature water with dechlorination and slime coat additive . I changed out 1/2 the mechanical filter media , tossed my bag charcoal from the filter , added the seachem which I soaked first in water I removed from the tank and rinsed . I gave him more zuchinni ( loved it ) . Came back an hour later and he was listing , unable to attach to the sides , driftwood , food source - etc . I started freaking that the water was bad . I pulled out the Seachem , started water changing again - checked temp and heater - all good . Another hour and he was dead . I am still ready to cry . What went wrong ! ! ? ? ? I am sure the Seachem killed him ( his nickname was Godzilla -- pretty hardy guy too ) .	-1
I did n't anticipate the beads and a white residue ( even through I rinsed thoroughly ) to leak through the mesh bag . Today I noticed that my spunky little beta was barely moving , then saw there was a white residue building up inside the aquarium walls and little white beads all over the plants . Just did a water change two days ago , and am uncertain what to do at this point . Purchased the Seachem Purigen 100 ml bag for the Aqueon Evolve 8 LED Aquarium Kit , 8 gallons . The water has a white/cloudy appearance . Put back the original filter for this new aquarium , and hoping that will clean some of this out with the help of the air bubbler which moves the water very well , but gently .	-1
I really wanted to love this product , with all the amazing reviews how could I not ? Let me start out by telling you I 'm not new to aquariums . I have plenty of experience . I have a 200 Gallon High Tech Planted Discus Aquarium . Pressurized CO2 with reactor , High LED Lighting , Flourite Sand , Eheim 2080 Pro Filter , Dual GFO / Carbon Reactors and a UV Sterilizer . I hope that gives you a good idea of what I put into my setup.So I had an issue with some algae taking over my plants . My friend suggested I buy Flourish Excel and a glass spray bottle . Make sure the fish are on one side of the tank and spray the flourish on the plants that are coated with algae and it will kill the algae growth . Done deal . Followed his instructions to a T. Well within a couple of hours after applying the solution . I started to see my fish look sick , one discus was laying on its side and the others were at the surface gulping for air . The snails are crawling to the surface as well . ( always a tell tell sign when snails want out somethings wrong with your water ) . I immediately did a 50 % water change . By this point one cardinal tetra was dead . Even after the water change the fish were still acting strange and I knew it would take an entire emptying of the tank to save my $ 1K in discus fish . I ended up doing a total of 3 50 % water changes to get this product out of the water . I 've read forums and blogs of others having this exact same issue after dosing their tanks with this product . Most thought it was water flow and lack of surface movement . I have two huge air stones moving water and a spray bar . Lack of oxygen is not the issue here . I believe there is something toxic in this product . Have you ever opened the bottle and smelled it ? It smells like household cleaner . 6 hours into this mess and I have lost 2 cardinal tetras . I will not be using or referring this product to anyone . I just hope in the morning when I wake up there will be no other casualties . This product should be recalled and retested for FISH aquariums . Plants are second and fish are always first in my book . This could have cost me my entire collection of discus . A couple nights earlier I put a small amount into the tank to see how the fish would respond . They did act a little odd and the smell from the chemical lingered in the room for hours . I should have known then not to use this product . Okay so I do n't usually share reviews however this was such a nightmare to deal with I did n't want anyone else to go through it .	-1
The cap is poorly designed as is difficult to remove and put back on.Product was leaking when I opened the box and it is a nasty blue dye that stains everything it touches.My blue ram who had a fungus ( maybe hole in the head ) was sick for about 3 weeks and died the day after I put this in ...	-1
Used this for several days and it clearly does n't work . I have tried several products and will continue to try more to get rid of the ich in my tank . This stuff appeared to have no affect at all .	-1
The dosing instructions go on a `` per 10G '' dose . I was using this on a 10G and ramped up from 1.25ml each day until I hit the 5ml per 10G dose . At 2.5ml my fish started to act strangely ... should have reduced the dose then . By the fourth day 4 fish had died . Three of those fish had shown no signs of disease as I was treating only 2 ... which are still alive . Seems like it `` attacked '' the healthy fish . The remaining ones are still covered in ick and my xenia is barely hanging on . Snails all curled up and dropped off the glass and rock on the day I added the full cap ( 5ml ) . I would go with a half or quarter dose and REALLY watch the reaction in the tank . I 've now been doing daily water changes and things are SLOWLY getting back to normal as the medicine is diluting . I will only be using this as a dip if I ever even use it again .	-1
This test has one tray with small bowls ( kind of like contact lens holder size but shallower ) . It requires taking tweezers ( provided ) and taking a tiny yellow dot and putting it in tank water , adding a drop of one chemical to one of the bowls . After 10 minutes , you are supposed to compare the yellow dot 's new color with a color chart . One dot did n't change and the other one was MAYBE a slightly lighter yellow , which was n't an option on the color chart . It was expensive and not helpful . I would return it if I could , but since I actually used the product , I wo n't try .	-1
Sprayed on damp and dry elderly shih tzus who have had long standing itchy skin issues . They continued to chew , lick and scratch . Also , I personally think that tea tree oil smells bad . Not a winner .	-1
I was not impressed by this product . It did not help with my dogs itching . I wanted to try something all natural and was hoping this would work .	-1
I hate to disagree with the majority of reviewers , but there is something about this brand , which we recently tried . It seems to upset my dog 's stomach and she does n't like it . I thought maybe there was something wrong with this bottle of product , so I tried another bottle , purchased elsewhere , with the same result . And I tried using a smaller dose . Quite perplexed , as my dog does fine with other brands , but not this one . Guess we will stick with the other brands .	-1
would not be a big deal except my dogs do not care for fish and wo n't eat their food when I add this ... ca n't comment on how effective it is	-1
I bought this to help my dogs ' dry skin but I did n't notice a bit of difference . The only good thing is that it does n't smell like fish too badly and it helped my dogs want to eat their dry food . But I do n't think I 'd buy it again .	-1
My vet recommended that we give my Aussie some fish oil so we found this as an alternative to pills . The price is right and when we first began using it my dog was thrilled with the taste . We live in Colorado so it is stored in a cool dry climate but the taste seemed to spoil after a few weeks of use . My dog began pushing her bowl around in protest . We changed the bowl and gave her un-oiled food ( same batch as we were using in conduction with the oil ) and she resumed her normal eating habits . We tried another bottle of the oil a week later with the same results . Not sure if we got a bad batch or if the shelf-life for this product is just too short .	-1
I just bought a bottle of this . Next morning I put 1 squirt on Roxy 's food . She ate it up , no problem . 10 minutes later , entire breakfast came back up - smelling really , really bad . She has never thrown up before . Into the trash can went the fish oil ... based on other reviews this works well , but not with my young Standard Poodle !	-1
I do n't know if it 's my dog , he does n't like this stuff at all , and to me , it smells really weird , like there are some harsh chemicals in it . I do n't know if I got a bad batch , but this was my experience .	-1
I give one pump at dinner and am about half through the bottle . So far , I am disappointed and ca n't tell a difference in his scratching .	-1
This is the third time the packer has not screwed on the top adequately and it leaked all over the interior of the box and saturated to the exterior . Yes , it was placed in a zip lock bag but even then it leaked out . I suspect UPS is n't too excited to return a box that is leaking and smells of fish oil . Thus I have to find another box to ship it in . The other two times this happened I decided to clean all the oil off the 64oz bottle and use it anyway -- not this time . Every time this happens I lose several ounces of fish oil . I 'm returning for a replacement . I can get a gallon of bug spray from Amazon without issue.Update : I got a replacement quickly , and even the top on this bottle was not screwed on tightly and it too leaked out ! ! ! Too much trouble to return yet again so had to shampoo the exterior of the bottle and leave it in the garage to avoid smelling up the house . Just now much extra effort does it take to screw the bottle top on an item ? ? ? NOT ordering this product again . If they are this careless with the packaging how meticulous are they in their formulation practices ? There are comparable and cheaper alternatives on Amazon . If you have multiple dogs you can order a gallon of high quality wild caught salmon oil in three different formulas for about $ 60 at Jewards International.Update 6/21/13 : Finally . A better product . Life Line Wild Alaskan Salmon Oil for Dogs and Cats can be found on Amazon and is about the same price as Grizzly . The color is the richest amber I have seen in salmon oils which is probably an indicator of its richness and lack of processing . It is a tiny bit thicker than Icelandic or Grizzly . It smells no worse than the others and because of it 's air tight packaging I can leave it in the house . This company is brilliant by not using a pump dispenser , which I believe can allow air to enter the product and possibly cause oxidation . The smaller squeeze bottle has this air tight flap or valve which allows the oil to exit but air can not enter thereby preserving freshness . I have held it upside down and it is absolutely leak proof . Life Line comes in various sizes with a large 64 oz size to refill the handy , smaller bottle . Performance ? ? Since using it the coats of my Malinois just gleams and the hair loss has reduced . I 've used salmon oils for decades and none of the other oils had ever had that effect on their coats . A testament to the quality and richness of Life Lines oil . I recommend it to my obedience marker training clients .	-1
Not sure if it was the product or my dog , but she refused to eat her food when I put this one it , and she usually has a great appetite .	-1
it took too much to use up for 3 dogs they liked it but I dont like it . I wont try again	-1
I love the product , but this shipment was a mess ! It leaked all over , it was a mess . Had to throw it away .	-1
Product description on this page does not disclose that this product contains rosemary ( used as a natural preservative ) . Unfortunately ( in my experience ) , most cats do not like rosemary . Additionally , there is some controversy whether rosemary is even safe for cats to ingest as cat biology can not handle most plant essential oils safely . Dogs should have no problem with this ( same salmon oil is sold for both dogs and cats , just different packaging ) , but I would look elsewhere if you have cats . Amazon customer service processed a return credit for me on this item with no issues - one of the reasons I like shopping here so much ! Thanks Amazon ! ! !	-1
3 different cats wo n't consume this product . Stinky too . I had purchased GNC Salmon Oil and they like that product much better and lap it up . I will not purchase this again .	-1
I purchased this oil because of the statements on the site . I wanted to add some extra fish oil to the cat 's diet . This was not the product to duo it	-1
Do n't buy it . I tried to see if this was unpurified and the company really gave me the runaround . It was not clear whether or not it was so I am betting it is not . No animal should have to eat mercury or pcb tainted salmon oil . Yes it is cheap but now I know why . It could even be from farmed salmon . Spend more and get some that is purified . Many human brands are but check first .	-1
I have three cats , the youngest is eight , the oldest is 14 . None are showing signs of arthritis or joint problems and have no problems jumping up onto windows or cat furniture . But I saw this product has Omega-3 and figured it would be good for the cats . I give them wet food as a treat every couple of weeks and added a small squirt to their `` tuna '' . One cat is a bit picky , one will eat just about anything and the third is a chow hound . Of the three cats NOT ONE would touch this stuff ! They would n't even try to eat the wet food and leave the salmon oil . And the cats seem to like fish flavored treats/food better than any other flavor . I tried this a second time and they still hated it . I put it out before going to work in the morning and it was all still uneaten when I returned from work . So I ca n't tell if this product is effective , but I was dismayed when not one cat would touch this product .	-1
I sprinkle a little of this on their food and they wo n't eat . I looks like flour in the bottle . It makes a gross gooey mess on the inside of the bowls . Many great reviews for this was the reason I purchased but my cats ( 3 of them ) do n't like it . I use FortiFlora and they gobble that right up .	-1
My dog did not care for this powder at all and his stools actually became loose from it . I guess he did n't need it . I was hoping it would help his itchy skin and ears . Guess I will keep searching for an answer to his allergies .	-1
I was excited to use this , but one by one all three of my animals started puking . Made one of my cats very itchy and constipated too . I am returning it .	-1
I did n't feel like the product was working as well as it should have.Too bad , after all the positive reviews i wanted this product to work . We have used thePurina Veterinary Diets Fortiflora Canine , 30 Sachets Per Boxbefore and that has worked well.Because of the higher price of both of these i switched toVetri-Mega Probiotic ( 120 Caps ) and they have been working great , and less mess to boot because they come in capsule form that i just drop in his food ( he is a lab and has n't minded the taste of any of the probiotics he has ever had , whether it be the powder or a capsule ) .At least i found an option that works better and is cheaper as well for my dog . Try the Vetri-Mega first and see .	-1
This is a good idea , but it 's not good for bigger pills . Anything larger than the size of 1/2 a tic tac this product does n't work well with .	-1
I purchased this to replace a broken pill gun . The pill gets stuck in the plastic end every time instead of going into the cats mouth	-1
We thought this would be a great piller to get for our cats , since it had a nice slender stick.WRONG ! The little rubber end does hold a pill fairly effectively . However , it relies on the stickto push the pill into the cat 's mouth effectively.This only happens some of the time with this item.It is hard for the human to hold both the cat and the piller , and nearly impossible topush the plunger part . When we tried it with two people , it was a little better , but stilljust an annoying design . There is not enough place for your hand to grip the plunger portion ( and I do n't have big hands ) .This one - I just ca n't recommend it . It is too awkward to use the plunger.UPDATE : I realized I could use links for anything else sold on Amazon , so I will gladly share the model we love. -- - > Bullseye Pillgun & lt ; -- -- This is sturdy and easy to use . It holds as small as 1/4 of a pill pretty well.We have one cat who needs antihistamines , so I use this at least twice a week.Our other cat would rather see you dead before taking a pill , so to say that this one helpsget it down ( with two people ! ) says a lot too - I 've found that rubbing a little gravy aroundthe tip helps the medicine go down ! : ) I 've even used a little squeeze cheese on the tip , because she likes it ! The piller is very sturdy , and the hard plastic tube on the outside allows cats to chew or bite itwithout ruining it , or catching your fingers . The plunger is also sturdy . I have two now , because Ihave one for each cat . That is n't probably necessary , but I like to do it that way.Be sure to put the piller in the RIGHT SIDE of the cat 's mouth - you have a less chance of the pillgoing down the windpipe that way . Also , please be sure to give your cat some food or a treat after the pillto be sure it goes all the way to the tummy . If they do n't swallow enough , the pill can start dissolving intheir esophagus ( just like with humans ) , and can cause damage that way.I also blow across their nose while holding their mouth shut , which makes them swallow too ...	-1
I wish I had the results others have who gave this piller 4 stars . The capsules I tried to give my cats got stuck and I ended up doing it the old fashioned way . The plunger does n't seem to come out far enough to really give the gel capsule ( it was flea pill ) a decent push down the gullet . Disappointing..	-1
I 've tried this product a couple of times and it turns my nice clear fish tank water into pond water - I 've had to completely start my tank over within a week and a half both times I 've used this product .	-1
Followed the instruction exactly . I 'm 1 week in and my ammonia still continues to rise with 0 nitrite or nitrate . Feels like I just paid 12 dollars for a bottle of water . Will probably return this .	-1
I am in the process of moving my colony of Cherry Shrimp , Celestial Pearl Danios , and Corydoras Hasbrosus from their outgrown 10g into a 20g long . I have started by slowly moving their plants and driftwood over , as well as using the sponge from their filter in a temporary filter and Seachem Stability . It has been over a week of dosing Stability along with liquid plant fertilizers every day and I was getting ammonia readings the entire time . Last night I got a HUGE ammonia spike . I have no idea how the bladder snails that hitchhiked their way into their new mansion early are still living . All I can say is thank goodness I did n't move my expensive to replace fish over on day one . I used it according to instructions , doing 2 capfuls on day 1 and 1 capful every day after that . But basically the tank is just cycling normally and it could be another three weeks for it to be ready to go.This is the first Seachem product I have n't loved . Really disappointing ! I used API Stress Zyme+ when setting up my 10g tank and IMO it worked much better .	-1
I have been experimenting with different biological filter starters and so far this one is the worst of them . I 've been through Jungle Start Zyme ( Walmart ) , Seachem Stability , Tetra Safestart , and Nutrafin Cycle.All of these products seem to have decent Ammonia- > Nitrite ( Nitrosomonas ) bacteria , but only Tetra Safestart and Nutrafin had effective Nitrite- > Nitrate ( Nitrobacter ) bacteria . In fact , I was able to get a pretty solid cycle going on day 3 with Tetra Safestart . Stability had very little effect overall and the bottle is perfectly within its shelf life.Not impressed .	-1
My husband sprained his wrist , so I was in charge of trying to put this into the ground on our camping trip . It had rained the night before so the dirt on the ground was reasonably soft . I tried to screw the stake into the dirt , but it just would n't stay . I put all my weight into it and it just kind of grazed the top . The top handle does n't have any sort of comfort - just a piece of metal . So unless you have a strong grip ( I do not ) this does n't work very well . If it had screwed into the ground , I 'm sure it would have held up since the metal seemed to be very sturdy .	-1
These do not work , too thin and too small !	-1
These look just like the feminine pads you buy at Walmart but a lot more expensive and not very many . Your better off buying the same product at Walmart . They do n't really stay well in the diaper either .	-1
I used this for my 15yr old lab Bailey who has since left me sadly in October of 2011 . This was the best thing I came across to use for his little drip issue we were having . I just remodeled and I wanted to be comfortable and I wanted him to be comfortable as well . Bailey knew he had an issue as he tried constantly to clean up after himself , I started using this and he was so much happier ! Now a few pointers ! ! The pads are not worth the money ! ! They are not very absorbent , They do not stick well at all and if they get a tad damp forget it they fall off , they crunch up in the wrap making them useless and more expensive the female products soooooo ... I used Poise Ultra Absorbent people pads inside and they were fantastic VS the Simple Solutions pads which sadly were terrible and a total waste of money . Simple Solution pads are just over priced expensive Kotex pads that could not handle the amount of urine that can occur unlike the Poise pads , remember this is what Poise pads are used for . You should get the ones that fit how much you dog drips so it may take some experimenting my dog was large so mine were the most absorbent I could get . Great thing is you can get them in-store and on sale almost anywhere ! I bought baby wipes to wipe him down and keep him clean , remember it is the same concept as a baby wearing a diaper and sitting in it , I did n't want to risk any infection . No alcohol ! Make sure you measure your dog , to tight can cause a lot of chafing ! ! Mine was the right size but I ended up sewing micro-fiber cloth on the elastic part where the material scrunched up as this was causing chafing behind his manly area . He was not use to anything rubbing his skin in that area and the material is pretty stiff . I had to leave it off till it healed and sadly I never had the chance to see if the microfiber would have relieved the problem . Make sure you check your dog to make sure this is not occurring due to some dogs have a higher tolerance to pain . It would be great if they could use a softer material in the elastic area . I wish they were a tad cheaper in price , I did purchase one at Petsmart and the other on Ebay for a fraction of the cost , if you do n't mind used ( they are washed ! ! ) it 's a deal ! I would recommend but def do some shopping as they are not cheap !	-1
Okay , these are cheaply made , and you can get panty liners at the grocery for less and they work the same . Save your money go to the grocery .	-1
Ridiculous , you can buy panty liners ( store brand ) for 99 cents , same exact thing . Why pay for the name Simple Solution . They make a great cleaning solution however .	-1
Got these today - a waste of money . They are so thin that the dog dribbled through them in about 5 minutes . They are basically cheap mini-pads like you 'd buy in the women 's section of the grocery store . Or the dollar store . That cheap . Do n't bother .	-1
I tried to get my dog to use the puppy pad easier by using this , but he actually was afraid of the smell and peed right next to the puppy pad . What worked is actually spraying lavender on the puppy pad and he went right away on it . Go for the all natural solutions and save your money .	-1
used to help pottie train my puppies on the pee pads but they did n't seem like the spray did any good I would not buy again	-1
Tried and tried this stuff but the dogs just wo n't go 'there'.They did n't seem to like the smell and stay away from it !	-1
i have a yorkie . notoriously known for being difficult to house break . this product did nothing for my puppy . wherever i sprayed it just made him want to lay in the spot but pee everywhere else .	-1
this doesnt work . followed instrucions but dog never responded to it . threww it away after several attemps . I wont recommend this to anybody	-1
Our puppy thinks this is an interesting smell and all , but it does not encourage her to use the bathroom there . We bought this with an indoor fake grass mat thing , and she is too afraid of both of them to use it ( she was originally trained to use only outdoors ) . Oh well ! Worth a try .	-1
The title should explain it all . Of anything I ever got for my puppy this and the potty pad are two of my biggest regrets . Useless and unnecessary . Never saw this spray work once ... .going to have to stuff it my purse and use it as a pepper spray substitute just to stretch my dollar .	-1
It worked the first few times I used it to get my pup to pee in the mulch bed instead of on the lawn , but now it seems to have no affect and she is back to the lawn .	-1
Our new tween-aged dog ignored it completely . we even poured out a large puddle of this and she tried to drink it . not exactly the intended result . save your money and get a book . or just get someone else 's dog to visit your yard .	-1
I received this product in a timely manner , however , my puppies did n't react to it as the instructions say they would ... I do n't know if it is just my puppies or if it is the product ... .	-1
I bought this for my new puppy , be he just ignored the sprayed area . One of my cats , which knew how to use litter already , ended up peeing on the sprayed doggie pee pad . I think it really depends on pets =/	-1
Did not work at all . It was sent all the way from a pet store in England . I used it three times then threw it away .	-1
I think you 're better off saving your money and training your dog the old fashion way . If anything , this made our Miniature Dachshund run the other way . Once I stopped using this she started doing her business in the right spot .	-1
I bought 2 100 % wool custom made 9 x 12 area rugs at an estate sale recently . Actually they were a matching pair . One must have been in the living room and was spotless . The other one must have been in the dining room and it had food stains as well as what appeared to be uncleaned small dog or cat urine stains ... .all over the rug . But with my Bissell top of the line carpet machine I was pretty confident I could successfully remove these urine stains . First I pre treated each urine stain with the trigger spray Extreme ... ... 4 times allowing the rug to thoroughly dry between applications . Since it was an area rug I could see when it was wet on the back of the area being treated etc . I got absolutely no results . The stains remained unchanged . Time for the big guns.I got out my Bissell Pro Steamer , used this Extreme Carpet Shampoo and cleaned the rug twice . Lots and lots of suds ... .way too many suds for me but I kept going . Even left the product on the rug to work on those stains before I shampooed the carpet the second time . All this was done on a just pressure washed driveway in the shade and temps in the low 70's.Nothing ... ..I mean no change at all ... .The rug is going to the dump and I am going to demand a refund from the company since this product is guaranteed to work . It does n't ! I have pictures to prove it !	-1
First what is pictured is not what I was sent . I do n't want me exposed to this or my pets rolling on the carpet and then the cats ingesting this junk from their fur . RE just the first item in the contents list ; glycol ether EB , I copied this off the chemical manufacturers MSDS sheet where they also said it smells like ether and to use safety goggles when pouring , Skin : Slightly irritating . Repeated or prolonged contact can cause defatting and drying.Eyes : Slightly irritating . Transitory irritation accompanied by redness . Vapors may be irritating.Inhalation : High vapor concentrations may be irritating to respiratory system . Breathing of vapor may cause headaches , irritation of throat and may cause central nervous system depression.Ingestion : Product is low to slightly toxic . May cause gastric distress , diarrhea and vomiting.Oh and then the ingredients just say `` professional strength detergents . '' Wonder what the heck is in there . Its going back .	-1
Does NOT work for gold barb fry . They swam right out through the vents and became lunch . Lost them all . Slots WAY too large for barbs .	-1
I read all the reviews and thought this was the best breeder for my molly . Most of these breeders seem to get lackluster reviews , so I thought I would take a chance on this one.It 's cheap . For what I need , it 's serviceable , but barely . I put it together easily enough until I got to the netting . It 's too small . So the net only goes up to almost touch the top . The pictures on the box have it coming over the top four corners and therefore staying secure . It 's just poorly made.Also the hooks do n't really work for my tank . I have a 55 gallon , the standard kind . But the hooks are n't nearly long enough to hook over the top and have the net submerged . They are n't even long enough to actually hook over the frame on the the top . And then of course I would n't be able to close the lid all the way.So , I took a piece of styrofoam and created a float to hook the hooks on . I had to use a second piece on the front to compensate for the net not going all the way to the top . This effort was less than it would have taken to send it back , since everyone is complaining about all of them.Then I found out that mollies are pregnant for somewhere around a month ( I thought she was really fat , but she 's not anywhere near ready ) so I let her out , and took the breeder out of the tank . When she is ready , I 'm going to try replacing the netting with nylon stocking . Hopefully that will work.If you really need something and you are willing to get cheap and shoddy workmanship for a small amount of money , then go ahead . But if you want quality that will last , and work properly , this is not the breeder for you .	-1
I have always used Python syphons , so decided to try one of these for giggles . I 'm not giggling terribly much . While it does work , I 've found that the small hole in the large tube end that goes into the aquarium gets clogged far more than it should from debri . I 'll stick with my Pythons .	-1
I ordered this item so my granddaughter could easily change her smaller aquarium . Even with her mother 's help they found it difficult to get it started and operate properly .	-1
I have a 3 gallon aquarium . I can get this started when it 's full , but ca n't restart after taking a gallon out . I also do n't get good enough suction to pick anything up ( not even my tiny red cherry shrimp poop ) . The best I can do is stir up the mess so that more of it can get sucked up . Also there is not safety guard to keep small fish from getting sucked into the tube and stuck . Also , without a & # 34 ; grate & # 34 ; over the opening it is easy for items to get stuck in the tube .	-1
the fittings are not standard for python or aqueon pumps.so it sits in a bin unused till i get adapters .	-1
Received this today and after reading the precautions on the packaging I WAS SHOCKED ! I gave it the benefit of a doubt since a lot of times the warning label on an item goes to the extreme to protect the company selling the item . I was thinking probably one idiot lost a finger when grabbing the cord and retracting the cord ... ANYWAY ... I took it out of the box ( MISTAKE ) then walked my dog halfway down the street . WHOA , I 'm am extremely uncomfortable with this leash . Not only is it heavy & bulky , when I tried to retract the cord back inside the handle it came in SO DANG FAST that my dog got SMACKED in the side of the head so hard she whimpered . I 'm terrified I might burn my child 's legs as she walks along with us or God forbid , have someone lose a finger if they grab onto the cord by mistake . Yes , this thing is that strong . The info . on Amazon.com should clearly state the precautions & warnings as the box and THICK detailed instructions do . Since I 've already made the mistake of trying it out I guess I am stuck with this piece of crap and out $ 20 plus bucks . I will be buying a belt style leash to replace this dangerous one .	-1
I have seen other people use these kinds of leashes around town and in my own neighborhood . I ordered it , thinking it would give my dog more freedom to run a bit while we were on walks . When I received the item , I read the instructions and warnings on the package prior to opening it . The warnings talked about severed limbs , strangulation , and other bad things.Then I got to thinking that if we were on a street corner , and if I did n't have the leash in & # 34 ; lock & # 34 ; mode , and if my dog decided to run for something just as a car went by , then he could be run down by a car while on a leash ! No thanks . I do n't want to have to think about severed limbs , strangulation , or & # 34 ; do I have the leash locked at the proper times & # 34 ; . I just want to walk my dog in peace . And he just wants to have fun , smelling stuff and peeing on stuff . So , I returned the item to Amazon unopened . Amazon was the seller . Thankfully , Amazon is really good about returns .	-1
My puggle , who weighs all of 15 pounds , took off today and the flexi took off after him . my puggle has been with me less than four months and i got this due to the reviews . it stopped retracting about two months ago , and totally broke today . it will not retract and just dangles , tangling him all up . i 'm a very unhappy camper with a dog who needs to go out , badly : (	-1
Having used a large , Xtra long ( 26 foot ) corded Flexi Brand leash for my Lab for 9 years , it finally began to 'catch , ' so I decided to buy a new Flexi Leash in the same size , for the same dog . I found out the corded leash is no longer available in the large size , and the new model has a tape leash instead . I purchased the ( expensive ) new leash , only to find it to be in no way comparable to the 9-year old one in quality or performance.Cons:1 ) The tape twists round and round constantly while the dog is walking , and ends up retracting all twisted up . After taking it off the dog , I have to pull the entire leash out and lock it , and then untwist it while slowy retracting it . I currently have 3 fingers cut almost to the bone from the tape . My dog ran after a squirrel and around a tree . The leash twisted all up , and while trying to unwind my dog from around the tree she tried to run again . I had my hand on the tape ( I had placed it there while trying to unwind the dog from the tree while she was *not* moving ) , and since the tape had twisted all up as it always does , when she ran the other way the tape retracted and twisted more at the same time , slicing three of my fingers . This never happened with the corded leash.2 ) The new leash is already `` catching '' when extended out beyond 10 feet . The old leash did not do this until it was 9 years old.3 ) The `` cap '' covering the seams near the handle came off the first day of use.4 ) The lock button on the new leash is difficult to use with one hand , while on the old leash it was very easy.Pros : I have found no pros with this leash and feel I wasted my money . Even with the `` catching '' , the old leash works better . Save your money and buy another leash .	-1
Amazon reviewers - you have misled me again ! ! I bought this for a 16lb pup , based on the ( for the most part ) glowing reviews . This item is entirely useless and even dangerous , not to mention way more expensive than traditional leashes.1 . The line is not at all durable , and puppy chewed it up in the first 5 minutes . Although he is quite a gentle chewer and responds to `` leave it '' , this has already caused the line to fray and makes me nervous about using this ever again . I see people in the dog park with retractable leashes that are actually substantial leashes , not a thin line , and if you must get a retractable leash , get one of those2 . The thin line retracts in a way that poses a safety risk - as noted in the safety information pamphlet that accompanies this product . I got mild rope burns on my legs despite being fairly careful . I would n't advise using this unless your dog is extremely good at heeling and does n't get tangled up with other dogs in social settings.3 . Complicated to use with the safety attachment , and the clicky mechanism that gets stuck . Ugh . My excellent local pet boutique refuses to stock retractable leashes due to concerns with safety . I wish I had just have listened to them.We have now abandoned retractable leashes , and are very happy customers of a Lupine 6 '' leash for regular walking , and a generic 20 '' cotton one for park training . Sometimes simple is best , and also much cheaper , so I can now afford a Freedom no pull harness . Puppy and I have never looked back .	-1
This skimmer does n't really work well . The suction cups never stay on the tank and it does n't seem to produce the correct amount of bubbles . I ended up needing two air pumps to operate it and it still was n't working efficiently .	-1
I bought this because it had all 5 star rating ( all three ) . I do not know who these people were but for $ 33 I got a plastic toy with no motor . This does not include a motor . Its just a platic tube with a cup on top with an air tube . That 's it . No instuctions either . It does n't have anything to adjust the air or bubbles . And one of the reviewers wrote that this is better than a Coralife . No way . I paid the Shipping fee to return this useless and over priced toy . If you bought this and really liked it please tell me what kind of pump you attached it to and how much the pump cost .	-1
When I was in middle school , I was an avid tropical fish fan . I raised and bred all sorts of fish from easy to take care of goldfish to more challenging angel fish . That was years ago , but my fascination for tropicals has never really left me . I wanted to start up a small tank with a few fish , just for the fun of it , but without much of the hassle . I saw the Eclipse System package and tried one out . Here are my impressions of the kit.The whole system is a complete package that contains all the necessary equipment that you 'll need to get you started in keeping tropicals as pets . The kit includes the actual tank ( which is plexiglass ) , the pump , filter , hood and light . The gravel and other accessories , you provide . Marineland boasts that the biofilter is able to eliminate much of the toxic buildup that occurs when you keep fish , thus providing a carefree , minimal amount of maintainence . Is it true ? Yes and no.Regardless of which filtration system you use , it takes about a month or more before beneficial bacterial builds up in the tank . These little critters are what is behind keeping the fish wastes under control . I found that the Eclipse system can do this , but only if you are very careful in keeping only a few fish in the tank . ( Do n't believe the photo on the box which seems to have 15-20 fish in the tank . In real life , they all would be dead if they were crowded this way . ) Added to this , the condition of your tank water is very , very volatile because the tank is so small . Overfeed your fish , or having a fish that is dead and hidden will reek havoc on your tank and most likely kill or make all your fish ill . The magnetic impeller motor can overheat and burn out easily if your water level becomes too low . The water moving through the motor also serves as a medium to cool it down . But what this means is your tank water will tend to heat up . During the summer months , this will be a very hard thing to control . The filter uses pre-assembled filter packs that are rather expensive and not very effective in trapping particles and debris.The tank is made out of acrylic plastic , so the tank is very easy to scratch and mar . My tank had a hairline crack at the bottom and continued to grow bigger throughout the use of the tank . My fish , while alive , do not seem as healthy as they could be if they were in a larger tank . Although the Eclipse System is convenient , at least for the first few months of operation , the water quality , health of fish , and fragile tank material all outweigh it 's positives . If algae starts to take hold of your aquarium , the algae is extremely hard to remove from the sides of the tank , if not impossible.If you are truly interested in keeping fish as a hobby , it would be much better to spend it on a conventional glass tank with the filter of your choice . Retailers such as PetSmart sell 10 gallon kits that include everything you need to start an aquarium at a much more reasonable price . Marineland sells a larger version of the Eclipse , which is a twelve gallon model , but considering the price of the kit , it is way overpriced for what you could spend for a comparable standard setup . For my money , I will stick to the standard tank setup . Yes , initially , it is a little more hassle to setup , but in the long run , it will be the better choice in keeping you and your fish happy .	-1
I am not impressed with this product . It scratches very easily and I am even extra careful with it.THe light button broke in less than one year and the company can not even get back to me about the warranty.Two stars because I like the design but it just is not executed very well . It is also hard to put the food in the littleslot . Changing water is also a chore because you have to take the whole lid off and it drips water ( condensation ) whendoing so . Just messy and shoddy quality from a company that has zero customer service .	-1
First of all this was not sold by Amazon but a vendor via Amazon . I tried to cancel the order a short time after I placed my order because I did not notice it is acrylic not glass . The vendor refused my request to cancel the order . I did n't want to be rude and refuse to accept delivery . I left it sit in the original packaging for months as I was not happy I bought it . Iot did not come shipped in a sturdy box but in a cardboard wrap ! ( I already had 16 aquariums of various sizes in use . I bought a fish that had to be in his own space so I set it up only to find the filter did not work and has never worked since I set it up . I ended up using a large sponge filter ( Como Biochemical Sponge Filter for Aquarium Fish Tank , by Como ) and covered the large opening in the back of the cover with mesh . The cat stepped on the top and fell in because a large unattached door comes off very easily and falls into the aquarium when you are opening it .	-1
I am disgusted with this litter . After disliking other natural litters I decided to try one more . I 'm assuming I bought Unscented ( not sure , but it was the only variety at my small-town store ) .I agree with another reviewer . The pellets dissolve when peed on and since it 's unscented , smell like pee . And , of course , the poo does n't get covered by pellets ( for whatever reason my cat wo n't dig in pellets to bury it ... ) so my bathroom ends up smelling like cat piss and poo . Actually , no , it ends up smelling like that but ENHANCED . And this is using a litter box with a front flap and air filter on the lid . Not even air freshener around the area helps . After a few days the box smells so bad I have to throw what SHOULD be a week 's worth of pellets away.I was so fed up that I decided to go back to clay clump litter permanently . I also mixed clay litter in with the last of the pellets , even though I should have just thrown them out.Worthless .	-1
This product arrived missing two essential pieces ( the elbow piece that sits on top ) , there is a note inside the packaging asking customers to call if they have a problem , and it says `` DO NOT '' return it , because they will do their best to solve the issue themselves . Well , I have called the Customer Service number , during their so called `` hours of operation '' for three days , and have yet had my call answered , they say leave a voice mail but then the machine says `` I 'm sorry I ca n't do that '' and then it sends you back to the directory and then the whole vicious cycle begins anew . UGH ! ! I did manage to get a hold a confused operator , who answered the phone `` Hello ? ? '' ( like she was n't sure why she picked up the phone ... weird ) She gave me a number in New York , which of course asked me to leave a voice mail , no one returned my call.I did n't want to return because I already chipped out the perforated plastic sections for water to flow through and have it set in the tank ... that 's when I realized it 's missing the pieces.I will be returning it , this has been very frustrating and based on their Customer Service or lack of , I will never buy anything from Penn Plax again .	-1
These treats made my dogs and my mother 's dog throw up foam and bile . One dog , maybe it was going to happen anyway but three ? Definitely the treats . I also think it cracked one of my dog 's teeth . These are terrible treats and I honestly do n't know if I got a bad batch or what based on all of the positive reviews but I 'm very disappointed . I was trying to save a little money buying these but I 'll stick with the regular C.E.T treats and Zukes . Needles to say I 'll be paying for it in Vet bills .	-1
I can not recommend this at all . It is not a good cage cover . It is transparent . A bed sheet offers better light blocking . The description does not disclose this .	-1
I am not crazy about the smell . It does not smell like baby powder . I like that it will not hurt their eyes if it gets in there but other than that I am not impressed with it . It does leave their fur soft though .	-1
my baby lab starts itching all over when I used this . Would not recommend this product . if you must buy it , first test on a leg or something for irritation .	-1
I bought this for my cat because he so loves chin chuckings and pettings all the time . He 's about six years old and is a garden variety orange tabby , neutered . For the life of me , I ca n't get him interested in this item . I 've rubbed him against it , both head and body , and even put treats on it , and he simply could n't care less about it . Also , mine came broken , and my husband had to repair it before putting it on the wall . It was fairly difficult to get it to stay securely . If anyone has any suggestions regarding getting Matt interested in this thing , I 'd appreciate it.September 12 , 2011 update : Matt still wo n't go near this thing . I shove him up next to it once in a while , but he 's totally not interested .	-1
I have four cats ; one of them is CONSTANTLY rubbing his cheeks against EVERYTHING - so I mainly purchased this item for him . I placed the Korner Komber in an area the cats frequently walk through , at a height that would be the most comfortable for them - they NEVER , ever use it ! I even put some catnip in it - still nothing - even though they love catnip . I 'm so surprised they do n't like this . I should have returned it , but I was hoping they would eventually come around to using it . Well , I 've had it for almost 2 1/2 years now and it still gets no use . I 'm glad other people 's cats like it .	-1
We really wanted to like this product . One of our cats loves to have his face rubbed and we thought this would be a favorite for him . Several issues:1 . Without catnip , he was n't interested in it at all.2 . With catnip , all he cared about was getting at the catnip , and not using the comb.and , most importantly:3 . It wo n't stay on the wall . The little sticky tape included is a joke -- it took the cats all of 15 seconds to knock it down . We may try to get other tape to make it stay up , but pricing the good ones ( Command , etc . ) out , it may cost an additional $ 5 for a $ 8 toy . It 's a bit of a rip-off to even sell it this way.This was a disappointment to us and our kitties .	-1
These came today and tonight I mounted it to replace the old one , within 2 minutes it was off the wall . I should have listened to the previous reviews regarding the staying power , these cat scratch combs do not have it . I tried some special double sided adhesive tape the body shops use to keep emblems etc . on cars and it will not hold it on the wall either . It has to be the way it is made , the back side is not smooth , it has edges , so whatever is used will not adhere to any wall . I will try to order the kind I had , which is Mr. Spatts Cat a Comb . It lasted for years , finally almost all the teeth came off .	-1
It only works for dry tanks and i wish I would have known that before I ordered it . The one thing that I did like was that I called customer service and they told me everything that I need to know .	-1
This was a complete waste of money . We put it on a 10 gallon tank , followed all directions to the letter , and now wish there were a way to get our money back ! I can feel SLIGHT warmth if I put my hand directly against the glass on top of it and focus really hard ( and if the room is kept at least 80 degrees ) . It definitely should not be labeled a `` heater '' . It seems to do nothing at all if I turn off the heater in the room and let the temp go below 75 in there.HOW does this thing have such a good rating ? ? ? And why is there nothing in the description that says it 's only supposed to be used under dry tanks ? I have a couple of inches of water for my turtles , and it was n't until this thing was bought , paid for and delivered that I saw that in the directions . It should be stated up front so those of us with aquatic reptiles do n't waste our money !	-1
I have this on the bottom of my 10 gallon tank for my leo . I attempted to use it with out the heat lamp but there was not enough heat ( this is surprising living in San Diego ) . I then turned both the heating pad and heating lamp on and it got way too hot . The heating lamp itself provides enough heat but I thought my leo would appreciate more belly heat . Unfortunate that it was n't working out for me .	-1
Bought this for my sons corn snake . It is too hot to put it on the bottom of the tank . Was going to send it back and ran out of time . Now we just use it on the side . Will buy something different before winter with a thermometer that can be set on a temp . And manage itself .	-1
This is the third clamp lamp I 've purchased , but the only one from Zoo Med . The ceramic ring came loose after I tried to screw a bulb in . I will have to return it . I will probably have to purchase another fluker 's clamp lamp .	-1
I was getting a light flicker , or issues with it just not turning on , and when i opened it up , I noticed that the wire was exposed from rubbing on the inlet hole . I opened the second one to find the same thing.. dangerous ... I was able to cut and rewire them and no problems since.. I tossed one out in favor of a larger clip lamp from lowes which i would recommend over these due to the better quality , longer plug , higher wattage , and lower price .	-1
I purchased three of these regulators for my larger terrariums , and all three failed within two years , just out of warranty.These would be beneficial if A ) They had an appropriate lifespan , and B ) If they were made such that you could choose a temperature range for the default setting . When choosing your preferred temperature , one has to guess how hot to set it and modify with time . If it were able to show a range ( 70 - 75 degrees , etc . ) as opposed to the cool-to-warm color gradient on the dial , I think it would be much more useful . All three failed within two years , and I sha n't be replacing them .	-1
I had a 10-gallon tank with some beautiful mollies . I just had to house them for one day before they could be added to a 55-gallon tank . This heater could n't even handle the task for one day . Overnight , it unexpectedly overheated and fried my fish . Do n't be cheap : if you care about your fish , invest in a decent submersible heater with a reliable thermostat . When it comes to aquarium heaters , you really do get what you pay for . Unfortunately , I had to learn this the hard way .	-1
I borrowed some of the info in this review from another Amazon.com customer review on the smaller heater . From what I can see and from what I have read the heaters from this company and it 's `` Elite Radiant '' product line appear to be quite similar . *Unfortunately it 's not submersible . ( I did n't realize not buying submersible would mean needing to reach a water line indicator . ) *It requires the tank to be full to cover the water line indicator ( Not good if you are breeding snails ( or certain fish ) because snails to lay their eggs on the tank 's glass , and could escape easily ) . *The water line indicator also rises above my power filter , so I 'll never be able to get the water to the height it 's asking . *The power cord is much shorter than I thought it would be . I had to get an extension cord to plug it in . The picture on the back of the packaging suggests to make a drip loop , but the cord is barely long enough to do that , and the top of the aquarium is only a couple feet , give or take , from the socket . Very inconvenient . *Temperature control knob seems really sensitive , and even turning the knob a quarter of an inch seems to cause the temperature to shoot up . But as soon as the desired temperature is attained , it will maintain.I ca n't use this thing . Waste of money , waste of time . I 'm going to buy a better product . Maybe the Fluval which got pretty good/consistent reviews . That said , it does heat the aquarium but the thermostat will not work unless the water is filled to the indicator line which is nearly impossible because you have to overfill your aquarium in order to meet the requirements of this heater . I think a submersible heater would be better for most people 's needs .	-1
I could n't figure out what to do with it and broke it in under 2 minutes .	-1
Like the air bubbles , but very challenging to adjust the weights to place the diffuser when the tank is already filled .	-1
simply put this product does not work , the power out of the battery is insufficient to suck in almost anything . I tried it on plant trimmings , no luck . Then I tried it on gravel it only caused a mess without sucking in anything .	-1
A manual vacuum could clean a tank better than this product . Not worth the price . I would not recommend it .	-1
I loved this at first , but it quickly broke . The plastic is too brittle and it snapped at the joint where the large tubing connects . Does a great job when it is operational !	-1
Item was useless . Does not do the job it claims.Every use requires a new set of batterys .	-1
This thing is always falling down to the bottom of the tank and I have to reach in and get it . I 've had others that you could retrieve with the magnet , but not this one . I dont like it	-1
It 's a complete waste of money . It does n't clean at all on glass . It barely cleans on my acrylic tank .	-1
We bought this cleaner to help quickly finish off a tank cleaning as well as to occasionally give our Betta tank a swift touch up , but it was actually more work than anything . The product includes a string that is supposed to & # 34 ; shimmy & # 34 ; the pads to clean the tank walls , but it 's nearly impossible to do this with ease or speed . In addition , the pads were not of very good quality either only adding to the frustration .	-1
I had high hopes for this gravel vac ... however , it fails miserably.I have a 55 gallon aquarium , and this vac does not generate nearly enough suction to adequately clean it . There is n't even enough suction to lift the feces from the gravel to the top of the wand.My water changes now take twice as long due to the low flow of the vac , and the gravel remains full of stool.This will be going into the trashcan where it belongs .	-1
I should have listened to the other reviews complaining about the lack of power.What it really boils down to ( IMO ) is that the valve is poorly designed . It relies on the grate to be perfectly tight in order to prevent backflow . Got ta check that grate before every water change ! ! Even when the valve is working , it is very difficult to start via any of the three common methods.Another major flaw is the lack of an angle at the input end . I find there is no effective suction until the entire oval is pressed against the gravel surface , which is difficult when there is no angle.Lastly , the large diameter hose pulls water way too quickly . The combination of no angle with large hose turns this is a rapid siphon . This leaves me rushing to clean what I can before the bucket is full.Perhaps I got spoiled with my old Fluval vac , but its smaller hose gave me plenty of time to dig around and loosen detris . Too bad they do n't make a longer one . My hunt for a good 24 '' gravel vac continues .	-1
This product is hard to get going . You have to shake up and down really hard and if you have a smaller tank there may not be enough room to do so . The 2nd time I went to use it the suction would n't work at all . I shook up and down like a crazy person while shouting obscenities . I even had my husband try and he could n't get it to work either . I returned it and got my money back .	-1
bought this to clean out my 10 gallon fish tank . once i got it to start sucking out the water it would stop and would have to take it apart to dig rocks out of the little flap at the top .	-1
I had this for about 10 minutes when it accidentally slipped from my hand as I was sitting down . It landed on gravel and shattered into 100 's of shards . After a curse or two I cleaned it up and went to Walmart . When I went there I found the exact same thing for about $ 1.65 ! So I bought it but I was n't pleased with the mark-up I had seen here and that on top of shipping . Do n't always assume you get a better deal at Amazon is all I 'm saying .	-1
The thermometer is made of very thin glass , and a bubble mailer is n't sufficient packaging for such a product . Nevertheless , that 's what it arrived in . The thermometer was completely shattered , beyond use or repair . I 'm returning it and purchasing theFluval Nano Thermometerbecause it 's much thicker glass and I 've never had a problem with those in the three that I 've bought .	-1
numbers to small , ended up buying one @ the pet store.Very nice design but its hard to see the numbers.Gave it away .	-1
The suction cup works well to hold the thermometer to the side , but the numbers are so small they are hard to read . It is also hard to see the red mercury line because it is extremely thin.Bought 3 of these glass thermometers . One of these broke simply from laying it on the counter . Then after a few months noticed the bottom was broke on the other thermometers in the aquarium ! There were small peices of broken glass and beads on the bottom of the tank , and the hanging thermometers had jagged edges.Really am not sure how they broke . The fish like to bump them when searching for food or just swimming around and the bottom of the thermometer hits the aquarium . The big Pleco sucks algae of the glass , mabe he bumped it . Did my best to vacume up the broken glass & black beads . Made me half sick thinking about the fish swallowing some or getting cut on the jagged thermometer glass. Can not recommend these . From now on we will be using the digital kind . They may be more expensive but worth it to me .	-1
Title says it all.I bought two of these . To compare I put them side by side ( with slight spacing ) in my 45 gallon aquarium . These little babies were telling me that I had a 4 degree difference withing an inch of space.Do you fish/invertebrates a favor , buy another thermometer .	-1
The thermometer works but the suction cup left a cloudy mark on my acrylic aquarium . Nothing I 've tried has removed it . Sadly I put it right in front while I was getting the tank right for the fish .	-1
I bought it on sale from amazon . First off , the temp reading seemed stuck at 82F . Then while adjusting within the tank the tip lightly bumped against the wall and broke . I am not sure if I got all the pieces out . Not a good purchase .	-1
I bought this for my new tank , which I have 2 heaters for ( rated for 75 gallons and I have a 56 gallon tank ) . The thermometer was reading a full 10 degrees below what my heaters were set at . I could not for the life of me figure out why my heaters were both malfunctioning , so just to rule out having to replace more expensive heaters I bought another thermometer at a local store . Within 15 minutes it matched the temperature of my heaters within 1 degree . I was presented now with an issue of 2 opposing thermometers and no solid answer . So I bought another thermometer at the local store . This thermometer also read within 1 degree of the temperature set on my heaters.I have never sent an item back to Amazon before for a refund until I this thermometer . It was not just a little off , it was a complete 10 degrees off . There was not any obvious damage from shipping . It was actually packaged extremely extremely well . It was individually wrapped in layers and layers of bubble wrap and then surrounded by air bubbles along with other items in the box .	-1
Pretty flimsy , I got a couple of them and those both cracked and probably leaked inside my 55 gallon tank .	-1
this is a very small net and I was expecting a much larger size . the net can only be used for getting debris out of the tank or for very slow fish .	-1
It does its job . However , my Aquaclear 70 filter came with a set of filter media , including this sponge . And since you can use something else , such as poly-fil straight from a craft isle , which is much cheaper ( and quite possibly better ) , and/or you can simply gently rinse the foam in tank water during a water change to clear off solid gunk ( in fact you want to ; rinsing thoroughly gets rid of beneficial bacteria necessary for a healthy tank , and rinsing in tap water will kill the bacteria outright - trace chlorine is still deadly ) On the other hand , I did find it useful to cut off a chunk , make a slit , and cover my filter intake to keep any more of my little guys from getting sucked up : ( ... and it 's always probably a good idea to have spares , just in case . So , especially with shipping , i feel like i spent way more than i should have , but the product itself does what it 's supposed to do , and then some . Then again , so does a coat hanger .	-1
I thought this would help to reduce ammonia , it was suggested for over stocked tanks . One of my tanks had an unexpected ammonia spike so I tried all 3 bags . After testing levels daily there has been no decrease in ammonia whatsoever . Wish it worked but it did n't . I got the ammonia down by switching a couple of trays from the canister in my other big tank . Now both are cycled again .	-1
doesnt work very well at all , you are much better off with an astablished bacteria setup , spend your money on bio rings and let your tank setup .	-1
need larger bags , and ones specifically for the fluval FX5 baskets . if you have a few fish in a large tank they will be fine , but a fully stocked predator tank these just dont hold up for more than a week or two .	-1
I got this for my cat because she has skin allergies and had one specific area where she was picking . I could not get this to work for her because it smelled so bad and she licked it right off . It might work for dogs but I would n't recommend a spray like this for cats .	-1
I have been using this on my six month old golden retriever for about two weeks , spraying him every other day or so and rubbing it in . He loves it , immediately relaxes ( this dog hardly EVER relaxes ! ) .He is suffering from flea allergy I think - my vet tells me a dog can be itchy long after the fleas are gone ( he definitely had fleas and flea bites but that was months ago ) . He has no fleas now but is still feeling itchy all over his body , legs , tail , whole body really - and , while he has no hot spots , I do n't want to see them start either . And it is not fun watching your dog suffer . When I spray him , he immediately stops scratching and obviously looks relieved . So , no doubt in my mind that it works.After reading up on the toxicity concern , all the sources I checked said it is toxic to cats - and small dogs are more of a concern and overuse is not good and the dog injesting it by licking can be a concern too.I do think the company needs to do better labeling - what is the concentration of the tea tree oil and what do they have to say about it 's use and toxicity ? If the concentration is very low , I will feel better . So , I am going to call them and ask.My own experience , though , on this 60 pound dog , is it does work and I have not seen any negative symptoms - but I will not depend on it as an every day treatment either . And , if he starts licking it , I will not use it anymore . Ingestion seems to be a more toxic pathway than simply administered on the skin.This is a follow up . I called the company in TX and asked the woman who answered if the company realized that tea tree oil is toxic to dogs and cats at some concentrations . She replied that they knew that . I told her that their product is getting hammered on Amazon and it might be helpful to know the concentration - maybe it is so low as to not be much of an issue . She became quite curt when I asked what the concentration of TTO was that they used in their product , telling me that information was propietary so she could not tell me ! I guess their philosophy is `` just trust me '' .Do n't think I will buy this product anymore . I have dropped my rating from 4 to 2 stars.Hope this helps	-1
I love that this is a natural remedy , but unfortunately my dog thought it tasted great too . I ended up having to take her to the vet to take care of her 'hot spot ' issue .	-1
For the safety of your dog DO NOT USE this product ! Tea tree oil is highly toxic for dogs ! My dog had a reaction after just a few hours and I had to take her into an ER vet in the middle of the night . I have tried to contact the company to find out why they are still selling a product that is toxic to dogs but they have not responded . Please for the safety of your dog , do not use this product , it is not worth the risk . There are many other hot spot and rash ointments that do not contain tea tree oil . Just google `` tea tree oil for dogs '' to find out more information .	-1
I bought this for my dogs who were having skin allergy issues . I think it burned their skin . My female cried the entire time it was on her until it was washed off .	-1
I have a Chocolate lab with bad allergies so bad that she needs to have a bath once a week to avoid her scratching herself into a frenzy ... ... I have been using another type of shampoo that has been doing well but I thought I would give this a try to see if I can get her to be even more comfortable.Sadly this shampoo was not for my girl , she gradually got worse and worse and not until I switched back to my tried and trusted shampoo and that is why I will stick with what I know.I am not saying that this shampoo is bad it 's just not for my Lab .	-1
not good . my vet says the tea tree oil will make his skin shed , and that 's what it did . no help whatsoever.My rottie has constant yeast and skin allergies , this product did nothing but escalate the issue . Im sure every case is different , but I will not use this product for my dog .	-1
I do not know the washer is working or not , but the dryer I hate it ! It is sticky and become white powder stay on her ear it is hard to clean it off	-1
I was disappointed because I thought after all the good reviews this would be the product that finally worked for us . My dog has been suffering from chronic yeasty ears for 2 years and the vet 's prescription meds are no longer working . The actual wash burned his ears he would yelp when I put it in . After a couple times he would no longer let me put it in his ears . I then tried Zymox without hydrocortisone which has since cleared them up perfectly . I may try the wash again now that his ears are cleared up , but I 'm a little reluctant .	-1
These items were ok . I used it for a while but my dog started to have allergic reactions to it so had to stop using . Our chihuahua is very senstive though .	-1
this stuff is worthless , it is basicly fine carbon and some resins stuffes in a fine mess bag , problem is the media bag its in is so fine and the contests fo fine , its hard to get water to flow thru it and quickly clogges up . I have gotten better results using a high quality pellet carbon . Dont waste your money on this crap	-1
I bought this hoping to replace the 10W florescent that my tank came with . These lights are EXTREMELY yellow , and do n't look good at all compared to a florescent . I would absolutely go with the 10W florescent every time over this light . It 's a good price , but not the product I was hoping for .	-1
It is alfalfa based , which is supposed to be ok for baby piggies , up until 6 mos old , but it has too much calcium in it , and I was finding powdery white spots from where his urine dried in the crate . Too much calcium can cause bladder stones , and that is not a good thing . My vet said to stop feeding it to him , so I switched him to Oxbow , and the problem stopped .	-1
my guinea pig will not eat it and she poped in it . i think it only has that effect with her .	-1
I only say what my Guinea pigs tell me and they say this is crap ! I think they would choose death from starvation before eating this . I 'm waiting for a special order of their favorite pellets from amazon and I thought this would hold them until it came in . This is pale in color and must taste bad as they will not touch it . If your pigs are fat and too healthy buy this to remedy that . If you want a great product order *** Oxbow Cavy cuisine**** ... Firm pellets , dark green and your pets will love them . Unfortunately Oxbow is expensive . I found a 10lb . bag here on Amazon for the same price as the 5lb . bag also found here on Amazon but the delivery is way long and they may just cancel the order as they have with another awesome deal I had with them . I will be pissed if they do .	-1
Cat does n't feel irritated with this , and the fur smells well after application for another 2-3 days . That is the only positive feedback I could contribute to that . My cat is very fluffy , and I was so much in hope for this shampoo to provide cleaning without any negative impact on cat 's fur . But after application and complete drying , my cat 's fur decreases in its volume , though the fur feels very soft by touch . Maybe this will have better effect on short-haired cats .	-1
I will not be recommending this product to anyone to buy in the winter . I received 3 of these along with other pet supplies earlier in the week , one was completely empty , 2 were less than 1/2 full.sent the empty one back and received a new one today . It is not even 1/2 full and totally frozen . Very disappointed with this . Am not going to return it again , but will not buy during the cold months .	-1
I like the idea of using the foam ( this is more liquid with bubbles than a foam ) so that the cat is n't saturated . It leaves the cat with a light pleasant smell . I am very disappointed that I only got two full uses out of this . I have a tiny bit left in the bottle but it is n't enough to do another full body rub down.I read another review where someone got 2 washes per bottle but I thought maybe that person just had a fat cat that required more foam . I could n't believe that the company would sell a bottle with only 2 washes worth of foam . However , I was wrong . My cat is about 8 months old and between 7-8 pounds so she is n't a fat cat and the bottle only worked for two uses.If you do n't mind paying $ 3.25 per foam bath this is a great product .	-1
My rabbit was n't particularly impressed with this food , and it caused her to produce three times the amount of droppings than she normally does . I can only conclude that there is a lot of indigestible junk in this food . I will not be buying this again .	-1
Great price , but do n't be fooled . If you need real flea control , you 've got to shell out the bucks for Advantage or Frontline . We have a 14 year-old American Eskimo with a very thick coat . Advantage and Frontline do work for her , but I been much happier with our latest scheme : we wash her and her bedding once a week , religiously . Granted , we do use a flea shampoo and she does n't go outside without a leash , so there 's no real time for her to wade through waist-high weeds and roll in dead stuff like she 'd love to . She 's outside for one to two hours a day . But I 'm telling you , washing her once a week and using a `` rake '' style comb ( try the `` Furminator '' ) to tame her undercoat have meant that we do n't use ANY flea medicine on her . Previously , I was vacuuming all the time , spraying the carpets , upholstery and floor boards . . .I hated using that many chemicals in the house ! Finally , you do n't want this Hartz stuff because it lasts about one week , leaves an oily residue on the dog , and smells like you 've dipped your canine friend in gallons of baby powder . Nasty stuff .	-1
I tried this product first as it was cheaper than Frontline.I was very disappointed as it left my poor pets constantly scratching.It does n't do what it claims , and I 'd never use it again.Sorry	-1
If only I had seen these reviews prior to making this purchase . This product did not kill my dog 's fleas and nearly killed my cat who consumed it from the dog . The word `` terrible '' is cringing for having to be associated with this product .	-1
as a petcare professional , i strongly urge no one to buy any type of OTC ( over the counter ) version of flea & tick control . as stated in the first review , it can kill or make your pet seriously ill. my Russian Blue almost died a few years ago when i stupidly tried to save money & i KNEW better ! 300 bucks later & a few bags of IV fluids , my Jake started to recover but he may have residual kidney damage.IS YOUR PET 'S LIFE WORTH SAVING A FEW BUCKS ? ? not mine.even if its worked well in the past , w/ new formulas & products , you are putting your pets ' life in danger w/ every product such as this you put on them . besides , they do n't work as well , last as long or kill a variety of stages like the rx . so you really are n't saving money in the long run.hope this helps.pwps ... .at least Hartz pd my vet bill !	-1
This is a stylish well made container for a betta fish.Pluses : + High quality finish , no rough or unfinished edges . The included vinyl background is double-sided and appears to be waterproof ( or at least water resistant ) + Available in several colors to suit your tastes.+ Kit arrives with water conditioner and flake food for the novice Betta keeper.+ even includes small diameter gravel , which is preferred for beneficial bacteria and the like.Minuses : - WATER TEMPERATURES are subject to ambient temp of the room . Bettas are tropical fish so unless your room is heated at 68-75 degrees , the water in this tank will likely fall below that range which will stress the Betta.- NO LIGHT included . At nearly $ 15 , it would have been nice to include a halogen bulb light . The Marine LED light accessory ( sold separately ) costs more than the tank itself AND does NOT include an ON/OFF switch.- GRAVEL displacement ; It would be neat if the gravel stayed neatly packed in the rectangular basket on the tank bottom . However it is far to easy for the stones to fall out of the perimeter and nearly impossible to fetch any of the gravel once displaced due to the size of the tank and gravel itself which inherently defeats the clean `` Zen '' look . Great concept but hard to implement.Seems like people are confusing ethics and lack of fish keeping experience with this product . I have kept Bettas in my office with ( daily - bi weekly water changes depending on the container size ) for years . The main problem with this kit is the difficulty in maintaining a temperature within range that is comfortable for a Betta fish . There are 7.5 watt heaters available that lack an adjustable thermostat that recommends that the temperatures be monitored . So if this is marketed as a Betta `` KIT '' , it just falls short as a heater is needed . If this was sold strictly as a stylish container , then i would give it 5 stars.Just for reference , i originally purchased two of these as gifts for the kids , and days later , ordered two Aqueon Evolve 4 gallon tanks to replace them . If one chooses to be a fish keeper , do it the right way , or skip the hobby all together ...	-1
I really wish people would really educate themselves about betta splendens and their housing requirements . These so-called 'betta kits ' are not acceptable by any serious aquarist . This tank is clearly too small . A betta fish needs a larger tank that is big enough for a heater to fit inside it . Bettas are tropical fish and they do need a heater to regulate their body temperature and keep them healthy ( room temperature water will not help keep a fish heal its fins if it has fin rot or shredded its fins for some other reason ) . Secondly bettas are intelligent , curious creatures who likes to swim around and through things . This tank does not provide the space for that kind of activiity . With this little prison , er , tank , the fish is just going to sit there and eventually bite its tail due to boredom . If you want to get a betta fish , at least get a medium Kritter Keeper , a mini hyor heater , and a few silk plants and nice bridge for the fish . I would n't even use this fish prison for water changes or as a hospital .	-1
This item is obviously aimed at children , and is appealing in that respect . It is n't as simple and easy to use as one might expect however , and is also pretty expensive for what you are getting.It 's a little awkward and clumsey to fit into the base while keeping the backround in place . The backround should be plastic rather than coated paper.The little square for gravel is cute , but difficult to actually use . Getting and keeping the gravel confined to it is an almost comical process and of course has to be repeated with every cleaning . The gravel is smaller grain than typical aquarium gravel.The top is just a frame like cover with an overly large opening in the middle . Plenty large enough for jumpers to end it all , I would set something over it.The kit includes a small packet of food and upon opening it smelled fresh . It 's a flake food , most feed bettas pellets.There 's a small bottle of water treatment/conditioner that contains a declorinator and Indian Almond Leaf extract.The tiny size makes frequent water changes necessary . I would n't expect to do less than at least 50 % every other day or 100 % a couple times a week.As stated in the description it holds almost exactly one half gallon of water with the substrate in place.Is this a good permanent home for a Betta ? No , it would be much like just keeping it in the cup you brought it home in.Can you keep a Betta in this and have it remain healthy ? Yes , if you are diligent and 100 % faithful to caring for it . It is after all just an empty plastic container . You would need to try to heat it somehow , which can be done but requires extreme care with such a tiny volume of water.Aside from underestimating the water changes required , the instructions are accurate . They stress acclimating , warm 75 to 80 water and no more than 30 seconds worth of food at a time.If you buy this for a child , be prepared to spend time regularly maintaining it , and expect to at some point either upgrade or rehome the fish . The novelty is bound to wear off since the fish has little room to actually do much that would be fun or interesting to watch for long .	-1
I got my very first betta as a gift along with this tank . I 've only used this as a transitional tank for my bettas to live in for the first couple of days to a week until the larger tank has finished cycling through . People have a misconception that Betta fish are not very active fish , but that 's based on when they buy them at the store and they look sort of dead . The reason they do n't move around is because they have been living in those cups their entire life and they 're pretty much comatose . At first they really like this little .5 gallon tank because its so much bigger than their cup and they 'll swim around happily , but they will get bored of it extremely fast . Not to mention this gets dirty FAST , and doing 10 % water changes every 2-3 days is just not enough . I keep a couple of gallons of pretreated water ready for water changes , so I was able to put my 2nd betta in this tank the day I got her . I put the rocks in the first time with my male betta and he liked to rest on the black stones inside . This time around I did n't put anything in there and I found she really likes to hide in the cubby hole . My 6 month old female is small enough she could probably live in there for two weeks and be okay , but the male fish are absolutely WAY too big for this tank.If you need a place to put your fish while you clean out their entire tank , or when you first get them and you want to set up a larger tank but it has to cycle through ... I recommend this one . Just remember water needs to treat for 2-3 days before you can put a fish in the tap water . I was lucky and had some water ready on the second time around . However , if you want a permanent home I would absolutely say do not get this one . If a betta has adequate room they will spend all day swimming around in their tank . They are very intelligent fish too who enjoy making bubbles and interacting with humans . Imagine someone putting you in a small coat closet with nothing in it , with all white walls , nothing to keep yourself entertained , and making you live inside it for months , bringing you food occasionally . That is about what betta fish feel like in these tanks.I recommend the mini bow 2.5 gallon tanks . I have one of them for each of my bettas .	-1
Generally I am a big fan of the KONG brand dog toys . They are usually very durable , especially considering my dogs can chew anything to shreds . This bone did not hold up well at all . It was ruined within a half hour of getting it home . If you have a strong chewer , I would not recommend this bone , stick with the traditional KONG or some of their other stronger toys ( treat ball , etc . ) .	-1
Do n't waste your money ! I have had other Red Kong toys in the past and I thought the Black was supposed to be EXTREME ! Nope . It lasted about 5 minutes . Very disappointed .	-1
My 43 lb collie puppy ate the end off in 3 minutes . Advertised for large to extra large dog , but did n't stand up to my medium puppy . Waste of money .	-1
This did n't make it past the 1st chew session . The normal KONG lasts longer . I put a treat in this at the top and that was ripped right off . Horrible design . Do n't buy .	-1
I bought this version because the red goodie bone was starting to break apart after fairly light use . That one had nice holes on the ends that my small treats , & lt ; 1 '' , fit into perfectly . This one however has much smaller treat holes . I ca n't fit anything in there without using so much force the treat crumbles in my hands . The rubber seems much more durable but I 'll never know since I ca n't get any treats in it . I 'm very disappointed they made the treat holes essential worthless on this model . Obviously it is made only for the treat paste , which is mostly junk food .	-1
Holes in the ends are too big for kibble & too small for even minature dog bones . Kibble falls out immediately ; dog bpones stay stuck for days . My dog just ate the part of the bone sticking out . Also , he does n't like to play with it as a bone .	-1
1x1x1 inches ? What is this , a rubber snack ? Not going to buy it if I ca n't tell what I 'm purchasing . This needs a better description .	-1
Toys usually only last a matter of minutes with my 9 m.o . lab mix , and unfortunately this was no different . Literally one minute after I handed it to him , he had already eaten one of the ends off . : ( We 've had much better luck with our squirrel dude , so far it 's the only treat dispensing toy that he has n't completely destroyed .	-1
My dog ( 40 lbs of chewer ) broke this bone in half in 30 seconds . So much for & # 34 ; extreme chew. & # 34 ; However , we did next buy the large regular Kong goodie bone and he has not been able to destroy that yet ! If your dog destroys toys easily and quickly , just buy the large regular red bone rather than this . It is NOT for extreme chewers !	-1
Most Kong products are superior . However , this item was a great disappointment . The location for placing treats was poorly constructed	-1
Did n't last five minutes . Pretty sad . Was hoping for at least a few months of chew time out of it . Oh well .	-1
My 8 month old Rottie girl had the end chewed off and swallowed in less than 5 minutes . Not for extreme chewers .	-1
Kong makes some great toys for strong chewers , but this item is not one of them . We purchased this for our puppy , who also decimates toys , as the other reviewer 's dog , and the ends where it holds treats got destroyed quickly . I think the rubber housing for the treats is not of a great design . Dogs with sharp teeth can immediately break off the nubs on the inside where the treat would go , and start cracking the rubber on the ends . Not recommended by us ; stick to the original Kong shape .	-1
I generally like Kong Toys because they last but not with this dog . If you have a very strong chewing dog stick to Nylabones . My guy chewed the end off this bone in about 5 minutes . I have taken all the Kong toys away as he is eating them . His poop looks like confetti !	-1
Bought one for each of my German Shepherds . Both beyond chewing stage , these were great toys for them to carry around , play keep away , trade off , and what have you.One of the shepherds passed , and along comes a Foxhound puppy . She quickly destroyed both bones , concentrating on the weak part , just as other reviewers have commented . I would n't even classify her as an aggressive chewer , just her puppy chewing stage , which is still going on even though she now has all her adult teeth , but I digress.So definitely a big NO for aggressive chewers and chewing puppies . You 've stopped buying stuffed toys , may have found some success with Kong , and you want to step it up with Kong Extreme . This bone does NOT belong in the Extreme line . I ca n't fairly give it 1 star as it is a good toy for non-chewers , but for many it is dissappointment waiting to happen . Take it out of the Extreme line and it 's a 3-4 star product . Do not buy for a dog/pup that chews things to bits . Stick with the Extreme Kong or the Extreme Rubber Ball , and buy one size up .	-1
Chewed ends with in couple of weeks . Would like to have replaced with large goodie dog bone to see if would last longer .	-1
Very disappointed in this toy ... our two dogs destroyed it within 5 minutes of having it . We were watching them and they were playing with it when all of a sudden they it in two pieces ... very disappointed .	-1
I would give it 2 stars to be fair - but my 1 star is to balance out all the great reviews - because the simple FACT is that in short order even a year old Aussie mix can start to rip the rubber starting with the holes where you might stuff goodies . So do n't believe the hype.So - like any toy - you got ta watch those doggies !	-1
I have a strong chewer and have had success with a few other black KONG toys . I purchased this with high hopes but within a few minutes it was destroyed . The problem was with the ends of the bone because they are hallow and easily chew-able by the dogs . My dog chewed up the ends immediately and little black rubber pieces were everywhere .	-1
I thought KONG extreme were supposed to be durable ... my power chewer destroyed this bone within a matter of a half hour .	-1
I got this toy for my Rottweiler puppy when she was still pretty small ( in the 15-20 pound range ) . She does like chewing on it fairly well , so I 'll give it points for that . Lately , chewing on this particular toy has been a bit of an obsession for her , which leads me to my first complaint : The holes in the end , where you are supposed to put treats , are easy for my dog to get her teeth inside . Over the course of the last day or two , pieces have started coming off . I am pretty sure they will pass through her system , as the pieces are not terribly large and she is a 70 pound dog at this point . However , if a smaller dog chewed off and swallowed pieces of the same size , that could be an issue.My second issue is that I was never very successful actually getting treats to stay in the holes , so this toy was not much of a challenge for my dog . The KONG brand treats ( here I 'm talking about hard cookie-type treats ) are , if the large type , too big , and if smaller , they tend to break under the amount of force required to fit them in the holes . If there is some special kind of treat that is supposed to go in this toy , it was not at all apparent from the packaging or the store display ( this last one , admittedly , is not the fault of the KONG company ) . I tried using other types of hard dog treats but had to break them into small pieces which did n't stay in the holes very well . I 'm a bit disappointed with this aspect of the toy , because the other KONG toys ( the traditional shape ) will fit pretty much any kind of treat that 's just slightly larger than the opening . That is definitely not the case here.These may be appropriate for older , medium-to-large dogs with less of a tendency to remove pieces of toys . But if you are looking for a treat-holding toy for an active chewer , I 'd go with one of the original KONG toys -- my puppy has two of those and they have held up pretty well .	-1
I knew when my Catahoula X ( 55 lbs ) extreme chewer got a medium Kong for Christmas that it would last long but he did n't chew it up despite two hours of non-stop chewing . When I checked it to see how much damage he was doing I was shocked to see that it had NO chew marks but was almost broken completely thru about 2/3 of the way towards one end . A little longer and he could have broken it off and could have swallowed it ! There was also a & # 34 ; crack & # 34 ; on only one side toward the other end . All I can attribute it to is twisting the end . DO NOT give this toy to a medium or larger dog who is a tough chewer ! This would be fine for a small or medium ( 20-40 # ) normal chewer .	-1
My husky destroyed this toy in exactly 4 minutes literally just chewed it in half . Went in the trash can the same day as when the package arrived : - ) I went with the largest size available : not strong enough for heavy chewers ... The bone bends easily allowing for the rubber to break in the middle.Wo n't purchase this one again .	-1
It was recommended to have a soft slicker/soft pin brush for my english cocker spaniel . Because I plan on doing my cocker 's grooming I wanted to introduce grooming tools in order of what I thought would be the least invasive . I have used this brush on my puppy 's dry coat while she was relaxed on my lap . Gently and lightly stroking through fine un-matted fur , my puppy jumped . After praising her for sitting so that I could try again , she allowed me two strokes and started barking . I have tried multiple times since , but my puppy will not have it . Personally I like the grip on the handle it is very comfortable and easy to use . I have done the pin test on my hands and arms and do not have streaks from it . I am hoping this brush works as my puppy gets older , maybe her skin is too sensitive and soft . For now , I have to use the KONG rubber slicker brush which she loves .	-1
Purchased for my Pomeranian-Chihuahua mix . Does n't work very well on small dogs . I would highly recommend it for larger dogs though . It does it 's intended job . It 's just a really large brush and it 's hard to brush my small dog with it .	-1
I actually poked myself with this by trying to pull the hair out of it and it hurt like hell.I have returned this for a better and safer product .	-1
got it for my lab mix who do n't really have an undercoat much at all and brused him when he was sheding the brush did n't pick up but a few hairs but it is GREAT for massaging his skin to produce natural oils for his coat , his butt hair is a litt dry from chewing	-1
Not a fan . Doesnt really do much . Im a groomer and was hoping it would do what everyone was saying .	-1
My puppy has very fluffy hair with an undercoat . This is a wire brush and pulls his hair out in tufts . Unusable .	-1
i got this comb for my bichon , it does not work at all . it works on my cats ok , but it will not go through my bichons hair at all and he still has fluffy puppy furr	-1
This is the third type of Litter Mat I have bought my cat with the hard rubber or Hard Plastic . She jumps right over it . I bought 2 of the $ 9,99 FANCY GRATE ones with the hard plastic grate . She FLEW over them right out of her Litter Robot rather than step on them . I bought the expensive one that is like PLASTIC/Rubber fake grass and she REALLY HATED that one . That 's out back being used as a door mat ... Rotting in the sun.I put a throw rug down from Walmart and she does n't blink an eye . However I am constantly vacuuming it . What a pain .	-1
It was way smaller than expected and my kittens hated stepping on it so they would jump over it , which defeated the purpose of having it in the first place .	-1
This is too small and my cat would just jump over it rather than subject himself to stepping on hard plastic . A waste of money & too expensive to send back .	-1
I 'm just not convinced these things work at all , and this one does n't increase my optimism . My cats still track litter well beyond the box . I agree with another reviewer , I do n't think cats like stepping on this hard plastic mat . I do n't like stepping on it , so why would they with their tiny feet ? ! I bought it because it was a good size and reasonable price - not so reasonable if it does n't work . I wish I could find a foam one on Amazon to see if it does better . The bathroom rug captures more litter than this . Not recommended .	-1
This is a cute-looking mat , shaped like a cat 's paw with a little cartoon kitty in the middle . Well , my cats hate it . They wo n't step on it and instead jump over it , as it 's not very big . So , it was no help at all in regards to litter scatter.Those plastic bumps on which the cats are supposed to wipe their feet are so hard , it must hurt their pads . Maybe this product would be better used as a `` scat mat '' to keep them off surfaces where they 're not allowed .	-1
This mat is cute looking , but that 's about it . My cat tracked litter onto it and then onto the carpet beyond , and I still always found myself vacuuming litter from her little area all the time . Also , if she ever misses the litter box and I have to clean this litter mat , the pee smell refuses to go away ( even with bleach and vinegar ! ) . I got the `` PetFusion SmartGrip Cat Litter Mat '' a few weeks ago , and it 's serving my needs far better than the Omega Paw version .	-1
I 'm new to cats . We have hard wood floors and the litter gets everywhere so i decided to buy one of these due to the rating . It 's cute but it really does not work well . At least not in the way that I expected . It seems to catch some litter , but by some , I mean a few pieces . I gave up and went to the hardware store . Bought a indoor outdoor carpet made of material that is threaded more like a door mat . I paid $ 10.00 for 3'x6 ' , more then enough . Cut it down a bit and its perfect . I found the cats need more than this Omega Litter Mat to get their paws clean .	-1
Bad : We have tried just about everything to reduce litter tracking . The cats have rejected everything from rubber mats of all sorts to the prickly mats they sell at pet stores , to the ribbed style mats like this one . In 25 years , over the lives of eight cats , not one has cared for any of these.These sometimes cute litter catchers do nothing more than spread more litter around by forcing our cats to hurl themselves out of the litter box so as not to have to set one soft paw on them.Good : What has worked is the indoor/outdoor Enviroback rug mat that can be purchased inexpensively from Home Depot ( sorry , Amazon - you do n't carry it ) . The mat is made from recycled plastic but , unlike the prickly mats , the surface has a similar feel under their paws to sisal . It has a low profile and is easy to vacuum with either the bare floor tool or carpet brush mode.Better : No perfect solution yet , though I 'm not sure there is one , but I 'll take anything that helps so long as my cats do n't complain . Keeping a stick vac in the bathroom near the litter room goes a long way toward keeping up with stray litter .	-1
This item could be much better if it was bigger . It works well when it comes to catching the litter that trails out when the cats use it but judging by the size of it , it seems to be made for tiny cats or maybe just kitten sized litter boxes .	-1
My cat is a beast I should 've known better . He 's a 19lb Maine Coon and he tracks litter everywhere . This is small mat , it 's like not even having one . I thought it would work because I bought the large Omega Paw Self-Cleaning litter box , ( which is awesome by the way ) and it has just an opening for him to get in and out . I put this right under the opening but he 's like like Godzilla and takes monster steps out with heaps of litter falling from his toes everytime he gets out . I would not recommend this mat to owners of giant cats , you know who you are , no he 's not poofy , he 's fat . It is an adorable mat though . The shipping was prompt and appropiate . However , I 'm gon na give this to a couple with dainty cats .	-1
I have a 2 year old Terrier/ Lab mix and she 's 45 lbs . I noticed that come this winter she was shedding a little more . So I used as directed and used till it was gone . I can honestly say that it did n't reduce the shedding . I do n't think her coat was dramatically affected , maybe it was a little bit shinier . I did notice that when I pet her I did n't get shocked as badly from static . I live in NH and its dry in the winter . So I think it did helped so her skin , and coat was n't as dry . But , for the price I expected more and it was only a months worth for this bottle ( 16 oz . ) . I 'm going to try giving her a human Omega 3 ( my groomer recommended ) and see how that goes .	-1
I used this years ago for my cock a poo and decided to give it a try for the two guys I now have . I hoped it would alleviate itching and shedding but did not accomplish either .	-1
My poodle is a nervous scratcher , so much so that she has patches of bare skin . This product has not diminish her desire to scratch . The hot spot spay works better than this . Waste of money . My dog hates the taste .	-1
My dog hated this stuff , in fact it smelled way too much like perfume and after I used it a couple times I noticed the dog was really itchy and his skin started getting really flakey . We ended up going with a different all natural , spray on , wipe off spritzer that worked a lot better .	-1
I have used Fresh and Clean products for years . I was looking for the original scent in the spray - the large graphics says `` Original '' but it sure does n't smell like my Original - original , more like a florist shop - do n't like the baby powder either.When I say I hate it , I 'm sure if you like the scent , it is awesome but when you want the original which did n't smell like a florist shop , you are disappointed ! That is all I 'm saying . I 'm sure the scent will last as Lanbert Kay 's products are great quality . Perhaps the scent has changed and they are calling it `` Original '' but it is n't , they need to find a new name for this one.Will probably be sending this back !	-1
Pet Pectillin is vanilla flavored and my two cats with severe diarrhea absolutelyrefused to take it . It may be useful for people with dogs , but I do not advisebuying it for cats !	-1
I hated the smell . My cats loved it . Did n't work at all ! A squirt gun works a lot better coupled with a shouted & # 34 ; no & # 34 ; .	-1
The smell is so strong and awful , it gave me a headache . I wish I could continue to use it , but the smell is just too strong . So , in short , it does work , but unfortunately , it keeps humans away also . LOL	-1
My kitten walks all over where I spray , I do not think it 's worth it and I have tried it many times . It 's a joke do n't bother	-1
I 've used this brand of litter many times in the past year , and have been happy with it . This last bag I bought was just awful ! It did n't clump at all , it was more like a fine-grit natural clay litter . With several cats , I was really disappointed .	-1
I have long searched for a good litter that would absorb and clump without pieces breaking off as you scoop . This is the absolute worst litter I have used in 20 yrs . Having purchased several scoopable litters this one more or less just became a piece of mud in the litter pan and never really activated with the urine to clump like most other litters of this type . What I also experienced was urine sitting on top of the litter . Tried this on a whim because of the price , what a waste . TIP : I have recently purchased Meijer 's store band scoopable litter and found it to be the best I have ever used , even better than Fresh Step . It clumps into a mass and scoops out easily . Not sure what to think about the good reviews here but can say my experience was not the same .	-1
This stuff is okay when my Premium Cat litter is n't available , but the stuff sends up dust . Wo n't buy it again .	-1
Terrible . Did n't hold form when being scooped . Crumbled into little pieces , and has terrible absorbency . I do not recommend purchasing .	-1
The fact that this had baking soda in it really means nothing . The smell of the cat urine was as strong as ever . The litter did not clump well and it seemed more like clay litter . Would not buy again .	-1
I have been deliberating between a seatbelt-secured car carrier or a seatbelt harness . The carrier , in principle , might be more dangerous in the event of an accident , in that your dog is flung around inside on impact ( sad face , I know ) . However , I do n't think this harness is at all safer , at least not for us . My dog totally gets herself all twisted up in this thing and could , theoretically , strangle herself ( or worse ) in a crash . And since you should ALWAYS keep your pet in the back seat ( no airbags there to harm them ) , it is obviously impossible for me to untangle her while driving . I will be going back to the carrier ( which , by the way , I finally was able to read was recommended as safer ) .	-1
Ok maybe I should have been more attentive to the details but this comb is really small . The picture IMHO is deceiving.In addition , the comb is not large enough to handle in an ergonomic way it is barely the size of my hand . Now if the comb had a handle that would be a better design.IMHO this would be a great comb for a child that is old enough or mature enough to comb the dog .	-1
Maybe this just is n't right for a corgi . For us the comb did nothing , I much prefer the furminator style for our dog .	-1
The prongs of the comb are just too short for a dog for full use . Okay for aroud the paws and ears .	-1
This comb just does not seem to get to my cat 's under layer of hair like I thought it would . Works fairly well on her bushy tail , but he does n't seem to like the comb when I use it . Am wondering if it hurts him as he always tries to bite at it when I use this and normally LOVES being brushed and combed .	-1
I have n't had a chance to use this comb yet , but it is well made and strong . I wanted a wooden handle over the plastic or rubber , and it feels great in my hand.EDITED AFTER FIRST USE.Was very disappointed to find that the little round collar part that sits over the metal to wood connection was loose . It jingles noisily up and down when combing . This was the very first time the comb was used , so not impressed . Will revise my rating .	-1
I was very disapointed when I opened the package . It looks good on the picture , but it looks so cheap in real life ! Like I got it in $ 0.99 cent store . Very poorly made .	-1
My cat does not like this product as it pulls knots out and apparently hurts the cat . Would not recommend this product it cat has long hair subject to tangling .	-1
Lady at the local pet shop recommended this for our 11-lb cats , who are very fluffy and take up a lot of space . I bought it because I needed to get one to the vet today.Picked it up by the handle , walked outside , wham ! The handle broke off , and the carrier containing my already-stressed cat fell down and bounced on the driveway.I 'm taking it back tomorrow and making certain to buy a different brand .	-1
These bowls are not big enough for a cat to put their face in to eat or drink . A waste of time and money for cats and dogs . I returned them . You should NOT advertise them for cats and dogs !	-1
There is no reason to buy this filter over the 2213EHEIM Classic 250 External Canister Filter ? 2213 . The 2213 is roughly the same size , it has full 13mm input/output unlike this filter which is only 9mm on the output . Also the 2213 has a canister inside which makes removing/changing media so much easier . Pricewise they are about the same and it is absolutely worth it since the larger output makes a huge difference in the flow . I use in-line accessories like a heater and an inline diffuser which slow down the flow of water so the added mm is a huge plus .	-1
Do n't bother . It is not high quality . It is always getting air in the motor and it will stop working . Harder than hell to prime . Way harder than a Fluval 304 and at times those can be hard to prime . It is just a pain . I hate it and am frustrated with it . I am no novice aquarist . My experience is not common , but for me I will never buy another Eheim product . All of the pumps , heaters and filters I buy from this company usually end up breaking , running loud or not working properly . I would highly recommend using either Hydor or Fluval . No matter what any , so called experienced hobbyist says , Hydor and Fluval are way more reliable and of higher grade construction . Everything about this filter is cheap .	-1
Look at the picture , see the little tube sticking out of the bottom ? That was completely broken off when I got mine . Return was a simple process luckily . I fail to comprehend the thought process behind the design , using fairly brittle plastic on a part that sticks out so far . Especially when they know you 're going to need to force a piece of tubing onto it . I love my other eheim ( 2236 ) but not this one .	-1
This filter arrived today , and I put it together as instructed . Well , let 's just say there were very few instructions , and the diagrams were absolutely useless . I had to look online for help , and there 's very little out there.Well , I finally got it together , and it was leaking at the intake . See that little tube at the bottom ? Well , I thought I had it tight , but when I primed the filter it started leaking , so I tightened it some more , and ... it stuck in the down position and would not budge . Moreover , while it looks sturdy in the picture , it 's pretty flimsy . It was stuck , and there was no way it was moving . My only hope was to try some pliers , which ripped the thing apart.This & # 34 ; filter & # 34 ; is now in the garbage where it belongs . I ca n't imagine how this got so many positive reviews . When I buy something , I expect it to work.Angry ? That does n't even begin to describe it . I 'm just not sure what to do now . I got this to replace a Fluval 306 because that thing was also a piece of garbage that broke after only two years due to flimsy construction . There just does n't seem to be a decent canister filter on the market . This is definitely not it !	-1
I ca n't even comment on how it works because it was broken right out of the box . I do NOT recommend . Terrible . Big Al 's at least took it back and refunded me . so I give kudos for their customer service . BUT I wish that I did n't get a crappy product . I went with Fluval 406 and have not looked back .	-1
Directions lacking quite a bit of info . I did n't use the in-line valves because I could n't determine if I really needed them . I rinsed the canister and filter material , connected everything , primed it and it went to work upon plugging in . Outlet tube in tank is loud so maybe I should aim spray straight down and raise water level ? Filter itself is basically silent . Would buy again.Edit : Would not buy again . Will not keep 30 gallon one goldfish tank clean . Water is constantly brown now . Does not work as well as cheap HOT filter from W.a.l.m.a.r.t . Was cleaning tank once every two weeks . Now every two days . Goldie is NOT HAPPY ! What am I doing wrong ? Any help appreciated.I did eventually install valves because I was cleaning the thing so much ... .Edit : Going back to Wally World hang on tank . I bought the separate poly and carbon media and tried that and took out the supplied rabbit pellets . Brown water , really ? This thing just will not work for me . Then the tubing is almost clogged with filth . $ 90 down the drain .	-1
You will see hundreds of reviews here swearing by these . Most of them tout how they have been using eheim classics for years . My inclination is to think that they are reviewing their filter that they have had for years and not a recent purchase . I bought a 2215 based on the sound comments in regards to the design of these filters . I thought I was getting a great product . The unfortunate reality is that the more recent canisters have been shipping with defective pumps . Within two months my filter did n't even have 1/4 of the flow it started with . Completely unacceptable as the lack of flow in my tank has started to allow algae to grow , kill my plants from lack of water flow , and make my fish sick due to lack of oxygen exchange . The 2215 seems particularly bad in this regard . Go to the tubes and do a search for & # 34 ; Eheim 2215 flow & # 34 ; and watch the horror show . Contacted the company today about this . I will report back their reply .	-1
This filter is NOT adequate for over a 35 to 40 gallon saltwater tank . It will only turn over the water in a 55 gallon tank 5 times in an hr . The minimum in a saltwater aquarium is 6 times per hour . Not sure how anyone came up with that 92 gallon number . I am very disappointed at the low flow rate . Very little pressure coming out of the flow nozzles at all . Is barely moving the water at one end of the 55 gallon tank that I have . Only buy this filter if you have a smaller tank . The verbage on top of the item description page is false . Also , the instructions are mostly in German . Get ready for the assembly to take a while to figure out . It is not easy to read or follow . Would only recommend this filter if you have a small aquarium that will not need much hourly flow or turnover .	-1
I used to have the original version of this disc ( Booda ? ) , which we loved , but bought this because it seemed the same from the literature and was less expensive . There 's a reason for that lower price ! The cheapness of the material was instantly palpable , and upon the first throw , within just a few minutes of one of my dogs doing the death-headshake on his way back to me , the plastic laminate on the back was peeling off all around . Next thing I know , both my dogs , being dogs , are eating the frayed pieces of laminate . So they 've just ingested a significant amount of plastic , oh yay . So a Total Nix on this product . Buy the original and be happy .	-1
Soft and cute . But it did not hold up for more that 5 minutes ! Got it for my golden when she was a baby . Those little sharp needle teeth destroyed it right away . I have a golden retriever . Better for an older pup and supervised in play ! Soft on the mouth .	-1
The good ... the pups loved it ! The bad ... it was torn to shreds in less than a day . The boys ... at the time were a one year old Miniature Pinscher and a one and a half year old American Eskimo .	-1
We purchased a different product : the 2-unit `` PetSafe 5-Meal Electronic Pet Feeder '' and one of our cats broke into it in minutes . Neither cat has broken in to either of our C10 feeders . The design principle is the same : a lid on an analog clockwork , but these have a more solid closure than the PetSafe product.Pros : - kitties have n't broken in.Cons : - kitties can open the lid just wide enough to receive an occasional kibble , so they 'll keep banging on the thing.- batteries are not secured , so kitties would knock them out , prior to my modification.- this does n't bother me , but the plastic collects a great many visible tooth and claw marks.The battery thing was a big concern , but with a screwdriver I was able to disassemble the base , and wrap tape around the clockwork mechanism to secure the battery . We have had a perfect operation record since.We started with one unit , but the cats were n't sharing . We got a second unit and put them in different areas , and now each cat will eat from their own feeder , even though they do n't open at the same time.One cat still wants me to serve breakfast in the morning , so when she wakes me up I just lock her out on the porch with a feeder .	-1
I bought this about a year ago , and it worked just fine for the first year . Now the lid no longer pops up . You can hear the timer working , but does not turn so the feeder will open . Not happy to come home to a hungry - angry cat . : (	-1
My work schedule changed so I needed a feeder with timer that did n't show the food that was going to be dispensed.Thought this would work.Have tried it 4 times , each time he gets it open and eats his food way before his meal time.So since it was n't inexpensive am returning it.Might work for others , it just did n't for my pet .	-1
I did a lot of research on Amazon trying to find a one meal feeder for my dog who needs to eat 3x/day due to inflammatory bowel disease . This was not only hard to use , but she could get it open right away , which negated my attempt to space out meals while I 'm at work .	-1
UpdateI really liked this feeder as I stated below but 4 months after both sides are not working anymore . The lids are off and my cat was not even trying to open them . I have tried to put tape but obviously it does not work . Very disappointed given the price , it is not a good deal.I was really looking for an automatic feeder for my cat . This works perfect ! I work from 9-6 and my cat eats mostly wet food , so to keep her to be extra hungry and give me an one hour of loud complains when I get home , I tried this one . I followed others suggestions and put a transparent tape underneath to keep the battery in place ( I agree with many reviews that the design is faulty ) , but once done , everything works well ( for me at least ) .The lids open every time at the specific time . I have a great cloud camera so I can see at what time it does open from work . And i have an active inquisitive young cat and she has n't been able to open before time ( perhaps 10min before only when the lid is starting to be loose ) . I saw this also with the camera.The can - I put one 2.8 can stays fresh and she always eats all.My only complain is that I use only one side for one feeding so I always need to remember to turn it off so the lids do not open in the middle of the night . You need to set them up to be able to close them.they open at 0.I recommend it to working cat `` parents '' with long hours and a wet-only cat feeding among others if course !	-1
I purchased this feeder for several reasons : 1 . We have two cats , and they were waking us up progressively earlier in the morning for their morning meal ; 2 . Our cats are fed three times a day , and this schedule would be untenable for most cat sitters when we are on vacation ; 3 . We felt that one of the cats was neurotic about his feeding times , and that he would act out by peeing on the our bed when he was n't fed on time.This device arrived just a few days before our vacation which would last seven days . I bought fresh batteries and tested it out before passing it over to our cat sitter , and it worked great . Our cat sitter only had to make one visit per day , and the cats were perfectly well-adjusted when we returned from vacation . As many other reviewers have noted , because the timer is analog , the opening time is not completely accurate , +/- 30 minutes or so . This is not a huge problem , but this means that when I 'm setting the timer for the morning feeding , I have to err on the earlier side if I do n't want the cats to wake me up at 7:00AM on the dot . I have not had a problem at all with our cats fiddling with or tampering with the device , but I could understand how if you did have a cat who was interested in getting into the feeder , the device could be damaged . The build quality is not completely solid , and while I can imagine using this device for several years before needing to replace it , I would love it if it were built to more durable standards : A higher quality plastic or metal that was more durable , weighty ; a lid for the battery compartment to prevent the battery from falling out ; a digital timer that was more accurate for feeding times ; A light indicator showing battery life ; a better insulated compartment to keep the freezer pack and food colder for a longer period ; some kind of sound alert when the lid opens . These are all on the wish list , but having read reviews for other feeders , I feel I have the best feeder this is currently available.Luckily for us , our two cats will share the food in each compartment , which means this device will dispense two , completely separate meals . This will be invaluable when both my partner and I are indisposed for the cats ' after work and late evening feedings . The cats are predominantly fed wet food , and because of the freezer pack , we can fill the first tray to open with wet food , and the second with dry food . We have radiant heat floors , and I had to find a section of the floor that was n't heated to place this feeder . When I checked on the wet food seven hours later when the lid opened , I was really surprised to find the food cool and relatively fresh ! None of the dried , discolored `` skin '' on the food when you typically leave wet food out for a period of time . The contents of the freezer pack was completely liquified and warm , but it had done its job of keeping that first feeding of wet food fresh . Our cats are finicky and will not eat food that 's been left out for a while , so this is a really great feature . The feeder only accepts one freezer pack , so I ordered a secondary one so that I could simply swap out the pack when I needed to instead of waiting for the one pack to re-freeze.I love this device simply for the extra time that I get to sleep-in in the mornings without the cats waking us up , and the secondary benefit is that the cats are beginning to completely disassociate food with us , so they do n't constantly beg us for food . Also , the one neurotic cat who demands to be fed on a precise schedule has not peed in our bed in protest since we 've gotten this feeder . It 's a win-win all around . My only wish is that the build quality was better , but this is a minor quibble since it works so beautifully for us . I may try to fasten/glue some kind of bell on the lids so that it would sound when it opens . Our cats are good in that they will not gorge on all the food available , but because the lid opens silently , the one cat who happens to be near or anticipate the lid opening will get the freshest bites before the second one realizes that food is available . I will gladly buy another one when/if this one peters out . ****7 September 2012 Update*******Sadly , I 've had to take away some stars and revise my review of this product . I really thought this was the holy grail of cat feeder conveniences , but after a recent vacation , our cat-sitter informed us that the cats had figured out how to get into the feeder . At first I did n't believe it , thinking that maybe the cat-sitter had incorrectly used the device , but after seeing it with my own eyes several times , I now know that this machine is not perfect . Because the device is entirely plastic , the cats have figured out that by hooking their claws underneath the trays , they can simply push it up and out from underneath the plastic lid . The plastic lid is so flexible , that it bends at will and is really not a secure closure for prying cats . They 've gotten so good at it , it 's almost like opening a drawer for them . I 've come upon the device where the tray is pulled out , and still hanging onto the front lip of the device like a drawer , and all the food is gone . My cats go crazy for dry food , but will leave wet food alone in the device . I guess they can smell which variety is in the device and figure wet food is n't worth their while to get into early . So now , I can only leave wet food in the device , which means I ca n't use the device for a second feeding of dry food 8 hours after the wet food has opened . To repeat , our cats are fed three times a day , and I thought this machine would help immensely , especially when we 're away and have to have someone drop in to take care of the cats . It would 've meant that they only needed to come once a day instead of twice . I am now in the process of transitioning the cats into twice a day feedings in order to become more routinized the next time we have to be away from the house . I even tried fastening the device to a very heavy wood block , but this only seems to facilitate their efforts as it gives them more leverage to pry out the tray . When it 's not attached to the block , the whole device moves around on the floor , and it stymies their attempts to an extent . I would love it if the manufacturers would re-design this device to be more cat-proof . The key is making the lid secure and rigid , and on a hinge that does n't pull out . I initially thought that having the lids pop out was a great idea for cleaning purposes , but now I realize that is a huge design flaw .	-1
I loved this product when I first got it ( purchased two as I have two cats ) , but after a couple of months they both stopped working . They were only used once per week , so we 're talking about maybe 8 uses before they did n't work anymore . The doors just would n't open . One day I came home and one had n't opened , which was unfortuneate because that meant that I left them without enough food . Shortly afterwards , the other stopped working . I called the company , who said that I could send it back and they would see if they could fix it . Well , by the time I pay for shipping , what 's the point ? Besides that , I do n't trust the product anymore and would worry that they just would n't eat one day . It 's just not reliable .	-1
I purchased a Cat Mate C20 several years ago . I loved it . However , after many years of faithful service , its gears wore out , and one of the timer dials stopped turning . So I recently purchased a replacement unit.Unfortunately , the design of the product has changed , and the timer dials on the newer units are very easy to rotate . My 16 lb . cat learned to stand on a timer dial with his front paw , then rotate his body around to turn the dial . What a smart cat ! Unfortunately it made the C20 completely useless to me.I compared the new C20 to my old one , and the timer dials are definately much harder to rotate on the old unit.At first I thought I had a defective unit . I contacted Ani-Mate using the form on their website . They quickly got back to me and requested I ship my C20 back to them ( at my expense ) . They very quickly shipped me a brand new replacement unit at no charge . Unfortunately , its timer dials were just as easy to rotate.I complained about this to Amazon , and they quickly issued me a refund , even though the sale was from an affiliated seller . So I am extremely happy with Amazon 's customer service , but dissappointed in this product . If your cat is very lightweight , or not as smart as mine , it might work for you . Otherwise , I do n't recommend it .	-1
The clear collar with the black trim and the 2 plastic snaps is a great collar . I bought them before and they worked great . I needed a replacement so I saw this and bought 2 because my old ones were kind of worn out . But , when I got them , they looked COMPLETELY different from the descriptive photo ( the clear color with the black trim and 2 plastic snaps ) . What I got was a new-designed collar with 3 velcro closures instead of the secure snap closures . Also , the edges do not have the black trim that give it structure so it 's easily bendable / crackable . You can see a photo of the product I actually received at Kong 's website at : [ ... ] .Also , this seller , The Paws DOES NOT respond to any customer emails or returns . They turn a deaf ear . I had to contact Amazon to start their A-to-Z Guarantee policy on this seller . If you get the exact item you ordered from this seller , then I think it 's OK but when things do n't match-up , do n't expect this seller to fix it . Beware ...	-1
I have a large lab and the XL collar fit his big neck just fine . However it was way too short in the length ( did n't even reach his nose ) and he was able to reach almost everywhere on his body without any problems . I bought this because one of his front toenails broke off and he kept licking it getting it infected . The snaps would come undone anytime he bumped into a wall which made this perfectly useless . I would nor recomment this collar unless your dog has a very short nose .	-1
My cat has been wearing this e-collar for a week or so and already it has broken . The velcro is adhered with a glue that comes off very easily . It seems in manufacturing they forgot to score the plastic to make sure the glue adheres . Anyway , I went out and bought a new one and realized it 's already coming apart , even before I 've used it ! Back to the store that one goes.Instead , I 'm keeping the original one which I 've glued the velcro back onto and affixed with staples ( pointy sides out so they do n't hurt kitty ) .Only reason I keep using this one is it 's the only one kitty ca n't get past to scratch . The other softer ones are nice but he find a way around them regardless . Just wish this was designed more sturdily .	-1
Got a small for my mid size spoodle when he was a baby.Though some token interest was shown initially - each time fleeting - the main attraction was that it bounces irregularly and you never know where it is bouncing to and puppy loved to chase and pounce on it . Did n't really catch on either but because of the size , puppy did token chew on it a little after catching it.Better than the dentals.psDo not leave outdoors , we lost it for a few months on the shady side of the house which gets sporadic son - it has faded a little and is showing miniscule scaly cracks.Love the concept though , just pooch prefers the natural eg soft bones etc	-1
We had two old Kongs this size , ( large ) that lasted for years . It was a toy I felt could be left available to the dogs because it was so sturdy . Well , one went missing so I got a new one . I could not believe my eyes . The young dog who had made no headway on the old Kong chewed the new Kong up in a matter of minutes . Shame on the Kong company for cheaping out on materials . They had a good reputation for many years . Maybe it is still made in the USA , but it could have as easily been made of Chinese rubber.+ Kong quickly replaced the faulty toy with a more durable one . We really appreciate their care and speedy service . Our confidence has been restored .	-1
When I ordered I believed large meant large . This Kong is more the size of a Yorkie dog . So when you order make sure you are getting the right size . I have to say it bounces good ! ! !	-1
I 've tried all the treats , the squeeze cheese , real peanut butter , etc . They work at it a bit , then ignore it .	-1
This was destroyed by my dog in the first day and seller has not responded to my return request.I got the large red KONG . And my 59lb pitbull mix tore the smaller top half of the KONG off . In the first DAY ! Perhaps my product was defective or maybe this product is just not all it 's cracked up to be . But I requested a return from the seller and it 's been a couple weeks and they still have not given me a return authorization . Shame on this seller and I will never buy another worthless KONG .	-1
My puppy destroyed this in hours . If you want a Kong for a strong chewer , this is n't the one to get . I ended up tossing it and getting a black Kong , which she has n't torn up .	-1
I bought 3 doggy products at the same time ( all treat dispensing chew toys ) . This is my recommendation of the best product of the 3.I bought the Premier Twist and Treat Dog Toy along with a KONG classic and Premier Tug a Jug for my 3 month old , 4lb Morkie . My dog does n't play with the latter 2 , but LOVES the twist and treat ! It 's easy to twist the top off and insert the treats and to twist it down to the size you want to get it to dispense . Smoothie quickly learned how to dispense the treats , so we have it on its tightest setting ( puppy chow is pretty small , so easy to get out ) . He chases and bats this all over the living room.He played with the classic Kong once , but because it dispenses the treats so quickly , he soon lost interest and went back to the twist and treat.He tries to play with the Tug a Jug , but he can never get anything out and quickly tires of it and goes back to the twist and treat.Of the 3 , the twist and treat gets the most use , its the easiest to clean , is hardy , has the best movement for him to chase around , & is the perfect size for a toy dog.So , if you 're looking to keep your dog entertained , do n't waste money buying a bunch of products , just get the twist and treat . Both you and your pup will be pleased with it .	-1
My dog is only interested in it when it contains a frozen peanut butter/oatmeal/yogut treat , but he wo n't play with it .	-1
Way too small . My 5 lb . Yorkie was n't interest in his Kong until I purchased a larger one . All my dogs get an evening Kong filled with left over frozen food . It helps them expend excess energy .	-1
My morkie broke this kong in less than a week . they need to make the smaller kongs more stronger and durable for small dogs .	-1
Bought this to keep my Min Pin busy . Waste of money . It was too big for her . She worked at getting the peanut butter out for about 5 minutes , some got on carpet , the rest she could n't get out . Never played with it .	-1
My dog , pit bull , was really excited to get this new toy . i filled it and gave it to her , and she chewed it into pieces in less than an hour . really disappointed thought that it would last longer . will try the extreme line next and hope for better results	-1
I ordered a Kong ... the one in the picture ... . the one you stuff with treats ? What I received was a giant red Kong BALL with no opening for treats and a handle on top . do n't forget the disclosure to not leave the toy alone with my dog . I gave it one star because my dog loves it anyway ... but I 'm confused .	-1
If you have a husky , get the black , extreme kong and get it 1 or 2 sizes up from what the Kong size chart recommends ( XL or XXL ) . You 'll save yourself the hassle from trying different Kongs and spending money while finding out.I have a 3.5 yr old female husky , 45 lbs took her 3 days to start ripping rubber pieces out ( big chunks ) . She does love the Kongs though , just make sure you get the right one : - )	-1
We just received this last night , and our almost 11 month old pitbull was definetly very focused on it , and it did keep him busy for a little less than an hour before he tore it apart . I 've never purchased a Kong before so I have no basis for comparison . It seems like a reasonably sturdy rubber , but definetly not indestructable , especially for any medium to large dog . I would n't say never for a different dog , but one would really have to watch them closely because the piece that was broken off could have easily been swallowed . Also , once the first bit is broken off , the pup realized he had found the weak point..from there to let him continue would have been dangerous . Definetly NOT SUITABLE to be left in crate with the dog .	-1
When I ordered a large Kong I assumed it would e for a large dog . My dog can fit the whole thing in his mouth and the cookies do not fit unless you break them into pieces . This defeats the purpose f the toy because he gets the cookies out immediately	-1
My little 50 # pittie blew thru this Kong with the greatest of ease . It seems I am going to have to start buying her tractor trailer tires for her to chew on , cause this pitiful Kong did n't make it . Within minutes , she had it in pieces . Do n't waste your money .	-1
This said it was a large toy . I guess KONG 's standards are different from mine because I do n't consider this large at all . I have a Lab and this would not have survived his chewing . I returned it . Amazon is great about returns , and I had no problems with my return process or refund .	-1
My 9-month Lab/Terrier mix tore the bottom half ( the bigger end ) off in a couple days going after the treats we hid inside . Not as indestructible as they promote . Too expensive for what it is , a chew toy ...	-1
It only lasted a week before my dog had destroyed it . He chewed the end right off and I found that he 'd pooped the rest out a week or so later . It was all in little bitty chunks .	-1
This product is not extreme and does not last long . This is my most disappointing dog toy purchase to this day .	-1
Posting a picture . 1 hour , 1 pitbull , garbage . He had it torn apart by the time I stopped him just to check and see how he was doing . Waste of $ 9 .	-1
I have , for years , bought the XL Kong dog toy . They always arrive perfectly 5.5 '' toys . These came at 4.5 '' . Went to PetCO and Pet Smart and their XL are 5.5 . Customer service was not willing to acknowledge their error . Will never order from them again . Went on line elsewhere and got them . 5.5 '' and this time , red ones , which are neat .	-1
I thought it was suppose to be extra strong but my vizsla still broke it into pieces . disappointed . k k	-1
The toy was described as `` large '' but was actually one of the smaller Kong toys on the market right now . Dissappointing since my dog is 90 lbs !	-1
I have an extreme boxer/pit chewer who destroyed this in half an hour . The small ring part split off . Thought it was just a fluke , so I returned and got a replacement that was destroyed in the same exact fashion . If your dog destroys every toy , this is not extreme as it claims to be . I 've had better luck with the Kong balls which are solid as a rock . Plus , the treat stuffer contains wheat , which did n't agree with him .	-1
I read in the reviews that the quality was not the same . When I got my Kong , it was smaller than I had expected and it smelled like oil . There was a clear difference in the way it appeared on the top portion of the Kong and the bottom . It was almost like the top was a different material than the bottom . I ended up buying one at Target instead because I was afraid to give it to my dog . The product is great , I 'm just not sure about the manufacturing of the ones that are bought through Amazon . China , I think is their supplier and who knows what you are getting when you buy something made in China . I would say on this China product , & # 34 ; Buyer be ware. & # 34 ; If you get one , go and compare it to the ones sold in pet stores . Smell it and see if it looks like the same consistancy before you let your dog have it . If you have a chewer , like I do , you might want to pay for the pet store version that you can touch and smell and see with your own eyes .	-1
Yes , it 's extremely durable and it 'll last a while ... but , it smells awful . My dog played with it for about half an hour and never touched it again no matter what treat I put in it . Waste of money in my case .	-1
The Kong table indicated the large Kong Extreme should be appropriate for my 1-year old , 55 lbs . doberman . I 've used Kongs before , but my puppy was able to rip chunks off the toy and there are more teeth marks than solid surface in the toy after 1 month of stuffing it with treats for her daily . My dog is not an excessive chewer and I expected more from the Extreme version .	-1
Durable bouncy but dogs just did n't like it put peanut utter , meat and treats in it they just were not interested in this toy . So now its sits in the corner of the yard of dedicated to the graveyard of forgotten and beat up toys . R.I.P . Kong toy	-1
My puppy managed to tear a huge chunk out of it in 15 minutes . I was rather disappointed as I have many Kong extremes and they usually last for months . The puppy Kong we have is 4 years old and still good .	-1
I 'm giving this 2 stars only because I have n't seem my dog really interested in this product . I bought this so he can have something to chew . lol So far no luck !	-1
This kong is really only good for very small dogs . I have a 50 lbs pit mix and I was scared she was going to swallow these whole . She tore through them very quickly . I 've used the larger size Kongs before and they work very well .	-1
I have a dog who is a strong chewer , and it 's been impossible to find durable toys for her . I had really high hopes for this toy , but she wo n't go near it . The first day , she was scared of it , and she would n't even take it when I put peanut butter in it , which is her favorite snack . I regret buying it , and now it 's back to the drawing board to find a durable toy for her that will last more than a few moments . Bummer .	-1
It was bought at Ross Dress for Less for 2.99 . If you are going to buy your stuff from there and resell it at least take off the price tag . my dog wo n't even go near it . it smells and taste like a tire . even when it is loaded with the treats he loves .	-1
I have tried several types of mats to catch the littler on my cats ' feet as they exit their litter boxes . This one was n't very good ( not that I 've found one that is great yet , but this one is worse than another brand I 'm still using ) . I 'm glad I only bought one , at a big box store , and was able to return it soon after.My cats had to walk on it going into the box , but coming out , they also mostly jumped over it ; so , it did n't help to remove much of the litter stuck on their paws . Also , I kept kicking it as I walked by , it was used with their litter box in the laundry room near the garage door , which then scattered what little litter was there on to the floor as well .	-1
my kitten jumps from the litter box to the floor to avoid stepping on this . She does not like it at all . I wish it was bigger so she would have no choice on stepping on it .	-1
No , it does not really fit right up against the Booda Dome Cat Kitty Litter Box , very well at all ! The Booda Dome is round and the mat is completely square ! Go figure ! If the mat was made for the & # 34 ; Booda Dome & # 34 ; they should have rounded the top of the mat so it fits against it ! It does MATCH the COLOR of the Booda dome , which is what attracted me to this mat.AND , , , it is made of hard plastic . It does have ridges , but since it is a hard plastic some of the litter bounces off , rather than being trapped like it would in the more pliable litter box mats ! At least it was only $ 8.00 with free shipping so not that annoyed . Would cost me more to return it .	-1
These no track mats are great , my RAGDOLLS track much less litter from box to floor , much less to sweep up.Thank you ... ... .	-1
Kong has severely downgraded the quality of their ropes over the years . This kong lasted about 10 minutes , and not because my dog chewed it , but because it does n't last during normal play - the dogs teeth grabbing the rope coupled with the intense throwing destroyed the rope . I can replace the rope , but not the thing inside that makes it float . It was supposed to be a pond toy . No longer .	-1
I usually love the KONG products , however , this Aqua dog toy had a metal washer inside of it ! My dog chewed through the rope within minutes and soon after got through the rubber . That is when I noticed something shiny inside and I pulled out an 1 inch metal washer . ( probably used to hold the rope inside ? ? ? ) I am so glad I was supervising him with his new toy ! Buyer beware !	-1
This is NOT a normal Kong with a rope through the middle . The rubber is much , much softer and more stretchy , and the inside is filled with a foam-type material , presumably for buoyancy but also to keep its shape when squeezed ( otherwise you could easily squeeze it in one hand ) . My German Shepherd loved it for the 20 or so minutes that it was in one piece . Unfortunately she likes to play tug in between retrieves , and the tugging force was sufficient to pull the hole in the top wide enough for the knot holding the rope inside to fit through , effectively removing the rope from the toy . Because of the foam core , I could n't just feed the rope back through the bottom hole , and I could n't get the top hole to stretch enough to fit the knot back through that way . So now I have a ropeless floating Kong , still works to retrieve but due to the shape and texture it 's not pleasant to pick up or throw , plus we ca n't play tug anymore . It should be clearly labeled that this toy is NOT good for tugging - waste of money for me .	-1
If you have a heavy chewer , this is not the toy to get . Unfortunately , within a day , my 45lb . aussie had the rope completely chewed through !	-1
I do n't understand the point of this toy . It does n't seem to clean my dog 's teeth at all . I even tried to put dog toothpaste on the rope or inside the kong part , but it ends up getting kind of moldy and gross . It 's fine as a general pull toy but that 's not how it was advertised . You 're better off just getting a strong pull toy and some enzymatic dog toothpaste or bones . My dog usually loves Kong toys but he ignores this one and it 's too much work for me to keep clean to use as advertised . Maybe puppies would like to chew on it ?	-1
This toy bought for my 17 month old `` chew through everything '' English Springer Spaniel . She liked chewing on the rope until I had strings all over my carpet - which by the way are hard to see and get wound around the vacuum wheels . Within about 2 days one rope was chewed through and then she lost interest . I eventually cut away both ropes but she still had no interest in the rubber KONG section - totally wasted money on my dog . Maybe other dogs will like these but they smell like rubber and that could be the `` put-off '' for my dog . I do not recommend .	-1
Dental Kong with rope is certainly not for strong chewers . The rope was in shreds and parts of it were even ingested by my 15-lb terrier in a matter of minutes . The middle rubber piece is strong and can hold up to the most avid chewers , but I definitely would not recommend the rope . In my opinion , it 's better just to buy the regular kong .	-1
My pups wo n't bother with this no matter how many of their favorite treats I put into it . It actually wastes treats , because my puppies left the treats in there and they turned hard and smelt bad.Also , I ordered two , and common sense would tell you if you order two they 'd give you both colors . Apparently that is n't the case . If you want to ensure you get a certain or variety of colors be sure to go the draconian route of e-mailing them your order number and color request .	-1
I have 3 dogs and not one of them have anything to do with this Kong toy . I bought it because my new 2month old puppy chewed on everything he could get his teeth on but he wo n't have anything to do with this no matter what I put inside .	-1
I wanted the blue one because I have a small male dog and I thought since I clicked on the blue one that is what I would get but it came pink ... I guess you ca n't get what you want which I think is very strange . I guess the customer is of no concern to them so wo n't be ordering from them again ... if you do n't care about the color its a nice toy but I think you should be able to get what you want .	-1
Unless this thing is filled with peanut butter she never goes near it . The Kong treats just fall out . No challenge there . I might as well donate it to my rescue .	-1
This toy was way smaller than I expected . My dog is only 10 lbs , but this small size is way too small . He was confused by it when I first presented it to him . Now it sits in the forgotten bin of toys in the cupboard .	-1
Frankly I do n't understand the hype about these toys . I get that they 're practically indestructible & you can put stuff inside them . But my puppy has shown no interest in this thing at all even though he loves chewing on practically everything . We tried putting stuff inside , and he successfully licked it out in about 5 minutes , but no chewing occurred . This & the nylabone seem like things humans want their dogs to like more than things dogs actually DO like . oh well.FYI : this puppy version is significantly softer than the adult version so probably better to stick with this for a puppy . ( still seems pretty indestructible )	-1
I have washed it and aired it and ca n't get rid of the rubber stink . The red ones have very little oder but the blue is offensively strong .	-1
The large is about the size of a baseball . This is a toy that seems like it would last forever . Neither of my dogs played with it much . It just collects dust .	-1
She is old , has bad teeth ( former owner never cleaned her teeth or took her to vet ) . She finds the Nylabone painful for her ( my young Pit Bull LOVES Nylabone , and so do I , and so does our animal shelter where I volunteer , but for an old dog something softer is needed , unfortunately , because it was a puppy size it was MUCH smaller than I thought and I had to throw it away for fear she 'd get it caught in her throat . But she did like the soft feel .	-1
I 've never had a dog that cared about Kongs . This is small , so any treat I put inside is either too small and falls right out , or too big and the puppy ca n't get it out . I 'm over trying to get my dogs to like Kongs .	-1
my cat hates this .	-1
I bought this to use on my ragdoll kitten because most of the reviews were really positive.But he hates being brushed with this thing and leaves as soon as he sees me with it . I think it might be uncomfortable because the rubber bristles kind of pull on the hair . He acts like it hurts so I do n't use it . I tried it on my own long hair to see how it felt , and yes it kind of hurt.But my boyfriend , who has very short hair , says it feels good . Yes , silly testing method , but hey . SO maybe if your pet has very short hair than this would be alright , long hair , maybe not . I tried it on my dog , who has short hair and he did n't seem to mind it .	-1
I 'm not sure why everyone else seems to like the ZoomGroom so much -- all four of my cats ca n't stand it . Even the two who usually ca n't get enough attention , stroking , and laptime duck away when this comes out . Very disappointed .	-1
Despite frequent stroking , I find that this does not get the cat off . I mean the cat hair off . Others note how with use a static charge will build and hair will cling . That did n't happen with me . Or the cat . Use a furminator followed by a microfiber cloth and you 'll get 'way more hair offa yer kitty .	-1
I do n't know if I 'm doing it wrong but it does n't seem to work well for me ! But I read the reviews before I bought it and people seemed to like it . I have now chosen this KONG brand over others since it is well known and twice in a row I am not happy . Goes to show brand name is not always better	-1
My cat is a Maine coon hybrid . When I used this on him , he seriously scratched me . He never did this before in the two years that I have owned him . That says it all .	-1
The reviews made this seem like a magical product , but in my experience , it 's barely worked . I 've tried it multiple times on multiple different cats and it really does very little . It pulls very little hair for the time and effort spent and when the hair does start to come off the cat , it does n't stick to brush , but rather falls loosely to the ground . Totally worthless and has been banished to the back of the drawer .	-1
We have a Goldendoodle ... who sheds . Unfortunately , this product just does n't do the job at all . As a toy , he would love it , and chew it apart in minutes . As a brush , it simply does not work on his hair .	-1
This did not work at all for our chihuahua terrier mix . Did not get any hair collected . I would not recommend .	-1
Not that it is a bad product , but I could use my hands to get as much hair ( shedding ) off my dog , so I really felt this product would not benefit me .	-1
Does n't really do much for my frenchie . He does n't like the `` spiked '' side and does n't like being pulled at by the rubber side . The static cling was n't really working either . It took off some hair , but not much ! I think it might work for a long haired dog , but not a short hair .	-1
I had high hopes for this brush . I get better results with a furminator and slicker on my Lab/Mastiff/Hound . I used it during a bath and saw little improvement . I am not satisfied with the performance of this at all . The only reason I give it two stars instead of one is because I paid less on Amazon then I would have elsewhere .	-1
I have two long haired dogs , one seems to shed more than the other so I tried this based on the reviews ... it 's just a big rubber brush ... It didnt help at all with getting the loose hairs out . I 'm going to just get a regular dog brush . I could see this brush being helpful when washing your dog though . But would n't recommend it for shedding	-1
I did n't really get too much hair from my Lab 's coat . Even if he 's wet , it does n't do the job . He really does n't like it either so he runs away . Probably the rubber skidding across his coat does n't feel good.I like the furminator !	-1
I have used this brush for a year now on my dog and cat , but am now fed up and looking for a different brush . My dog is a retriever/german shephard mix but she has very short , coarse hair and this brush seems to pull out some of the undercoat but then does not hold on `` like a magnet '' as promised . Most of the hair ends up on the floor or in clumps on her backside and tail . Also , I can brush her for a good half hour and 10 minutes later I will see more loose hair . The brush works sightly better on my cat as far as grabbing on to the hair ( he has a lot of very thin hair even though he is a short hair ) . Still though , most of the hair that the brush removes has to be hand-picked from his body or the floor . I would not recommend this product .	-1
This just does n't work for my dog . I use it on her , and then I pet her afterwards and she still has loads of hair fly off her . I just do n't understand how this thing is supposed to work . Maybe I 'm using it wrong . But I would not recommend this . Just get a normal dog brush .	-1
this did n't really do much for my long , straight , fine hair puppy . it did pick up loose hair but after using the zoom , i still had to comb her to untangle the hair and get it smooth again . so i just ended up using a regular comb instead of doing both . The zoom groom is NOT made from the same material as the kong toys so my puppy was able to chew parts off the zoom groom . once the zoom groom got chewed up even a bit , it would snag my puppy 's hair and also make the zoom groom really hard to clean . it 's going in the trash .	-1
I should have read the reviews . My puppy was choking on the yellow cover . DO NOT BUY THIS . I am disappointed in KONG for allowing this toy .	-1
I bought the large version of this toy for my lab/shepard mix who is 65 pounds . My dog can go through toys pretty quickly so I tend to stick with brands that create the most durable toys to make my money last a little longer . The rope on this toy is made of nylon , not canvas like some of the other kong toys , and because it is made of nylon my dog ripped through the toy in less than 5 minutes . I literally opened the toy and by the time I turned around it was in two pieces . I gave it two stars because I was still able to use the fetch part of the toy without the rope .	-1
Do n't buy it if you have an active dog ! My puppy is an average chewer but loves to work his stuffed toys . He ripped the green fuzz of the tip and tore off the tip after about five minutes of play . He had one day with it and now the green fuzz is its own blanket and the rubber part is in a dozen pieces . I 'm so disappointed with this - I thought Kong was supposed to be a good brand . Maybe for the rubber Kongs but the stuffed toys are hit or miss . This is a miss - save your money !	-1
My dog loves this toy , but I ca n't honestly give it a higher rating because it 's not as durable as it could be . The rope is plastic and flimsy and the only thing that has kept my dog from completely chewing through it is the fact that I steal it from him every few mintues and toss it across the yard to play fetch . After only a few times of playing with this , my dog stripped the yellow/green fuzz off of it in a matter of mintues . Maybe if the quality of the materials used in the rope and the covering of this were better , I would feel more comfortable giving it a better rating.UPDATE 4/10/13 : My dog bit this thing in half yesterday . I 'm well aware that this is not a chew toy nor was I allowing my dog to use it as such , but in the minute or two between him running to me with it in his mouth and me grabbing it to toss it across the yard again , it ended up in two pieces and I had to throw it away . The rope was still attached though , surprisingly . I 've down-graded my rating on this to 2 stars only for the lack of sustainability/durability . This toy was n't even played with every single day that I had it !	-1
When I first pulled it out of the box I thought I had finally found a good one . Wrong . My dog destroyed it in 2 hours . It was fun while it lasted .	-1
Am always on the look for toys for my Border Collie . He loves to keep himself entertained with a box load of toys . If only I could get his to put them back when he 's finished playing with them ... I tried this toy with him , but it did n't last very long . Pity because usually Kong Toys are of good quality . Unfortunately this one was n't .	-1
came apart in no time . I supervise my dog with this tossing to her playing , it came apart from the pressure of her teeth sinking into it . It simply split in half .	-1
This toy shredded more quickly than any rope toy my dog has ever had . I liked the minty smell but it became a ball of loose fibers way too quickly .	-1
We only had this light about one week and if I had n't thrown out all the packing info and box it came in I 'd be sending this back . Very irritated ! I will never buy this again !	-1
I bought 2 of these . The first one lasted less than a week and the other one , not even a couple of months . Big waste of money ! !	-1
I had bought EXO-Terra heat glo from a local pet store it did n't last long 2 months ; I purchase another one and it only worked for 4 days a burned out , returned for an exchange of a new one it only worked for 2 weeks and died so , I went back to exchange for the fourth one and it worked for 2 months and died . Yesterday I purchased the fifth one and it only worked for 13 1/2 hours ( i only use it during the day to help the UTH to heat up the ceramic tiles ) . I would only turn it on in the late afternoon by 2pm and off by 9pm . Before i purchase heat glo infrared bulbs , I always ask to have them check to see if the bulbs work . I do n't know if it is a bad batch or poor quality , but five bulbs having issues after a day or a few months ? This is not normal.My daughter also has a Leopard gecko and for the past 12 month went through 19 EXO-TERRA heat glo infrared bulbs , she checks asks at the pet store to see if they work before purchasing . We both only have them on in the after noon to heat the ceramic tile in the tanksMy daughter and I checked the clamp lights ( her tank and my tank ) with other bulbs and there is no issues with them . I ' look for a Heat Mat the can penetrate glass and a 1/4 inch ceramic tile to keep it at 90 for belly warmth . In a small apartment the rooms are cool and with balmy winters we are looking for a high quality heat lamp . We 'll look for another brand .	-1
I typically buy ceramic heat elements , but do enjoy the night view of my tanks that these bulbs provide . After trying these bulbs again , however , I will unfortunately have to switch back to ceramic , as these last a fraction of the time that ceramics do , especially if you are a user that will use the lamp 24 hours a day.My recommendation is to use ceramic bulbs for any heat needs .	-1
Ca n't hold enough water to last my little snake more than a week . I bought a much larger one and it works better than this one .	-1
I have 5 parrots all of different breeds and sizes . With the other berries they alljust rush for it knocking over anything in their way and eating to the end , no matterhow much I give to them.It is also the first time I purchased the Ccoatiels Nutri-Berries . I was surprised tosee the bits of berries not at all like the other Nutri-Berries . When I gave them tomy parrots they all went to hae a close up look and refused to eat . I believe it is thesize of the 'things ' that turned them off since they are accustomed to a big round treat not thesebits . Anyhow I did purchase 3 buckets and now with these on my hands I do notknow what to do cause they cost me over $ 500.00 to reach to my door.Will never purchase again .	-1
According to the directions I need to use an entire 12oz bottle to bathe my 100 pound German Shepherd . I think that 's way excessive and using a `` normal '' amount does n't work any better than regular shampoo . The smell is nice though .	-1
did n't work for very long . 2 weeks max	-1
This year has been a very bad year for fleas . I got both of my girls collars since they lick off the liquid medication from each other . It did not work for them .	-1
I 've been using this collar for 3 years already and it has been a success to keep the fleas and ticks away . I did notice that this collar has a funny and unpleasant odor to it , and it is particularly strong during the first few weeks of use . The other day I took my cat to see a vet and the vet was not happy about the collar at all . He told me that cat 's sense of smell is much better than us , and I should not use something with such a strong odor on the cat . The vet complaint that even he can smell it from a distance ( the collar was about 3 months old already ) and it must be very unpleasant for the cat to smell it everyday . He gave me some free samples of flea/tick drops to use on the cat . I feel really bad that I unknowingly use something so terrible on my precious kitty cat for such a long time .	-1
Unfortunately I did not know about the cancer warning on this until I received it . I waited too long to return this , and now I am stuck with it . I am now using an all natural cedar spray called Evolv by Wondercide . It seems to work well , but you have to spray it on all the time .	-1
My senior pekingese 's eyes suddenly got very weepy with alot of crusting from excess discharge.As she has never had this issue before , I thought it might be connected to the zodiac collar I had recently put on her.Sure enough , a day after removing this collar , all of her eye irritation ceased.In all fairness to the company , this was her first and only experience with a flea/tick collar , so she probably would have reacted that way no matter the brand.My only point is that sometimes a flea/tick collar just might be too harsh for some dogs to tolerate them !	-1
i really hated this , but not because of the what it is , because i never could get my dog to wear it .	-1
I have used Emu oil products for many different things and I had high hopes for this product but was n't as effective as I was anticipating for the skin condition of my dog .	-1
I bought this for my kitten Bengal . The plastic piece that you connect the leash too is in a terrible spot . It rests right on their shoulder blades and rubs as they walk . Another thing I do n't like is that the metal loop is fixed in place . So if they roll over on their back or rub against things it pokes them . My cats both use other harnesses fine but they hated this one . They walked around like they were drunk and kept falling over .	-1
Any figure 8 harness is dangerous ! I was trying one of these on my cat , so she could get used to it before we had to go anywhere using it.She immediately got her back leg caught in the chest strap , while scratching at it and trying to get it off . This tightened the noose around her neck dangerously tight ! The more she struggled to get her leg free , the more she choked herself ! Thankfully , I stayed in the room after putting the harness on her , to watch her . I was able to free her within a minute of her entanglement , but she was traumatized by the whole experience and I feel lucky that she was not injured.If you think about it , any harness of this design is a potential strangle noose . No matter how much slack you leave around the cat 's neck , if the chest strap gets caught on anything , the neck strap will tighten .	-1
We started our fuzzbutts on Marshall 's becasuse they are Marshall 's ferrets , warranty , etc . After some research on the internet we decided to try another brand . Our vet reccomended we try EVO which is a little more expensive but supposed to be healthier for the ferrets ( no corn and more protein . ) I would n't go so far as to say Marshall 's is bad since they have been in the ferret business for a long time . The biggest difference for our little guys has been their odors . Two of the first four ingredients for Marshal 's are fish . After we switched both the skin and litter box orders pretty much went away . With the Marshal 's we always used bi-ordor to help , we no longer have to use it . You should also note that ferrets do n't like to try new foods . They become imprented at a fairly young age and a one or two year old usually is not going to accept new food very easily . Change foods by mixing old and new gradually increasing the amount of new . They may ... .will experience some digestive upset ( scour ) which will clear up over a few weeks . Our vet reccomends having your ferret eat a couple different foods . we mix a small amount of zupreem with the evo so they are used to both foods in the event we can not get evo they are adapted to a backup . Hope this helps ... .	-1
Marshalls Ferrets Located on the east cost . Most places you BUY a ferret from , has a deal with Marshalls . ( Pet smart , Pet-co , local pet shops . ) The pet store will tell you how great it is , and if you want the warranty you HAVE to use and keep using this costly food . And true you do HAVE to keep using it , to keep your warranty . But I suggest you do some research . 1 . ) Not even close to the best food on the market . 2 . ) By the ingredients they would have you believe your ferret is closer to a cat then a weasel . 3 . ) Ferrets are carnivorous , that 's right they eat meat . Not berries , not bananas , not rice , not corn , not wheat , not sugar . They eat Rabbits , mice , deer , ducks , anything with blood hair , feathers , teeth , bones ... ect . The only time they would eat vegetation is when they consume and animal such as a rabbit and they eat it 's stomach contents . Does this mean ferrets are the small animal kingdom equivalent to pit bulls and will attack your family members ? No ! Do they bite ? Nip ? Yes like any other animal you would bring into your house . Can it hurt ? Draw blood ? Of course . Just like dogs and cats who nip , you need to train them not to , and it 's easier then the latter two . Anyway back to Marshalls . Keeping your ferret on this food and this food alone with shorten their life spans , and health problems will happen more easily . Why the company that breeds most ferrets in the United States would promote and make such a crappy food is beyond me . But I suggest Wysong brand or a natural diet ( frozen whole rabbits , ducks , mice , rats , Or live small rodents ) Never feed your ferrets popcorn ( EVEN THOUGH THEY WILL LOVE IT ) crackers or people food.BTW I had a ferret I followed strictly on a Marshalls diet he got ferret diabetes and died , after 3 years . his sister died within a year and 10 days . I have three ferrets , a Boy who is 5 years old and two girls who are 1 . My boy will live till at least 12 or 13 . Ferrets should live between 10-15 years , on the right diet . ferrets are forever pets do not treed lightly . I have had two ferrets I adopted live to 14 years on natural diets .	-1
I bought these to help me potty train my ferret.On the plus side- he likes them and they smell goodDownsides- Ferrets can not digest anything other than meat protein and these treats have corn/corn syrup/glycerin and wheat . None of these things are good for ferrets and can actually lead to disease later in life . I 've switched to Ferretone and cooked chicken as a treat .	-1
But these are soft and in a very small bag . I though i was buying a harder treat to chew on and that wasnt swallowed instantly . Its probably not a `` bad '' product but not what I thought I was buying .	-1
Ugh . The knob on the back of this tray broke after a week . If that would have stayed on I would have given it 4 out of 5 stars . It 's pretty big too ... double check measurements before you buy .	-1
The quality is good if you do n't need to ever take your dog on a walk using this collar . The D ring is barely big enough to even attach the dog 's tags and certainly not big enough to allow you to also attach a leash.I tried every was possible to find a way to use this collar without also using a second collar for walking my dog . Finally I gave up and contacted Amazon . They issued a full refund immediately and told me I did n't need to return the collar.I recommend not buying this item in this size . Maybe if you get larger than a 16 & # 34 ; it may have a bigger D collar .	-1
This one simply does n't work as well as the one for cats . They SAY it has the same formula . My litterbox says differently . Ever since they changed it & # 34 ; for small animals & # 34 ; it simply DOES NOT WORK .	-1
The title says enough . Mousse tried to escape , got stuck and suffocated to death . Do not Buy ! This is definitely a hazard !	-1
Flimsy construction , easy for small dogs to open up the side and let themself out . Not recommended for small dogs , works o.k . for my baby rabbits to play in the yard in or as a temporary gate over a large door opening .	-1
I tried the FURminator trimmers , which were terrible . These are really not much better . I recommend a guillotine trimmer for an dog who has thick or tough nails . These will only twist the nail to the side when you 're squeezing and the sometimes not even cut through . NOT a good experience for any fur baby .	-1
Purchased this in the LARGE size ( MEANT FOR MEDIUM TO LARGE-SIZED DOGS ) to clip my German Shepherd 's nails and sorry I did . It 's not sharp enough and does n't cut well , no matter how I hold it and instead of cutting his nails , it crushes , cracks and splinters them . Judging by the way he squirmed and whined , it must hurt him too . ( The guillotine version was n't any better either . ) It might work better for a smaller dog , but not for a larger one . Will not use this again . Instead , bought a Dremel brand nail grinder with a rechargeable battery pack which works wonderfully and he does n't mind getting his nails done at all .	-1
I have used many , many items to trim my cats ' nails , right down to finger nail clippers . I have two very well behaved cats who tolerate pretty much anything I need to do . My male has large claws - thick and dark . He hates having his toes done mainly because I think the quick has been nicked a few times too many , and not by me . He was a shelter cat.It 's hard to see the cutting edge on these . The way they 're made it 's not like scissors would work . The guard is going to give you a false sense of safety for your pet . If you have these , push that sucker aside and use your own eyes to judge . Because of how they 're made , they squeezed/crushed the nail before cutting it ... this pinches the quick . That 's painful too.They 're not easy to use . They 're very easy to lose your grip and you ca n't keep the edge on the spot you want to cut . It only takes one bad experience to spoil an animal 's trust of the activity . I 'm lucky in that my boy is well behaved . My adopted feral girl might not be so forgiving . So , I ended up going back to the scissor style ones I had ... even tho ' they 're dull and need replacing , they were less of an issue than these are brand new.And for all of the people who tell you to get a styptic pencil or something - how about NOT cutting them to begin with . If you make a claw bleed , you 've already caused pain to your pet . You do n't just apply the styptic and move on . You try not to hurt them in the first place . So I 'd take all those reviews lightly . I 'd much rather read the reviews that say that the claws were trimmed well and without trauma to the pet . In the case of this trimmer - that is not the case .	-1
This is completely my fault , but I refuse to use this product.I really tried , though . The first time , I settled down next to my dog , put one of her nails between the trimmer and lightly squeezed . Nothing happened . I could tell I would need to exert A LOT of pressure to actually cut her nails . ( By exerting medium pressure I cut grooves in her nails , but nothing else . Nothing close to trimming . ) Maybe I just do n't know how to use it properly ... Or maybe my dog is too big for this product . I do n't know.I 'm think I 'm going to buy a grinder instead .	-1
When I got it in the mail , ( shipping was fine ) it specifically said & # 34 ; just for dogs & # 34 ; on it , and I specifically bought it for a cat . Nice clippers , just not for me ... Fail Safari . You should probably advertise it just for dogs .	-1
I like this trimmer a lot I have in large and small . I am having difficulty with the nut falling off the back , especially when cutting the larger thick nails . It can be put back on but a pain .	-1
After using the trimmer a few times , the guard will not stay in place . I only feel comfortable cutting my dog 's nails with the guard up , so now I have to buy another one . I would n't recommend this trimmer .	-1
These are indeed very sharp and will give a nice clean cut . But the safety guard does n't really work ? My dog had her nails done at the groomer about a month prior and I wanted to just test these clippers out and take off a little of the edge of her nail just to let her get used to being clipped at home . I had used the little metal plate ( which I assume is the safety guard ) and clipped two nails . Well , after doing just two I noticed there was blood on the ground and yep , I cut my dog 's quick . Granted , it was n't spewing blood like a crime scene , just a few smears of red on the kitchen floor but to advertise that the safety stopper is effective is well ... it 's not.Back to the groomers then !	-1
It 's sharp enough , but the guard did n't work at all . I drew blood from the nail of our rotten blue ( rottweiler/heeler mix ) . I had n't heard him whimper like that since he was a puppy . I felt bad and he no longer felt like cooperating with my endeavor . We 'll just get a Drimmel .	-1
I 'm sorry I bought this impossible toy . The instructions on the box do not match the product . In order to open it , you are supposed to insert your finger into hard plastic and turn . I had to put on a glove as it scratched me so much . It 's very difficult to open and to close . The instructions include difficulty settings and there are none on the ball . The dog would have to bat the ball like a cat to get it to work . Waste of money !	-1
This toy is ok , it 's just not for my dog . The downside : the hard plastic is so smooth it does n't roll well . It slides around , even on carpeted surfaces . I put strips of duct tape on all sides of the cube to give it traction , which helped . Of all my dogs food toys , this one is her least favorite . She loses interest quickly and will walk away from it when there is still food in it . This has been the only toy she has done this with .	-1
We fostered a dog and bought him a bunch of toys to keep him entertained while we were at work all day . Some of the toys he loved , but this one scared him . The plastic is think and hard , so when he would roll it from side to side it made a loud noise from the impact on our hard floors.I think it would work better with carpeted homes . Also , it can be pretty tricky for dogs to get the treats out , so I would say this is an 'advanced ' toy .	-1
This cube was hard plastic . It made lots of noise.My young Vizsla seemed to enjoy the orange OmegaPaw treat ball , Star Mark and Kong treat dispensers .	-1
Dog is not interested in it at all . Even when full of her favorite treats ; she always prefers her kong .	-1
This toy is a waste of money in my opinion . It is made of a hard rigid plastic so you would n't want your dog to play with it in the house if you have tile or wood floors . It would scratch them and make a ton of noise . The treats come out really easy making it not a challenge at all for the dog . My dog never touches this toy . Not a winner .	-1
I was in the same room with my schnauzer when he suddenly went nuts and there was blood everywhere ! the middle insert came out and he got his teeth caught in the cube trying to get to the food . NOT SAFE ! he was hitting everything in his path and it took a few minutes to calm him enough to lower his head and get his teeth out of it . We wo n't use THAT again EVERIt is also VERY difficult to put the food into , you need good finger dexterity to accomplish that feat . This was truly a waste of money.This deserves a ZERO star .	-1
I put a few pieces of dog food in it to see if i could get them out before I gave it to my dog ( she has chewed through toys before when she could n't get food out ) and I could n't get the dog food out . I do n't think that my dog would have been able to get her food out and she probably would have chewed through it .	-1
I returned this . I was excited to get it , but did not expect it to be the hard brittle type plastic . I decided it was n't what I was looking for . It did n't look like it would last . Of course I did n't really give it a try .	-1
Neither I nor my dogs could get treats out of this ! I shook it and rolled it every which way , nothing came out . It was n't easy to load , either . I tried it with tiny treats , it made no difference.I tried a few different times , we could n't get treats out of it , so the dogs quickly lost interest . My friend said it 's her dog 's favorite treat dispensing toy , so I gave her another one instead of tossing mine in the trash .	-1
IT is hard to get this clean . You can soak it , but then it 's hard to get it dry . Since it is plastic , I do n't want to put it in the oven . Also my dogs ( Blue heeler mix , Miniature poodle/cocker mix ) do n't enjoy it was much as the Kong toy . I think that 's because the Kong 's movements are wobbly and more erratic -- more like prey . This cube just clunks over and they lose interest .	-1
Just got this and realised it 's made of hard , brittle plastic . For some reason I expected it to be a `` Kong-style '' hard rubber ... my mistake . I was a bit surprised since not many manufacturers have the sense not to make dog toys out of materials that could hurt the animal . Anyway ... about 10 seconds after giving it to my dogs and at the first bite of the toy and I hear a cracking noise . The uneven seam where the two halves are glued together is splitting . Will be returning this .	-1
My lab loves to play with various treat balls , but I do n't recommend this one . It does not easily roll and play time gets ruff with my dog pawing at the cube and picking it up and tossing it . In the process the `` plug '' comes out and all the treats follow . The plug also then becomes a choking hazard if you have a chewer . There are other options that provide a better experience .	-1
Hair is hard to get off the brush and does n't comb as good as I thought it would . But its ok . Better on horses not on other animals .	-1
Had high hopes that this comb 's blades were sharp . Not . At . All . It had the sticking quality reminiscent of a tin can lid being dragged through my dog 's hair . Definitely not sharp enough to cut without discomfort . My dog does n't even have heavy matts and this comb could n't slide through her hair . Soooooooo dissappointed .	-1
seems to be pulling out lots of unmatted hair ... hard to maneuver ... . and this is on a very cooperative dog .	-1
I have a yorkie-poo and she has very fine , soft hair and it mats really easily , but this does n't help and I feel like I 'm just dragging this comb thru her fur and it pulls , which hurts her . The teeth need to be sharper to be effective .	-1
It 's inexpensive ; I 'll give it that . As for removing mats , I did n't like it . It did n't slice through them easily and really just seemed - after much effort - to rip the dog 's hair out . It 's hard to get the blades into the mat in the first place .	-1
I bought this to try to get mats off of an exceptionally sensitive dog . He howls if this thing comes near him now . This might be better for younger , less neurotic dogs , but has been sitting in a drawer here for a few months now .	-1
Be really careful when using this ! I bought the smaller version , Safari Mat Remover for Dogs , too and for a small dog , that is much easier to use .	-1
we originally bought for food and water BUT the water kept seeping passed the hole at the edge for lift the chrome bowl out to clean or refill ... though the quality seemed to be there , we will be donating these items .	-1
My 20 lb mutt could not get her snout in there to eat in a comfortable manner . Further , her long ears dragged in the water bowl beside the food bowl , making a mess . I ca n't use it .	-1
missing hanger for door ... very disappointing..why they would ship this to me when it was obviously missing parts is a mystery	-1
My suckerfish loves these , so he would give them 5 stars , but I 'm just not impressed with the size of these pellets . I had the same bag I purchased from a petstore ( for more than these ) , so I did n't think twice about ordering this bag . What came are very tiny pellets . I have a large suckerfish so I have to feed him 3 tablets to make up for the 1 I would feed him every morning . In the end I 'll have to buy another bag sooner than I hoped because of the small size of these tablets . If you are used to the larger tablets then keep looking . These are n't the ones for you .	-1
As cute as this item is , and my dog loves talking toys , it broke as soon as he bit it . Not only that , the & # 34 ; talking & # 34 ; part broke into pieces , and that could be dangerous for dogs . Do n't buy this for your dog !	-1
I bought this pig based on reviews and though it was cute . Our dog likes to chew stuffed animals so we only give this to her for short amounts of time while keeping an eye on her .	-1
I love this line from the product description : '' This pig looks and sounds so authentic you and your pet will think it 's real. '' Uhh ... yeah . There 's a serious problem with your dog if he thinks this is an actual pig . There 's a REALLY SERIOUS problem if YOU think it 's real ! That being said , it 's a cute little pig that has a hard plastic center that oinks . My wiener dog was `` put off '' by the oinking and did n't want to play with it . My friend 's Shih Tzu was happy to accept the toy and LOVED playing with it . He is not a very destructive dog with toys , so it held up well ... but a rougher/bigger dog would destroy this thing in no time . It stopped oinking after about a year of gentle play.Also , I would worry that a dog that is tough on his toys might open this piggy up and EAT some little electronic component from the sound-making device ... or the battery ! : - (	-1
We had purchased several other toys of this type from the same manufacturer and our dog loved them . We actually bought one two times because she got sick and made a mess of the first one . THIS one , however , has the most annoying noise of any of her toys and we constantly hide it . Also , I have to say that these are not very hard for her to tear apart and you will have stuffing all over your floor , if you 're not watchful . We have a 4 month old Lab . Great toy , otherwise .	-1
This is advertised as `` Talking '' but it is deceptive advertising and an outright lie.My Yorkie loves her talking Babble Ball so I thought this talking monkey would delight her . She is not amused.The monkey makes ONE SOUND ONLY : SCREEEEECH . This screech is not even a monkey screech , it is a jungle bird screech that is very annoying .	-1
It scared my dog , it is hard and the sound is more like a shriek than a cute monkey sound . Not great for small dogs .	-1
The sound stopped almost immediately after the first use . It was cute while it lasted , but not worth the money !	-1
I have a Chihuahua and a Yorkie and they both play with it . The barking sound is not too loud and really amuses them . This is our second one , they stop working pretty quickly .	-1
I really did n't like these to much . They are small but the rounded tips are a little to big for trimming around the eyes .	-1
I bought three pairs of Millers Forge scissors . Three different kinds . Small , curved , and thinning . They are all blunt and simply do not cut at all . Since I did n't buy them from Amazon , returning them will be a real nuisance . I replaced them with Geib scissors , and there is simply no comparison . Perfect cutting action , smooth , and sharp . P.S . I have no affiliation with Geib . That was just the brand I tried next , and I 'm really pleased with them .	-1
Products blades dont match up at all to cut.There is a space that you can see through.These are worthless.I ended up buying the Miracle Coat 4 & # 34 ; Ball tipped Scissor Which are quality made !	-1
I ordered these for Mrs. Spudman to use for trimming the feet and ears or our shih tzu and our bolognese puppy.Unfortunately she found the pair we received too dull to be useful . In fact , she compared the new pair to a very similarly designed pair bought a year ago at CVS . The older pair is sharper and cost about the same as the pair ordered on Amazon.We do like the blunt safety tips of the Tiny Dog Grooming scissors , a desirable feature for scissors used to trim a squirming puppy . The scissors also fit the fingers comfortably and open and close smoothly.My take on the range of ratings given for these scissors is that the blade sharpness and quality control at the factory are inconsistent . The Tiny Dog Scissors do seem to work a bit better after a few swipes with my blade sharpener.Shipping was quick for this item , and it was packaged well .	-1
These work but are small and there is play between the blades , making a clean cut somewhat of a challenge . Definitely better than a hammer and chisel so I guess there is a silver lining..	-1
I think the blade is okay , but the sleeves kept sliding off . It is hard to hold on to the clipper when the sleeves kept sliding and does n't give me a good grip . Makes me nervous that it will slip mid-clip and I will end up clipping my dog 's quick . I would n't use these again . I also had to stop after every clip in order to readjust the sleeves . It slowed down the whole process . Also , the blade seems to dull after a few sessions .	-1
I 'm a dog groomer and cut at least 8+ dog 's nails a day.I simply do not like these . The guard is annoying and I ca n't get it off , the handle opens too wide and is hard to get my hands on , and these are just awkward for me to use . These seem to work for a lot of people but are just not right for me . I prefer the orange kind made by Miller 's more . I 'll keep these as a back up but prefer my orange pair more .	-1
I have used an old pair of these for years and they were left ouside in the winter so they rusted shut . They worked great and were made in the USA.The new ones I ordered here on Amazon looked the same on the monitor but when I got them , they were cheap , had poor tension and were MADE IN TAIWAN ! Pretty crappy that they would show made in the USA on the product photo . It 's dishonest and deceptive.The clippers worked poorly and I even made my dog bleed when it pulled and tore off his nail instead of cutting it off crisp and clean as it is designed to do . I looked at the blades and there was some play in it that probably caused the pliers to squeeze and tear instead of cutting clean.The nail guard does not stay in place and swings around freely . It 's frustrating when you already have to concentrate on getting it over with and keeping your dog happy and comfortable.The safety lock also was loose and would lock up the unit when you moved on to the next nail.The big kicker to this once great tool was that the rubber dipped handles separated after a whopping 10 claws on my dog . They just kept sliding off more and more.Too bad people outsource their great products overseas . I would pay twice as much for something that can be made by people who have high standards , good materials and excellent quality control.Goodbye Millers Forge , It was nice to know you over the years . I 'd wish you good luck but it was your choice to kill American jobs for a quick shareholder profit.Shame on you for showing the Made in USA label and then selling your knock offs . These are nowhere near the American steel clippers that were handed down to me .	-1
This clipper starts out with a dull blade , and the replacement blade it comes with is also dull . Very hard to get the blade to slice through the nail , and when it finally gives way with a loud whack , it jaggedly cracks the poor dog 's nail and leaves broken edges , torn bits of nail that remain and you have to cut off , and worst of all , it cracks and chips pieces of nail above the point you are cutting . This leads to pain for the dog ! All other people 's reviews on other sites of this product have stated the same things I have here . Even one groomer who rated this clipper and said she had been a professional groomer for 20 years said `` it 's the suckiest clipper ever made . '' No one believes this clipper is any count at all except Millers Forge themselves ! I am so sorry I wasted my money on this . One use and in the garbage can it goes .	-1
I bought these clippers after i broke a cheap plastic pair . I have a German Shepherd and a cat . These did n't work for either . The clippers are n't sharp enough to make clean quick cuts on the dogs nails , and I thought i would still get some use out of them by using them on the cats nails , but they still would n't work . They just bent the cats nails and did n't really clip them at all . I would n't recommend these clippers to anyone looking for something sturdy or sharp , which is what i assume most people are looking for in nail clippers .	-1
While my dogs absolutely love the gorilla , they broke it within an hour and he had to be thrown away .	-1
My golden retriever is gentle on his toys and they tend to last for several months . The & # 34 ; talking & # 34 ; feature on this one worked for the first 2-3 presses before it stopped functioning . I 'm pretty sure it was defective upon arrival , the piece that controls the audio was in a strange spot down near the legs and stuck out badly . It 's still in one piece and functions as a small stuffed animal , but the lack of a squeaker or chimp sound means my dog is bored of this broken toy .	-1
My dog is really good at destroying anything . She can destroy Kong products easily , and she is only 42 pounds . She loved this at first but her goal in life is to remove squeakers , etc . This toy has a circuit board , batteries , etc . When I saw her chewing on those I was not impressed .	-1
I wish these talking toys had a more durable talking mechanism . They are very hit or miss : I 've had them last , and not last , This one became silent in about two days . My dog 's not interested if the chimp does n't talk , so this was a quick waste of money .	-1
My Pit Bulls loved this toy ! It only lasted about 10 minutes then I heard a crunching sound . It no longer made the chimp sound and the batteries fell out through the damaged hole . This is not big dog tough !	-1
I have a rescued Boston Terrier that had no idea what a toy was until a few weeks ago . We gave him this and after initial uncertainty , this became his favorite . That lasted about a week and then the toy lost its ' voice . He did n't play with it that much or that hard , thus my low rating . Cute idea , appealing toy while it lasted , but it did not withstand Reggies ' play . Too bad .	-1
The toy was a bit smaller than I expected , which is fine . The thing my pups & I did n't like was the noise . My pups have loved the other Look Who 's Talking toys because of the noises they make ( cow=moo , etc ) . This one has a child 's giggle/laugh as the noise . I 've been diligent in teaching my fluffy kids to play nice & gentle with human kids , especially not putting their mouths anywhere on a human ( unless giving kisses as asked ) . My pups wo n't play with this toy because the child 's giggle & I 'm not inclined to give it to them . I do n't want my pups associating a child 's noise with something to bite .	-1
These look like they would work fine . I read the product description wrong though . I thought it said 3oz , not 3.5 inchs . Alas they do n't work for my 3 oz cans !	-1
The product itself is fine , although it is falsely advertising when it says the product will fit any size can . Amazon suggested these as an add-on to my purchase of the 12.5 Oz cans of Wellness Cat Food , and these do n't fit .	-1
These covers do not fit any of the three brands of canned food I feed my dog . Should I have measured the cans first ? Maybe , but when the description says , `` Perfectly sized to fit just about any type of pet food can , '' in the ad , I just assumed that included the name brands I use like Wellness and Merrick that are in `` normal-sized '' cans .	-1
These lids are made more cheaply than the nice set I got at the dollar store . the dollar store set also has cute raised paw designs on them . When the store ran out of them I bought 2 of these sets at Amazon , and I do n't like them . They all have `` Spot '' written in raised letters on them . I have a cat - not named Spot . They also costed me more than 3 times the price of the ones at the dollar store.These fit only the 5.5 oz . cans of cat food , not the 3 oz . cans . I do n't know about dog food cans .	-1
I actually bought Petking lids ( four pack in colors with paws and tabs ) on Ebay . The answer I was looking for was no where to be found . Petking lids said they fit 32 oz and 16 oz cans ... which was also no help when I needed them for 5.5 oz Cat Food cans . But ... I did find someone to tell me that the lids I bought fit 3 5/8 cans ; which is the 5.5 oz size . SO ... if you are looking for lids for cat food in the 5.5 oz size Petking can covers Will Work ! ! : )	-1
very cheap and flimsy , id rather have bought another one at my local grocery store , they are much sturdier . i only got these cause there was a pink one , big mistake !	-1
They do n't make them like they used to . Frankly this is a total waste of money and materials - my last one hung around for years and this one bent on the first use.Get a heavy duty scoop - I do n't like plastic and prefer no coatings on handles , but anything would be better than this .	-1
this is a cheap and very flimsy product . I immediately regreted spending hard earned money on it . Dont waste yours money on this one .	-1
Our husky destroyed this in under 10 minutes and that resulted into a lot of small pieces that could have been swallowed .	-1
My 35lb lab mix destroyed this in less than a minute . its made of cheap rubber and any dog big enough to get it in their mouth will easily destroy it .	-1
My dog loves playing ball but hates this ball with a passion . It is very hard plastic and not easy for her to grip . I was hoping to get a ball that bounced erratically when thrown but this one does not	-1
Ethical 5 inch gaint squeaky dog toy is a great toy for large dog . A good product that would last for a dog .	-1
Wow . This ball did n't last 5 minutes . But it was a glorious 5 minutes ! I guess my dog is a more aggressive chewer than I thought .	-1
Within 15 minutes , my 6 lb dog had figured out how to squeeze the ball in half in order to make chewing off the bumps easier . This ball is not for dogs that like to chew .	-1
This ball was bigger than I thought it be and is hard pastic . This would be a great toy for large dogs .	-1
The ball it 's self is fine but it is heavier then I expected . Because of it 's weight it is not a light push and my puppy lost interest in it fast . I was going to return it but the shipping charges and possible restock fee were almost as much as the ball .	-1
My dog absolutely LOVES and is obsessed with this toy . It is her all time favorite . Unfortunately , it is very hard on the teeth and has worn down the sides of her lower canines tremendously . She now has very short and sharp lower canines and I had to take the toy away from her.She played with it for hours at a time , but I just cant let her have it anymore	-1
This is the first toy that I have ever bought my dogs that they absolutely refuse to play with . I bought the 14 inch purple one and it is so hard they will not even go near it . My one dog runs away from it when it is rolled near him . I did not realize that there were hard and soft Jolly balls . This is like rolling a rock . Shame it is going to cost me almost 8 bucks to return it . I would never have ordered it if I had realized that it was hard	-1
At first this was the BEST toy ever . he LOVED it ! But after playing for a while I noticed that both of his front feet were swollen terribly ( they looked like balls themselves ) . I had to take him to the vet and get xrays and prescription anti-inflammatory medication ! What an expensive mistake . The ball is just too hard !	-1
This ball was for my Border Collie mix who loves to push/roll balls around the yard with her front legs and chase them . This is very heavy and she has trouble pushing it with her nose when it gets stuck in a corner or behind an obstacle . I would not buy aother one of these . I wish it was a lighter weight material	-1
I have to say after reading all the glowing reviews and getting a couple of personal recommendations from friends , I 'm disappointed in my purchase here . I bought the 10-inch push-n-play for our 60 lb . 10-month old Olde English Bulldogge and perhaps this ball is just too large and/or heavy for her , but she has little to no interest in it . True , the ball does appear to be absolutely indestructable , but it 's very heavy and hard as a rock . It weighs about 3-4 lbs and is too heavy for me to pick up and throw overhand - the best I can do is roll awkwardly like a bowling ball and it travels about 10-15 feet ... .and then the only thing our dog does with it is stand over it so you ca n't take it from her . No pushing , no playing , and little to no chasing .	-1
My dog played with the Jolly ball the very first time I threw it , but has had no interest in it since . He does n't seem to like that he ca n't sink his teeth into it or maybe he just does n't like that ca n't destroy it.This jolly ball is just made of hard plastic , there is no give to it and it does n't really bounce . I thinks it 's too hard for him to play with and he 's a 70lb Pitt/lab mix.I was hoping this would replace buying him new basketballs and soccer balls that he eventually pops . I guess I just will have to keep looking for a good ball for my dog .	-1
this is a big ball for my 12 lb schnoodle . Too big I think . It 's like a hard plastic material so , no bounce and he 's not able to grab it also because of the size . I tried just rolling it to him to get him to play with it , but , it just rolled loudly and he just stared at it . I do n't think he ever plays with it .	-1
When I purchased this I did n't understand exactly how hard the ball was . The ball came and the dogs play with it , but not much as all they can do is push it around . We keep the ball in the dog-pool and they like it there . I will not be purchasing more of these as there are other toys that they like better .	-1
Bought this for a mini-Schnauzer who can open his jaws hugely wide and pop even 30 '' playground balls.But this is too heavy for him . He CAN roll it around , but kicking it for him to chase is a sure broken toe , and throwing it invites him to run UNDER it before it lands , and it is heavy enough to squash dog flat.Doggone.Buy this only if you have a very , very large dog , or , better yet , a playful horse .	-1
The advertisement for this product indicated that it would hold up to an aggressive chewer- this ca n't be farther from the truth . I gave it to my Parson Jack Russell and she had the handle chewed off and was able to puncture the rubber in less than 20 minutes- what a rip ! Do not buy this if you have an aggressive chewer- it will not hold up . Too bad she damaged it , or I would send it back- this was money truly WASTED !	-1
My ( now 6mo ) pitbull-mutty-mix loves when I bring this ball out , but she does nothing but play `` keep-away '' with it so she can go off somewhere and chew on the handle . She was able to chomp a chunk of the corner off the handle in no time , so this toy 's a gonner now ... As far as the `` Jolly '' line of toys go , we both really like the Jolly Pet Teaser Ball . My girl goes nuts for it , the plastic is VERY hard so ca n't destroy it -- although , if left to settle down with the ball , she can scrape curls of plastic off of it . That 's when the toy gets put away until next time ...	-1
it took my dog 5 min to tear the top off and an hour to tear the rest of it up .	-1
The only reason it has one star is to get to write the review . I am asking for my money back . My six month old puppy had the handle chewed off in ONE day . It would be in the garbage except I might have to send it back . DO NOT buy unless you want plastic pieces ll over and possibly swallowed by your dog .	-1
This toy started good but within a week , the handle was chewed off . Mind you my dogs are not great chewers but they took care of this like it was candy . Material needs to be tougher for me to consider buying again . Now it is just a 3/4 ball with a big hole .	-1
my big dogs LOVED this . not in a fun playtime way but in a & # 34 ; let 's eat this way. & # 34 ; i had to throw it away.sigh .	-1
My lab loves , loves , loves this toy . We get the 10 inch size for him . He carries it around , bites it , plays soccer with it and tosses it around . The ball has holes all over it but it still keeps it 's shape . We 've owned several of these toys and they last a long time before getting destroyed . Great for outside play , I do n't allow it in the house as he gets too crazy with it and could knock something over , including me.He was able to chew up the handle but the ball stayed inflated . The ball is fine without a handle so I should have just ordered the one without the handle . The entire thing wound up in two pieces eventually , actually lasting us a couple of months . But I can see how really hard chewers would plow through this toy . My dog is not so concerned with chewing this toy up , he likes to mouth it.Now I have noticed that his canine teeth are wearing down much too quickly for his age . I 'm worried that toys like this one , where he will mouth on it for a long time , is a big contributor or even the cause . I am going to ask my vet , but until then I have to be yet another killjoy in his life and take this away . Sorry big guy .	-1
My Malamute immediately started to chew the handle part and ate some pieces so I cut off the handle but she was eating the ball still so we had to throw it away . So it lasted only 10 minutes . This ball is not good for chewers but very fun toy for many other dogs .	-1
I bought this item for my Mastiff/Lab mix to play with outside . Within literally 30 seconds the top was destroyed and it can no longer be picked up , much less tossed around . True my dog can be an aggressive chewer , but he has had some toys for months and although marred up a bit , still in relatively good condition . Can not recommend as a pet toy , it 's too heavy for small dogs and larger dogs will tear it apart .	-1
I had bought this one a couple of years ago but my dog ( 9 months at the time ) immediately chewed off the handle and ignored the ball since he could n't toss it . I ordered this since he is now 4 - thought he would have matured . Ordered a bigger one . He still chewed off the handle and ignored it . He loves to toss and chase . I wish they would make the handle different to where it is not chewable - i would buy it again in an instant . Carter , who is a power chewer , loves the item until he could n't toss anymore . I never thought he would chew it through this thick handle .	-1
I bought this toy thinking it would be understandable ... nope ! ! ! ! The dog started ripping off pieces of the plastic in minutes . This toy maybe lasted a few weeks for us . Because of that I bought the one with no handle . Horrible idea the dog got so frustrated that he could n't pick it up he would just push it in a corner and wine . I just took it away and hid it .	-1
So disappointed in this product . Looked like the dogs were in heaven until the handle was completely chewed off in about 4 minutes . After that they did not bother with it any more . My dogs are really tough on their toys and I am constantly looking for toys that last and keep their interest .	-1
Nope ... this toy lasted less than 5 minutes with my 10 month old labrador and the handle was gone . UGH ! ! !	-1
When we received this ball , I thought we would really like it and for about a half day we thoroughly enjoyed watching our lab nose the ball around , but shortly thereafter we had to take the ball away from her and throw it away . She was nibbling the plastic off around the ball opening . Again , this may be an okay toy if you do n't have a strong chewer , but I would not recommend this ball for labs .	-1
My labrador retriever has n't shown an interest in the 10 '' Jolly Pet Teaser Ball . I have tried to encourage her to play with it but no luck . She does n't have any sort of obsession with balls or playing fetch , one or two throws and she 's done , so possibly it just is n't her thing . It looks fun to me and I can certainly see where some dogs would find it fascinating .	-1
I have an 80 lb Lab/Pit who totally destroyed this . To be fair he is an a power chewer who has also conquered the black Kong toys . This is a great toy for that will probably last for the average dog . Not recommended for a power chewer .	-1
Lasted about 4 hrs . And the next morning the dog through up chunks of plastic . Not For a dog who chews . The holes give a place for mouth hold to start chewing up .	-1
I just bought this ball 4 days ago with a combination of 5 toys . Our German Shepherd does like to carry the Teaser Ball around , but he does not roll it around like he does with the other balls . He 's already chewed around the edges ONLY by carrying the ball . Today I noticed the jagged edges are sharp , they scratched a section of our floor and I 'm worried it 's going to cut either him or us before long . So though I wanted him to have this big ball toy , it 's already being taken away . He did NOT chew on the ball , he did n't have access to the ball when he was n't supervised . The & # 34 ; chew & # 34 ; marks are simply by the way he picks up the ball in his teeth and carries it around.I 'm sticking with the Crink-It and the Orka Jack as his most treasured toys !	-1
This ball has a great concept but my dog does not care for it since the outer portion is hard plastic . I also do not feel it is worth 20 dollars .	-1
My mastiff had this destroyed in less than 1 minute after it was taken out of package . Would not buy again .	-1
We had this toy for approximately one afternoon before my 10lb . pug was able to eat the stuffing from the neck . The head portion did not seem to be sufficiently stitched tight and sturdy for dog chewing .	-1
Our 7 month old boxer ripped the stuffing out in a week . Good looking toy , but not tough enough for active dogs .	-1
I read other reviews and they said the dish is large . I should have paid real attention . This dish is good if your cat is a Mountain Lion . It is VERY misleading to have it come up in a Search for Cat items . I am really disappointed because in the appropriate size it would have really filled an important need .	-1
I bought this for my outdoor semi-feral cat . It is super wide and deep , not good for small dogs or cats . I modified it the best I could for smaller dishes to fit inside , but it is not easy to work with being so deep . The moat is very deep and wide so food gets dropped in it all the time which causes a mess , odor and bacterial issues . I have also noticed that this bowl creates a `` shelter '' of sorts for crickets and other critters to live underneath it . It does keep the ants out , but could be so much better . The open moat design causes a lot of problems . This would be okay for a large pet that does n't make a mess when eating -- sticks their head in and does n't come back out until they are done . Shopping for a different design , wo n't be using this one anymore .	-1
I bought this toy more than two years ago adn it 's still in pristine condition . Neither of my two cats shows the least interest in it .	-1
The product is great , but the description was WRONG . My cat goes through these things like it 's his job . Unfortunately , I was very disappointed when I only received one replacement pad instead of two . I more than likely will not order from this seller again . Trusting the description the seller is one of the top components that help me decide if I want to order an item or not . Although my cat loves the Bergan Scratcher I do n't know if I 'll buy the replacement pads from the same seller again .	-1
Really surprised at the too high price for these at Amazon - should be about half this price . Shop around and you can get them cheaper.And I am a daily & long-term Amazon shopper ...	-1
I should 've heeded the warning of the other reviews here , My 10 pound dog is not a very powerful chewer , so I figured it would be ok. For instance , she does n't bite on a Kong , she tosses it up so it falls on the ground and the treats inside get knocked out . Though she clearly enjoyed playing with it , I 'm disappointed that this soccer ball lasted all of 2 nights . The seams are sewed together with a single strand of thin thread , the kind I use to sew buttons on clothes . She easily ripped one of the seams then proceeded to pull most of the stuffing out . Oh well , lesson learned	-1
Beware : if you 're ordering this product for a soccer ( proper football ) lover , you may not get a soccer ball . I received a red and white pseudo-basketball . The tag said `` soccer ball '' too so the manufacturer is clearly not an athlete/sportsman.At $ 4 , I did n't bother returning it , but be forewarned : you may not receive a soccer ball !	-1
Not 4 & # 34 ; good for a small dog . This is a typical stuffed ball for a small dog . My lab could swallow this	-1
These balls are usually pretty good , and all my dogs love them . Unfortunately , this particular version , the soccer ball , has too many seams , and the seems are not too strong . Holes appear all the time . I 'd avoid this one . The basketball and the football are much better . Size-wise , I like this type of ball though . A large breed puppy can grab them , and an adult dog ca n't swallow them - that part is great . But , again , stay away from the soccer version .	-1
These bowls are too big for our puppy . They seem durable thought . The problem I had with them was peeling the stickers off . They were places on the inside of the bowl and one removed they left sticker pieces all over the bottom of the dish .	-1
UPDATE 04/17/14 : as previously stated , I 've been a little worried about using this metal dish ... does n't seem like stainless to me . today , I washed it again and decided to give it a try . I put my kitty 's regular food in it , and he did n't seem interested but did , later , eat some ( after being coaxed by me ) . awhile , later , I noticed he thrown up ( not hair ball either ! ) . i 'm not sure if this is just coincidence or not , but it 's too much coincidence for me ! he does n't usually throw up , especially light yellow-looking fluid with a little food mixed in ! I immediately , dumped the food and went back to using his regular bowls from my own set of dishes . i 'm on the lookout again , searching for the best cat dish . I do n't think i 'll be looking in the `` pet supplies '' section , tho . i 'm deducting another star because i 'm sure this is n't a quality feeding bowl , and now I do n't believe it to be safe . there should have been no reason for my cat to throw up like that , except for this pet bowl.ORIGINAL REVIEW : I just do n't know what to think about this pet dish . My immediate impression was bad , but , after further inspection , i 'm warming to it with reservations . it seems extremely light weight and does n't `` feel '' like real stainless steel , but I hope i 'm wrong . I guess time will tell . one good thing ... the product label says `` made in india , '' so , at least , it 's did n't come from china . we 're going to give it a try and see what happens ... see how my cat likes it , how it washes , if it discolors , chips , or rusts , etcetera . if it does work out , the price is such that I might buy a few more . anyway , i 'm hoping for the best ! right now , i 'll just be happy to have one of my cereal/salad bowls from my own set of dishes back ... kitty knocked one off the table and broke it , so i 'm already short one bowl in my set ! it 's been so hard to find the right cat-feeding dishes ... most have the straight , high , sharp-angled sides . manufacturers just do n't seem to `` get it '' about what kind of dish cats prefer eating from , and i 'm so tired of tossing canned food that has dried because it 's been left stuck in the sharp angles . btw , the label was very easy to remove from the dry dish ( do n't wet it first ) , and the label reads : `` SPOT , Diner Time , STAINLESS STEEL , Pet Dish tm , c 2011 Ethical Products , Inc. , Bloomfield , NJ 07003 , Made in India . '' i 'm really hoping this dish works out , as i 'm so tired of constantly being on the look out for cat dishes that both kitty and I can live with . as usual , if I later find this product worse or better than my current take on it , i 'll return with an update , possibly changing the rating and explain why .	-1
The rubber ring is very difficult to put back on after washing . And the bowl itself is made of very thin , cheap material .	-1
I was looking for an All Glass brand aquarium hood light , and in seeing it shown as an ALL GLASS co. hood , I ordered it from the Amazon Marketplace . Upon receiving my parcel , it was an Aqueon brand light . Aqueon has apparently taken over the All Glass company and is selling its inferior quality hoods as `` All Glass brand hoods '' . I have used an All Glass for over 15 years on one of my tanks and it still works perfectly . ( It 's the kind with the push button switch/ballast ) . What you get now is the Aqueon brand hood light , which lasts approximately a year and then burns up your tube lights -- and then fails completely . I 've been through that before and wanted to avoid another wasted venture . This was my e-mail reply from AllPet after explaining the situation and requesting a refund : `` Thank you for your order . All Glass is Aqueon . The company changed its name '' . What terrific customer service.Update 4/29/13 : I just received an e-mail stating that my return request from AllPet has now been officially closed . It said , `` Reason : your technical issue has been resolved '' . In other words , when a thief steals your money , then your technical issue has been resolved ? So , in review of the whole fiasco , this is what is going on : `` ALL GLASS '' brand lights -- which are amazingly still being shown in the photo and listing here -- are no longer being manufactured . You will receive an inferior quality Aqueon light instead ( made of totally different electrical components and not what you ordered ) . I 'm disappointed to see Amazon continuing to run this listing as it is -- because it 's false . Enough said.Update 7-8-13 : I was browsing through my reviews and decided to check in here and see what 's up . I noticed that there is unfortunately another customer who just threw his money away like I did . It is n't really Amazon 's fault , because legally , Aqueon does own the All Glass company now , and can call these hoods `` ALL GLASS '' brand products . The catch here is that these hoods perform for about a year ( if you 're lucky ) and then will burn up the light bulb , due to the inferior electronics inside -- and then completely fail . So , in summary , these are disposable hood lights and you 'll be shopping for another one soon enough . It 's like ordering yourself a Porsche , and then when the transport truck arrives , surprise ! , ... .you have just been sent a Yugo . Since Amazon is a super good company -- and has saved me hundreds of dollars over the years -- I 'm gon na just swallow this down . I do feel that the product listing picture here should show the AQUEON box though , 'cause that 's what you 're getting . Man , do I miss the original ALL GLASS company -- they were committed to making high quality aquarium accessories . OK , enough whining by me . Live and learn , right ?	-1
Item arrived damaged , had no protection in the original box .	-1
I waited for this delivery for 3 days now even though it is under Prime shipping . I was so excited to get it but when I tried to take it out of the box I could n't even look at it at all or see what it looked like because it was shattered in pieces . I 'm not blaming Amazon because I know that UPS and USPS has a way of being extremely careless in their shipping . I am a seller on ebay and a lot of times I am told the boxes I sent are destroyed almost to the point of damaging the item . In some cases the items are destroyed as well . Amazon was great though . I called them and got an immediate refund and was able to order this product again . I am hoping that it arrives safely and in one piece this time .	-1
Bought two of these for my 20 and 30 tall aquariums and the fit OK the long way but front to back seem at least 3/8- 1/2 & # 34 ; short and leave a gap . Maybe I have a different aquarium then they are intended for but how would I know . Made OK if they only fit correctly .	-1
I bought this because this was the only glass top on amazon . I should have went to the hardware store to just pick a piece of glass up . I did n't like this product because it came broken . Also , it has a black tab that connects the two glass pieces . That black tab conveniently blocks the light . I got a glass top so light could go through it , not have a strip of no-light area . The back vinyl piece is also pretty short and does n't reach the back of a 20 gallon long	-1
This product may work well with aqueon products or more of a European curved tank.. Curvature was not even close to fiting older marineland curved tank , also was too narrow . Returned for a full refund , Amazon made it right ,	-1
I thought this would be a good idea for my hamster but he did n't use it . I put droppings in it and even some bedding with pee but he did n't get the idea . Also it was too small for him . ( He 's a syrian ) .	-1
Reasons why I hate this hamster potty:1 . This product with the cover on was not large enough for my smaller sized teddy bear hamster . She looks just like one of the hamsters on the package.2 . She started to eat and play in the litter.3 . She did manage to poop in the box , but not pee , but because she kept eating and playing in the litter she started to smell just like poop -- which she NEVER smelled like this before.4 . It 's ugly and way too colourful like most hamster cages and products.5 . Nearly 7 bucks could have bought me a meal instead.Anyway that is why I hate this stupid hamster potty . It does n't seem healthy for my hamster to be eating and playing in the litter . She looks and smells cleaner just doing her business in the paper bedding material that I use . This was a waste of money and even if it worked would continue to be because not only would one need to buy bedding that needs to be changed weekly , but now clay hamster litter . Clay litter for cats is controversial for their health and landfills and all hamster enthusiasts know that hamsters have very sensitive lungs . I would not recommend this product .	-1
Not sure it 's fair to give one star being that it 's not marketed for a bird , but in addition to the fact that the bettering cracks in it were way to big for animal nails , it was just cheaply made and hard to get the lid on and off . Cost more to ship it back than it cost so I the it away . If invest more for a better made one with a safer breathing system than three cracks on this one	-1
I remember these balls from when I was a kid . Seems the plastic is super cheap , and that the lid does n't always go on just right . This particular one had shards of plastic sticking out from the lid so it does n't close all the way . Took some finagling , but I managed to make it work . I understand it 's only $ 10 , but it should n't need to be sanded down , or taped shut to ensure the safety of your little critter . I bought another one , another brand in another store , so that we could have two . It 's not too much better but at least I did n't have to file it down to make it work .	-1
I purchased this as an exercise toy for our Djungarian dwarf hamster and though it is a little bit large for her , it would have been great if the top did not come off so easily . It was a good thing I was watching her roll around in it the other day when the top came off and she ran right out ! This is obviously a cheap and flimsy plastic ball and I guess I will have to look around for a better quality one .	-1
Agreed- Amazon should not be marketing this for Guineas . I do n't care what the packaging says , it is being marketed to the wrong owners who may not know any better .	-1
Hopefully Amazon will change the title or pull this off eventually . Guinea pigs are not supposed to be in running balls and can injure themselves severely if put in one .	-1
I have loved amazon and I think it is a good web-site but I am very mad at them , ( like the other reviewers ) , for putting this on market ! ! This will hurt your piggy , cause them permanent damage and in a severe case could kill them ! DO NOT BUY THIS FOR YOUR PIGGY ! I think anyone who buys this should be put down for animal abuse ! ! !	-1
Guinea pigs ' spines do not bend like this . They should never ever run in a wheel or exercise ball . Super Pet needs to stop marketing these for guinea pigs , as they are responsible for hundreds of injuries each year . I 'm sure they 're great for other animals , but not guinea pigs .	-1
As many others have already said in their reviews of this product on Amazon.com and elsewhere , the Giant Run-About Exercise Ball is inappropriate for guinea pigs . Despite concerns by guinea pig owners , though , Super Pet continues to market the product on their website as follows : `` 13 inch diameter is ideal for pet rats , guinea pigs , chinchillas or other small animals . It makes a great roly-poly toy for ferrets and a neat pet carrier for guinea pigs . `` Pet owners may wish to contact the manufacturer and ask that the 'Giant Exercise Ball ' be re-labeled to exclude guinea pigs from the product description and advertising : customerservice @ superpet.net	-1
Chinchillas get way too hot way too easily , the lack of ventilation could kill them ! This is not suitable for chinchillas .	-1
First off , as others have reviewed and stated about guinea pigs , chinchillas ' spines are not made for this type of activity . Buy them a COVERED playpen , or leave them in their chinchilla-appropriate cages . They have fun wherever they are . Chichillas really do n't care where they are , as long as they have walls to bounce off of and wooden toys to destroy . Anyone who has done ANY research into the temperature control needed by chinchillas to survive ( hello- they wear a fur coat all year . Their fur is made up of approx . 80 strands of hair per hair follicle . That 's a really thick fur coat to be wearing all day , all year round . ) would realize that furry little critters enclosed in a plastic ball with very small slits for air equals an animal that is going to overheat if left in there for more than 10 minutes . Speaking of the slits in the ball ; they are the PERFECT size for itty bitty cute little chinchilla toes to get caught and SMASHED in . Let us not forget , ( yeah I 'm talking to the person who said this was mess free playtime ) that while your little guy is running around , getting all nice and overheated , risking his toes being ripped off with every step , that CHINCHILLAS POOP CONSTANTLY . They like to pee quite a bit , too . So while all of this is going on , your chinchilla is now also running in his own feces and urine . What goes up.. must come down.. Being in an enclosed ball with the feces and urine while the ball is in motion puts aforementioned waste into your chinchillas fur , and possibly even their eyes and nasal cavity . Maybe a vet visit would be fun ( after cleaning your overheated and pee covered chinchilla ) for eye infections or URI ? SOUNDS LIKE FUN , RIGHT ? So , I guess if you , as a consumer are okay with all of the above and STILL think it is a good idea.. I want you to ask yourself `` When has a large corporation ever had my or my pets best interest at heart ? '' and think about how much money you may end up spending , trying to save your animals life after using one of these things . Maybe then you will agree it 's not the right thing to do for your fur-baby .	-1
You will harm your guinea if you buy this for them . They are not a gerbil or hamster and their backs are not made for this . i ca n't believe AMAZON is marketing this ball for them . Any pet store who knows anything about these animals will tell you not to purchase a ball for them . I love amazon , but they are putting guinea pigs at risk by leaving this on their site . SHAME ON THEM ! ! You can see the packaging clearly has a RAT on it , not a guinea ! !	-1
We 've owned several wheels and this one by far is the loudest . It 's so distracting that we had to move Zoe out of the TV room .	-1
This is the perfect size wheel for my hamster , but the first wheel broke after 3 months , and the second one broke after three DAYS . In the market for another one now..	-1
We tried this wheel that is slightly bigger diameter than the silent spinner since gerbils are a little bigger than hamsters , but our gerbils prefer the silent spinner - they would n't use the comfort wheel nearly as often . We also tried the Flying Saucer , but our gerbils could not figure that one out . Also , the silent spinner wheel turn noises are definitely quieter than the comfort wheel . I would recommend the Silent Spinner wheel instead .	-1
Add me to the list of people who got one that does not spin . Wish I could find this size locally so I could test them until I found one that works . Apparently they have a very high rate of DOA .	-1
This is so noisy it drives me crazy , it is 4 AM and we hear this ruckus ... .. But I wo n't deny , my hamsterella seems to love it and it is gentle on her feet because it is plastic but it is still noisy . We live in a studio apt . so it is a problem but if she does n't share room with you then it probably would n't be a problem .	-1
I was very surprised that so many people gave this wheel a positive review . Of all the wheels I have owned , and that is many , this is by far the worst yet . First off , the wheel is full of harsh edges and corners that I am not entirely comfortable with my animal running in . The wheel sort of just sits on the rack , with no kind of clicking , screwing , or attachment.My wheel came bent , and while I could blame the seller for the broken wheel , I also have to nod to the incredibly poor workmanship that is the wheel . The entire side of the wheel was `` crushed in '' . As I tried to bend it back , I could feel the strain and how easy this will break with just a bending or two.I am not sure what everyone else uses this wheel for , but I have owned chinchilla 's and I do not see this working for any but perhaps baby chinchilla 's . It is all metal , which chinchilla 's will need due to their tendency to chew everything , but this still would n't be the preferred wheel for them.The only species I think this wheel would work well for are rats . So if you have a rat , then this might be a decent wheel for them.However , it is a cheap wheel , and I am considering returning it , because frankly , it arrived bent badly . I had to bend it alot just to get the wheel to fit on the spokes , which , as I said , offer no kind of attachment , so the wheel kind of just sits on spokes . The aggressive running of a chinchilla I could easily see ripping the wheel right off the spokes , since there is nothing keeping it on anyway .	-1
We have have had pet rats for 12 years and I always have exercise wheels for them . I bought this wheel a year ago , to have as a second wheel , and one of my rats injured her tail in it . I took her to the vet and the vet informed me that this type of & # 34 ; wire wheel & # 34 ; is not appropriate for rats because their tails can get caught and injured , which is what happened to mine . I ca n't speak for any other small critters , only rats .	-1
my pet chinchillas love to run on the wheels we have but the problem is these wheels are not made well . the metal breaks and hurts the chinchillas so owners MUST KEEP CHECKING to make sure chinchillas are not HURTING .	-1
Wire mesh + crazy running chinchilla = broken toes ( or worse ) The mesh of this is perfect for little toes to get caught in . If a foot gets caught while the wheel is moving , the chin could be very seriously injured , including sprained or broken feet or legs . You ca n't pin a broken chinchilla leg , so that means an amputation . Is your chinchilla 's leg ( and your hard earned money being wasted ) worth saving a few bucks by buying this instead of a quality metal wheel that can be found online elsewhere ? I do n't think so . If people want to use these for other animals , go for it ( I 've never owned any other rodents or rodent-like creatures besides chinchillas , so I ca n't speak on the safety for rats , degus , etc . ) but they need to stop marketing this to chinchilla owners .	-1
my bunny broke it two days later to it 's arrival . Too light fro him , he brakes things while playing around .	-1
Light green and a somewhat dark blue were the colors I received of the two ordered . The design of the guinea pigs was a lot more detailed and not as nice as the simple ones shown in the images , but I guess that 's preference . The main problem with these bowls is that they 're easily pulled over by guinea pigs . That leaves a mess and dust on the floor of the cage .	-1
THe picture is very deceiving . IT looks comfortable and it looks like there is fleece lining on both sides of the hammock , but it turns out , theres only a piece of material ( would n't even call it fleece ) on one side , and its not a comfortable feeling at all . I put it in my cage and my 2 guinea pigs started chewing on it , but would n't go on it . I put one of them in it , and he hated it . Jumped right offI ca n't return it either so ... Im stuck with it , somewhere in my drawer	-1
Trying to please the cat , I hung this hammock in the cage I have attached to the outside of my house ( accessible through a kitty door ) . The next day I happened to look out and saw the cat in a horrid position : one of his legs had gotten caught in the straps , and trying to get out , he had totally twisted the hammock with his leg jammed in a painful angle . I was able to retrieve him ( without getting bitten or scratched ) , but if I had n't seen it right away , this would have resulted in several hundred dollars worth of vet bills , and maybe even a dead cat .	-1
I was really disappointed by this . There is no fleece liner in the bottom of this and it 's very cheaply made . My rat 's had it destroyed in a matter of minuets . They would n't even use it to sleep in.. even after it was lined with a fleece blanket I bought myslef for them .	-1
Too thin material for this type of item . This hammock lasted only a couple of months before tears started in the center of the hammock . Clips were of very cheap material as well . Will not purchase again .	-1
I loved the idea of this , as our guinea pig loves to look out of her cage . The problem was that she was afraid of it , and did n't seem to understand the concept of backing up . We had a hard time getting her out of it , and we tried many different positions.In my opinion , do n't buy this unless you are planning on trying it for your ferret ! ! !	-1
I did not care for this item , it fell apart after one week of having it . My little ferret tore it apart in no time	-1
I was excited to get this for my ratties , but once I opened it up , I realized it was way too big for their cage . It 's about a foot and a half long , and does n't stay open like it looks in the picture . I also got an ugly , dull blue color . If there were an option to choose the color and length , I might be more happy with my purchase .	-1
This came in a totally different color what advertised and the fabric was thin and cheap . I have fleece lining the inside to make it a little more comfy and yet my rats dont even use it !	-1
The one I got was maroon and black ( which I really did n't mind ) and my two ferrets tore it apart in just a couple weeks . They did LOVE to sleep and play in it though . I just wish it lasted longer . Would be a great product , but I 'd recommend something more durable .	-1
didnt hook onto my cage so it kept getting knocked over and litter got everywhere , which is a pain to clean up / :	-1
While this pan might be good for a younger ferret , it 's much to small for any of my full- grown ferrets toget all 4 feet into.The hooks do not work with my cage , so my ferrets just push it around.Even though these are cheaper , I 'll stick with square lock- on pans .	-1
This litterpan is too big . It takes up too much room in teh lage-i was ent teh largew litter pan . I ended up using it to hold my open bags of Piggie food .	-1
It 's nice but it came without a corner clip . I would like them to send me the clip that is missing .	-1
Sigh ... I had high hopes for this , but the first night I brought it home my rabbit chewed through the mesh neck in a matter of minutes . I suppose it ought to be made out of something sturdier than mesh .	-1
1 . These should never be for guineas . It makes their back arch in a way that is n't natural2 . My Lionhead rabbit got out , ran across my yard and almost escaped into the neighbors back yard with the beagles .	-1
Maybe I should have put my smaller male in this and the larger male in the regular one , but this lasted two walks . Ferrets love walks ! ! ! And I have a boy who will walk as far as you let him . This how ever lasted two walks only before it ripped and became unusable .	-1
I have a 2 year old ferret and this harness was way too big . I put it on him to go to a local pet festival and he got out of it in less than 5 minutes and i had it cinched all the way up . No good	-1
It is a very nice little carrier visually , looks well made and has plenty of room for any animal the size of a ferret . The problem is that within five min of being in the carrier my ferret had ripped one of the window vents and was escaping from the carrier . Could have been a disaster as I was in the car at the time by myself and the little guy could have found himself in many not to safe places . Fortunately I had a box with me so I stuck him in that . I had to turn around from my trip and find a better container to transport him in . The damage to the container is reparable , I could sew it up , but he will just rip through it next time he is in it . I was really disappointed because this carrier was just perfect for my needs . If you have a less active animal these will probably be great , but not for a curious one who really does not want to be confined .	-1
I bought this for my ferret because it said this was the size for it . I put my baby in it and started driving . Within a mile i felt something by my feet . My ferret ( 2years old ) had ripped through the mesh panel ( it is only connected by a little bit ) and was around my feet . I am lucky i didnt have an accident . Will not reccomend this product to anyone with a ferret	-1
Bought this product thinking it would be large enough for an adult cat and also because I liked the grooved sides I saw in the picture . ( Figured they might be easier to clean than regular flat sides ) But when it arrived , it was much smaller than I thought it was and did n't have any grooves in it at all . Instead it looked like just a basic litter pan . It was also incredibly expensive for what it was . I easily found cheaper products in local stores . Thought I was saving myself some money and time by getting this , but I ended up returning it . Give it a pass unless you have a small animal using this , like a kitten or maybe a rabbit .	-1
I guess if you have a kitten or a very very very small cat that this box would work fine ; however , my cats weigh 9 pounds each and this box is way too small for them .	-1
I received a LARGE litter pan with a SMALL label ! Turned out I kept it since it was an add'on and would cost more to ship back . Plus its actually fortuitous because my bunnies love it , and I 've replaced the much smaller one I had for them , which always seemed a tad small . This is a tad large , but the big guy took to it quickly ! Go figure .	-1
When I bought this the description was accurate , but I was going off of the photo when I ordered it . The photo showed ( and still does a couple months later ) a Pureness High Sides pan , which is what I wanted . Instead they sent a & # 34 ; large & # 34 ; pan that was pretty dang small for any but the smallest of cats . But , Amazon gave me a prompt refund . They just need to fix the photo !	-1
I have four cats , including two large males who like to pee standing up while looking out the front ( had to remove the flap early on or my oldest would n't use it at all ) . I was hoping this litter pan with its tall bottom would work to contain their efforts , but not so . They manage to aim halfway up the inside of the lid when in it . I wished covered litter boxes were designed so that liquid runs back into the box rather than seeping out of it when sprayed above the seams . The problem with this box is that the pee runs down the inside of the lid , finds its way through the crack between the lid and bottom pan , and continues running down on the outside , collecting on the floor behind the litter box . For a while , I placed puppy pee pads under the back end of the litter box to catch the `` overflow '' and had to change them almost on a daily basis . I finally gave up on it and removed the box in favor of a `` custom-designed '' large plastic storage bin with cutout . I 'm sure it would have worked reasonably well for my other two cats , but was just getting too messy with the two that like to pee standing up .	-1
One of my cats pees against the sides and apparently the rim collects urine and leaks . I did n't notice this for a long time and my carpet was collecting the pee . I cleaned the carpet as best I could but it has been permanently stained yellow . : -/	-1
Inconvenient clumped litter removal with cover is the main reason I do n't care for this concept . My cats also did n't find the box to their liking . I now use a high sided litter box so I can easily see , if not smell , when cleaning must be done . I see no reason for this type of box except perhaps for travel in a mobile RV .	-1
Too flimsy . Returned with absolutely no hassle	-1
I have several cats and hoped this would ease my workload but I did n't even attempt to put it together , it is so flimsy . I 'd hoped , after trying one I 'd order several more for my Kitty Rescue Ranch . Other reviews mention its delicate locks , or tabs that keep lid and bottom together and I figured I could handle it with ease but this pan is so cheap it insults my intelligence . I put it right back into the box and sent it back . PLUS , its method of 'rolling the clumps to the side into a tray ' makes no sense to me . There are still clumps that stick to the bottom of the pan that must be dealt with . If anyone ignores this fact , and makes their kitty go on soiled litter I am sorry for the cat . At least one review said they dump it only once a week ... ? ? ? I miss made in USA products ! !	-1
It 's supposed to be & # 34 ; Litter Scoop Free Maintenance. & # 34 ; It is n't . It 's only slightly larger than a & # 34 ; regular size & # 34 ; litter box and does not have a sifting screen . It 's more like a covered dishpan . Worthless .	-1
I ordered this product thinking it would make cleaning my kittens litter box easier . I have been using a covered litter box . Well I was wrong . This litter box is one big mess . Everything gets stuck in the sifting part and you end up having to wash it out with the hose . My kitten also did not like the sifting part on his feet so started going # 2 by the walls instead of the litter . I ended up throwing this in the trash ! I went back to a covered litter box and have no problems now . I do not recommend this product it is a big waste of money and a mess !	-1
We bought the large sifting box , the nicest one ( with lid ) . Did not work for our 2 cats.We used extra-clumping litter , as instructed ( that 's the kind we use anyway ) , but the clumps of pee get stuck on the sifter.The `` hard '' waste sifts out just fine . But the pee causes a huge gummy mess . It 's too big & gets stuck on the sifter . Then I had to spend several minutes , each time , shaking & scrubbing the sifter pan into the trash bag . And ( hate to be overly descriptive here ) if your cat ever has diarrhea , the sifter will get ~really~ messy.I then bought a kitchen scrubber to scrape off the residue each time . I 'm laughing , in retrospect , as to how much effort I put into this - I really wanted this to work . I can imagine if you only have one ( small ) cat who only pees small bits at a time , it may work better.Tried feline pine & also crystals . Successfully sifted out the poop , but the urine just goes straight to the bottom , which *never* gets sifted out . It starts smelling quickly , & you have to manually clean the box.Then , the box has fallen apart on me `` twice '' while trying to move it - the plastic latches pop off easily . Made a huge mess all over the floor.Then one day I decided this was much more work than my old basic litter box . This is a great idea , wish it worked.If anyone knows of a better product or method , please leave a comment . For auto-sifting , so far I 've found the liner bags work better than just about anything . I 've also tried toilet training , but the smaller cat jumps into the toilet to give himself a bath if the toilet lid is left open ( he loves to swim - we ca n't stop him from jumping in the tub or shower with us . Yeah , I 've got some crazy cats . We love them . )	-1
The door on the litter box gets stuck inside the box , trapping your cat inside.Avoid this product .	-1
I give my dog 1/2 cup of food in the morning and 1/2 cup of food in the afternoon . At first I was using a normal 1/2 cup measuring scoop . I ended up ordering this scoop when I purchased a new food container . It has markings for 1 cup as well as 1/2 of a cup.I started using this for a few days and noticed my dog food bowl had a lot more food in it then normal . So I went back my old measuring scoop , filled it up and poured it into the new scoop . It did not fully fill to the 1/2 measurement mark . Then I did the reverse , I filled up the new scoop and poured it into the old scoop and it overflowed.I did n't bother testing to see if 1 cup was accurate but definitely the 1/2 cup is n't accurate .	-1
Do n't like it , but then look at the cost . Mine was n't even white . It is blue and I put it in a large bag of dog food . There are markings ever so slight for 1/2 cup and 1 cup which are not of much use - use a measuring cup instead.It 's my fault , I should have shopped more carefully to find what I needed , which was a small 1 cup scoop that I could use instead of one of my nice kitchen ones . It 's flimsy and has rough edges .	-1
I had bought this along with a scratch mat from target to put catnip inside . The catnip that came with the target mat drove my cat crazy ! She absolutely loved it . However , when that wore off I tried this cosmo catnip and ... absolutely nothing . Obviously some catnip works for my cat , so I do n't get why this stuff had no effect at all . I 'm not sure if it is my cat , but now I have a whole tub of this stuff and she is completely unimpressed . It might be worth a shot for others though .	-1
if your looking for a silk plant look elsewhere , nothing but cheep plastic . I put this in my tank and it will not even stand upright , just lays on the bottom as the stem will not support this POS	-1
The teeth seem too close together . I followed their instructions and got the supposedly correct comb , but does not work . I think that the furminator picks up fleas just as well .	-1
I like the feel of it , but it does nothing for my dogs ... .the fleas seem to escape this comb every time	-1
A black colored comb does n't allow you to see those quick , sneaky fleas on the comb ! I find this comb useless ! The comb needs to be a light color in order to see the fleas . Buy a different flea comb with a light silver comb on it if you want to find and remove fleas on your pet . Do n't buy this comb , I plan to return mine !	-1
We have two pitbull/rhodesian ridgeback mixes . This did not work for them at all . It did not remove any hair . It was good for removing clumped-on dirt , but that was it . I returned it for a comb that works much better .	-1
So I got this for my cockatiel because I have a smaller one for my parakeet and he loves it . Little did I know that she would get her beak caught in the little loop that the hook to hang it is attached to , break her bottom beak off , and have to go to the vet every 2 weeks for 3 months to try and repair it , which did n't work by the way . Her beak will now never grow back thanks to the amount of space inside that little loop , and she can only eat on one side of her mouth . If it was plied shut more or smaller , she never would have gotten it caught . So thanks to this toy that I got for cheaper than it is now , I now have a deformed cockatiel who will never be normal again.If you do still get it , please be sure to ply the loop yourself so there is no space in between just to be safe .	-1
These do not work . They are dull and would n't cut butter . In the long run , it 's better to save your money and buy more expensive ones .	-1
These scissors have no sharpness and are a waste of money . Spend more and buy a better pair . They are n't worth the savings in the long run	-1
The scissor are not as sharp as I expected.. I had to continue cutting more than once to thin it out	-1
When I bought these I did n't realize that only one blade had teeth , and I must admit , I 'm not very knowledgeable about thinning shears . However , I doubt these could cut butter . They are pretty much useless to me , but like I said , could be user error . I did purchase another pair that seem to work well . So . Either you get what you pay for , or one bladed thinning shears have a particular use - and I do n't know what it is . I do know I would never purchase this item again !	-1
I smell no difference in my dogs when I spray them with this they still smell like dogs . I was hoping it would help with my dog 's skunk encounter but it made no difference at all .	-1
My sister is allergic to dogs but not severely . I tired using this dander remover 3 times and she still had problems . For the amount of money plus shipping that this solution costs , I would expect to have better results ! Do n't wast your money !	-1
I am sure this must work for some but for me my kitty kept revisiting the oops . I 've tried many of these type products and the only one I have ever found that completely took out the odor was a product called What Odor ? . I have been using that product for going on 4 years now and have not had one instance of revisiting any oops .	-1
I purchased a gallon of this stuff upon a recommendation from a pet store employee . Sure enough when my puppy had his first accident I ran for the Nature 's Miracle.It helped but it did n't solve the problem . In fact , it made the stain yellow and it smelled like a bottle of rubbing alcohol . This happened time and again with future stains.Out of frustration I went back to the pet store and purchaed their second best seller , Simple Solution . That actually worked and it even removed the yellowing that Nature 's Miracle caused.The Simple Solution was less expensive , smelled better and most importantly it worked ! Nature 's Miracle does n't live up to its name .	-1
One of my cats seems to eat way too fast ( like a vacuum ) and regurgitates from time to time . We live in an apartment that has carpeting , so it 's important to get all the mess cleaned up as the carpet could potentially act as a sponge . This product does n't really offer much in the way of cleaning carpet messes . I ended up using another product I already had that has a bit of a shampooing effect where I can see some sudsing . I guess when I use Nature 's Miracle , I have n't felt confident that it truly cleaned the mess . Perhaps if I were dealing with urine , it would be a different story ? Also , I did not like that the bottle does not have a mister/sprayer . I bought a cheap travel spray bottle to apply this product .	-1
We bought this , thinking that it would help our little shih tzu keep his own teeth clean . Needless to say , he 's not the least bit interested in it . After several failed attempts to garner interest the old fashioned way ( playing with it ourselves ) , we tried a little trick that helped with another hard chew-toy of his : put a little bit of peanut butter on it . After the PB was gone , interest dropped to zero again .	-1
I guess I 'm in the minority . I had heard that these were a problem and shrugged off the warning as one from the few malcontents having a bad day and bought this puppy set . Good chewing BUT ... ..they made my dog sick and he barfed five times . And guess what came up ? And , yes , the sharp little edges were still there . No more nylabone products for me . mb	-1
I got these bones so she could have something to chew on without killing her baby ( toy raccoon ) on a frequent basis . She hardly gives this thing a second look . I pretended to be excited by it . I even pretended I was eating it so she 'd want it but it was a no go . I then tried the never faulty peanut butter trick -- I put a thin layer of peanut butter on it thinking once she 'd get started she 'd love it and not want to stop . She licked off all the peanut butter and walked away . So far it still just lays there . She refuses to touch it . What an utter waste of my hard-earned money.EDIT : 3-8-13My dog has recently managed to lose all of her tennis balls . She is now left with only the bone to play with . She does use this now until she has other toys to play with and then it gets ignored again . I would upgrade my rating to a 3 star .	-1
We bought these hoping our pup would chew on them , ... He chewed on them for a few minutes and now they are just lying around ... He does not seem to like them..	-1

I do n't have an incredibly fragile dog . He is a jack russell terrier . Huge teeth for hunting . Heavy chewer . He would chew on these hours at end and one day I discovers his incisor tooth was cracked and a week later it fell off completely . Now I have to put my little angel in surgery to remove it before it rots and may cause a gum infection ... .	-1
These have been thrown out for good . At first I liked that these kept their teeth busy . My dogs would chew on them endlessly , but then I realized something . I REALLY did n't like that fact that they do ingest the small pieces as they are chewed off . Think of a kid chewing on a plastic toy and the tiny bits coming out into their mouth ( like the size of the rubber bits that are sitting on a piece of paper after erasing something written in pencil ) . Even though the company claims that it 's safe for them to ingest these pieces as far as choking-risks go , I disagree with the implication that these are & # 34 ; safe & # 34 ; overall . Even if they do n't choke on the small bits , the plastic can not be good for them to be ingesting . We would n't let them eat plastic ... so why let them chew a toy that allows them to ingest the toxic plastic as they chew and swallow the bits ? If you are like other owners out there , myself included , we know it 's not all that good for dogs to even eat or drink out of plastic bowls , causing many owners switch to stainless steel or glass ( or some use ceramic ) . I had been using these for a few months and then my vet discovered that my dogs were n't having a reaction to their food , or anything else I eliminated , but that it was an allergic-type of reaction to PLASTIC . Once we got rid of everything plastic ( a.k.a . these bones since everything else of theirs is glass ) their entire issue was resolved . Another thing to note.. have you ever noticed how pets ( especially cats ) are attracted to toxic BPA plastics ? If you put a non-BPA item in front of them , they wo n't pursue it at all usually . I am not at all saying that is what is in these , I actually have no clue what is or is n't in these bones aside from the fact it is plastic , but it 's still something to think about , just some food for thought . If you love your furball , please give some thought to what you are putting in their mouths.Otherwise if it does n't bother you or if you just plain do n't care , they last about a month with really consistent chewers and will keep them occupied . Hard to keep clean though , the & # 34 ; bits & # 34 ; that are torn up on the ends with use seem to catch a lot of fur and such . Even with handwashing I could n't get everything off . Would n't put the plastic in warm or hot water though..actually their mouths are warm too.. guess whatever might leach out in the water might leach out in their mouths too . I hope the company will tell people what these bones actually consist of . Regardless , these are n't ever coming back here !	-1
if you want your teething puppy to get through a bone really fast , buy this . for me i was looking for something that he would have to chew on for a while so this was not the product for my puppy	-1
The packaging warns to not give this to adult dogs or puppies with adult teeth , and that you need to replace it when pieces larger than a grain of rice break off.Our puppy is n't even 4 months yet , so this `` puppy teething bone '' sounded like the perfect fit . No adult teeth . Before we even got home from the pet store , pieces larger than a grain of rice were breaking off from the ends.Do n't bother .	-1
Puppy not too interested and the bone ended up under the couch and forgotten . I Would not recommend this product .	-1
I purchased this product to provide a variety of options for my teething puppy ( Chocolate Bullador ) , but it failed to serve its purpose . After talking with pet store reps , they are not surprised by the following behavior.My puppy was not destroying anything inside and seemed happy with the toys I provided , or so I thought . I should have known better when he gravitated towards previously used toys because his teeth were not strong enough to destroy . He needed another dog to first break up a knot in a rope or tare the seems on a stuff toy . Then , he could pull out the stuffing . Similarly , he was not destroying my electrical cords or gnawing on furniture or at least there were previously no signs of said behavior because he could not yet . However , he was and continues to try to break of branches , pieces of bark , or pine cones outside . I would be find with this , but small pieces were being swallowed and causing GI issues . So , I bought this product and some durachews in anticipation of future needs . However , he preferred the harder toys to push he teeth against into his gums and ignored this teething chew.That was until a week ago ( now with adult teeth ) when he lost interest in the durachews , gravitating towards this puppybone . On day one , he was gnawing it down and exposing the bristles for the first time . However , on day two he was getting a bit more aggressive and breaking off larger chunks . To avoid a potential emergency visit to the vet , I took the toy away . Unfortunately , I am past the 30 day Nylabone warranty period . So , now , I must watch him constantly like back before he was potty trained cause the teething chews are too soft and the durachews are too hard for his taste.Pro : priceCon : Puppy only liked with permanent teeth	-1

My dogs love toys . I 'm not sure why but they do not like this toy . Nobody plays with it . I believe it is too hard or maybe they do n't like the size or shape . So weird !	-1
I have 3 pups and decided that I would order one of these to see if it would keep them busy . All 3 looked at it , gave it a sniff , and then left it in the same place for a week . I finally just threw it out .	-1
My dog looked at this thing and did n't want anything to do with it . Only after I bought her the bone shaped one she figured out what it was supposed to be . She still prefers the bone shape . She will only play with this if I hold one side and pull against it.This thing needs doggy directions .	-1
My dog likes round rawhides , so I tried this as an alternative . He refused to use it.I 'll be donating it to the local animal rescue group . Hopefully a dog that 's less picky will get some use out of it .	-1
i was astonished that this 'chew toy ' was , simply , a circular chunk of solid plastic ... .if any dog spent any time chewing this 'toy ' the owner will need to shell out some serious moolah for dental work ... ... .such a terrible item to be advertised as a chew toy ... ..	-1
I know these are nylabone and chicken flavor . They will not play with them like a frisbee or chew on them either . Waste of my money . I am always skeptical about nylabone . They have excellent products , it 's just my dogs do not like them .	-1
I have 2 dogs . Neither of them is interested in this toy . They have a basket full of toys that they love using , and this one seems to be too hard/not interesting enough . Shame because they love playing tug of war with their other toys and I thought this would be ideal , but it 's definitely a no-go .	-1
It is basically a very hard plastic ring . Maybe it is better for dogs that are heavy chewers . Anyways , my dogs had zero interest in it .	-1
I ordered this a long time ago and my puppy has never been interested in it at all . With all the other options of chews out there , this one is definitely one that just sits around on the floor . Even my friend 's pit bull came over and never even touched it . There just does n't seem to be anything appealing about it to the dogs . It will last forever ... but that 's because she wo n't touch it ! It makes a decent paperweight , I guess .	-1
My dog liked it but it did n't last at all , and at the same time I was worrying because it 's made of plastic and my dog would just chew it into pieces and swallow them , for small breed puppies might be good , but my small breed adult dog can easily break it .	-1
I initially started my dog off on these as the gummy version was too easy for her to tear apart . A few months later during my vet visit , she noticed my dog had two slab fractures on her molars . Granted , my dog would tear into these , but now she has ruined her teeth and requires a crown for both molars . I now use kongs with treats that I replace once they start to look worn .	-1
I disliked the way this chew splintered and ripped up my dog 's mouth as he chewed on it . my dog had extreme digestive distress every time he chewed this bone . I ended up throwing it out because it was n't worth the risk .	-1
I bought two of these for our two dogs . They do n't like them and have not even chewed on them at all since I got them for Christmas .	-1
I got this for my pup . He is a bog pup so i was looking for a larger bone for him . I got excited about this . When it came it was so small . He didnt get go for it . Waste of money . It just lies ont he floor .	-1

Also , these are rock hard and liable to crack teeth . mb	-1
Not sure what kind of flavoring is added - just hope it 's nothing toxic - it 's not very clear on the box , but both of my dogs loved the bones . They 're pretty picky chewers , but once they get to work - they do ... A week into it , and these are just one of many toys they chew on , small parts started falling off from the both ends of the bone and I started finding small bits of white plastic or whatever this is made of on the floor . After a couple of times my dog swallowed it a piece and started coughing , I decided to throw away ... I got 2 of the giant bones , and one was for a 30lbs 8mos old puppy and still was n't in a much better shape than the one taken on by my golden . My golden shredded his much faster . I did heed the warning and give these under supervision only - but they 'd really need to be far sturdier to pass as suitable for moderate to strong chewers ... .	-1
My Pit Bull who loves to chew ... did not pay this any mind.Good thing is that it is not messy and does not smell so I 've kept it around in case she has a change of heart .	-1
My new basset hound ( a rescue ) is extremely active , so thought maybe a bone would give him a way to expend energy . Read reviews , five stars , I guess.When the bone arrived , read the small insert about the products of the company . Indicated that the bone was not for any dog with permanent teeth . Felt cheated . Reviewed the product information . In some one star reviews problems referred to.No problem , since my basset sniffed it once and would have nothing to do with it.Feel it is almost false advertising to not include the `` no dog with permanent teeth '' in product reviews . From the way I read reviews , many happy people were giving the bone to fully grown dogs.All I know is what the included product information says , but , as I say , to omit that from the product information is almost false advertising in my opinion .	-1
Unfortunately , my big chewing dog who goes through a large rawhide bone per day was absolutely not interested in this bone . I tried putting peanut butter on it -- she licked it off . I ended up sending it back and getting the large , black Kong rubber bone that allows you to put treats in either end . She loves it ! Plus , it 's soft enough that it does n't bang on our hardwood floors .	-1
It 's made of a weird material that neither of my boys will go near . It appears that it would be ideal but just does n't work for them..	-1
Nylabone seems to be having an issue with product quality . I hope someone from Nylabone is reading tees reviews and addresses the decline in product quality issues	-1
Bought this for our Big puppy ! She does not like it - too hard to chew on and she is a 'chewer ' and has a large mouth .	-1
My dog is a 9 months old 60 pound boxer and he is a big chewer . We give him antlers , buffalo horns and stuff and they last him about a week to 10 days . Thought I will try this based on the numerous good reviews it has . My dog never liked it . He chewed it for like 10 mins and just rejected it and never tried it again . The problem I think in our case is , this bone is a big piece of plastic and does not ooze out any juice upon chewing . So if your dog is used to chewing traditional bones , do not buy this product . Bottom line is buy this product in the pet store for the first time where return is always hassle free if you dog does n't like it . Buying online and return is a pain now . Now all I have is an expensive piece of plastic laying in my backyard .	-1
I have five big dogs who sniffed tasted and then dropped these 'flavored ' bones . They are n't all that picky . Bummer .	-1
I purchased this toy with hopes that my dogs would love to play with it . Maybe we could toss it around and catch it . I later found out it is not a toy to leave with the `` chewing '' dog . My 100 pound lab/pit bull mix tore off pieces of it . I retrieved the pieces and the frisbee to sit it aside . It is not a toy that can be left around for those dogs with an urge to chew ! It might work for one who likes to play frisbee .	-1
I bought this because it came with great reviews , however my lab mix had it apart in hours . She did very much enjoyed it , but for the cost I wished it would have lasted longer .	-1
Although my dogs coat did feel soft and smelled great , the scent is not long lasting . There are more effective brands out there that do a far better job of keeping my pooch smelling fresh . Furthermore , this rinse was ineffective at lessening / combating my dogs post-bathtime long knotty locks .	-1
These crates used to be great quality , but the zinc rubbed off in less than a day of receiving it in lots of places and more importantly , zinc is not dogs best friend . If dogs ingest too much of this it could be poisonous . How do you know how much is too much when this coating rubs off like cheap jewelry . When you purchase an exercise pen , you expect the coating to last more than a day ... my first one did years ago . but I have bought more than 4 of these recently and the coatings are all rubbing off .	-1
It just was n't what I had hoped . The edges are very rough . Very easy to scratch yourself on or snag clothing . It is n't as sturdy as I had hoped and my puppy managed to climb right out of it even though she 's very tiny . ( she 's a pomeranian puppy and only weighs 2 pounds )	-1
The crate is okay . It has a divider and serves its purpose for a dog that is comfortable in a crate . The two-door design is nice . The metal wires are fairly flimsy , and I could see a determined dog destroying the crate and maybe getting hurt in the process . We use it for a puppy to sleep in at night . He is in the bedroom with us , so if he got too wild in the crate , I could address it . I would be hesitant to use this crate to separate dogs or for a high strung dog that will be left alone . I am writing this review because the crate actually cut me last night . I reached between the wires to move a toy inside the crate and caught my hand on a rough spot . I now have a three inch slice down the side of my hand . We have a PetMate crate for our other dog that seems much sturdier and safer without any pointy areas on the metal that could snag a human hand or a puppy paw . If your pup will be well behaved and not push the sides of this crate , it is probably okay , but if not , I would try another brand . I updated this and took away a star . I snagged my pants on another rough spot and ruined them . The company really needs to address the way the metal is connected and create smoother surfaces .	-1
This is my 3rd Midwest crate . Unfortunately this one is a dud ! The front door will not latch . The top latch is a good 5/8 off from the striker to make it latch and the door when closed without latching is bent 1/2 so it does n't sit flush . Also one of the wires at the welded point at the bottom of the front door broke off so theres a loose wire that could really hurt my dog . I think due to the weight , because it is very heavy , that UPS damaged it but I ca n't prove it since the box was NOT damaged.I 'm returning this one and ordering another one . Hopefully the next one will work .	-1
This item was not damaged in shipping , it was packaged that way . The FedX guy was still in the driveway and I had him take a look - the pan for the bottom has a gash//crack in it and that makes it useless and frankly dangerous for a puppy.The gauge of the wires is superior to most , which is why I ordered it . However , due to it arriving damaged I had to beat feet for another one here in town and I 'm not happy about that , not as sturdy.Sort of defeated the purpose of ordering to save some money and time . Yes it irritated me . Now I have to haul this thing in to return it .	-1
The good news : Price is excellent and Amazon fulfillment is amazing . I ordered this using my Prime membership , and the crate arrived overnight , even though I had chosen 2 day shipping . The bad news - just like other reviews I had read about this crate , the locks were not properly aligned , and no matter how we wiggled the door , it was impossible to lock both locks at the same time . As I watched my young puppy throw himself at the door after being put in the crate for the first time , with only one lock locking , he was able to push open the door enough that without supervision , he could have easily gotten himself wedged between the door and the crate and gotten seriously hurt . Needless to say , we did n't leave him in the crate . Since I 've read other reviewers that had experienced the same problem with misaligned locks , I have to wonder about the quality control in a company ( Not Amazon ) that would let an obviously defective unit leave their plant.The good news is that , as always , Amazon customer service was phenomenal . They shipped me a new unit overnight , along with a shipping label to return the old one . The trade could n't have been easier . New crate arrived the next day , as promised , and works as it should.So ... ... ... crate is an excellent buy , when functioning properly . But beware that I 'm not the first purchaser to have experienced defectiveness . However , since Amazon will easily replace a unit that does n't work properly , no harm in buying , because I am now pleased with the second unit I received .	-1
I have a 30lb pit bull who was able to break out of the crate door with minimal effort . I secured the door with bungee hooks , and the top with extra D hooks . She ripped the plastic crate liner to bits . Its a flimsy piece of plastic that will easily crack if flexed . This crate may be perfect for docile dogs or old dogs but a strong breed like a pit bull needs something more sturdy . That said , if anyone knows where I can get a metal crate pan , please reply to this post .	-1
Midwest lists this as the better model than their iCrate . Hmmmm ! ! The box says `` Value '' model . I 'd hate to see the other one LOL.I do n't know if it happens from shipping to the US ( yep , China made ) or the UPS handling -- or both . NOT one of the doors or frames were straight . Add to that the fact that you should be able to `` pull up one door , '' then the other to lock it in place -- not so . They are locked together by the hooks that hold them up ( when you get that far . ) Once the sides are vertical you get to see all the bent outter frame pieces . Get the mallet out ! ! The front door piece does NOT lock well to the frame . The U-shaped pieces that keep it together once assembled are tough the latch into . One would think that would lock everything in well . NOPE ! All those wavy frame pieces , even when straightened , do not really form a positive lock.I read other reviews about pan noise . The instructions tell you to keep the box so you can cut out a large piece to put between the pan and the frame > What ? ? How long will that last ? Does n't make it a real travel item.I have a feeling that putting this up and down to travel with it will cause a lot of problems eventually.My biggest fear now is putting a 50-lb Australian Cattle Dog in here and hope he does n't get out . Another reviewers idea of zip-ties scares me ; he 'll chew right threw that .	-1
We ordered a 36 and a 42 , for our two dogs . Both arrived in the original packaging . The 42 was taped on one end , as if it had previously been opened . The 36 worked fine . The 42 , it turns out , had a broken corner . The wire that forms the lower corner was cut or snapped , undermining the integrity of the frame , and make it hinge unsupported . The damaged was discovered just after the 30-day return window , so I could n't exchange it . Amazon graciously offered a partially refund , and I am attempting a repair on my own.Midwest 's packaging consists of a single-walled cardboard box , with no padding . This leaves the product vulnerable to damage , including bent wires and broken welds . `` Check contents immediately for damage '' is a good rule to follow . : - ) We bought these crates because of the side doors , so that we could put two crates with the long sides along a wall . Shipping/warehouse damage aside , these crates work well . The finish is attractive , and the rollers on the underside work well to protect the floor from scratches during movement . Midwest uses a heavier wire than PetEdge uses on their house-brand crates ( such asProSelect Steel Wire Smart Snap Dog Crate , Medium , Silver Sage ) , yielding a stiffer crate . We are using these at home , so we do n't mind the resulting extra weight.I would give these crates a 4.5 , if MidWest improved the packaging . As it is , I 'd think twice before ordering another crate by mail .	-1
This is VERY small , not a medium sized cat pan at all , the dimensions are inaccurate and should be noted as small .	-1
We ordered this item after seeing a lot of positive reviews and were VERY disappointed . It is poorly constructed , feels cheap , and the scissor design is not well executed in that the rake and scoop do not line up so it does NOT close - making it impossible to actually pick up the dog mess . We returned it immediately and ordered something a little more expensive and of better quality . I do not recommend this product .	-1
The rakes bent after a couple of uses , then they fell off after a couple more uses , making the product completely useless . Also , I found it to be small . Definitely not a sturdy product . I would invest my money elsewhere .	-1
The handle , fulcrum , and scoop body are all fine . However , the teeth bend very easily , leaving a gap between the scoops , which makes picking up poop a challenge . Yes , you can bend them back into place , but not the most appealing thing to do when they are covered in dog poo .	-1
I had this scoop for one week . That week was pretty great , not having to put my actual hand anywhere near my dog 's poop , but after a few uses , the one side of the scoop kept coming off the hinge and I 'd have to snap it back in place . Then this morning , the plastic around the hinge broke off and it is no longer usable . The price was low ... for a reason . Time to look for something more sturdy with solid construction !	-1
The springs rust , the plastic handle breaks as well making this impossible to use . maybe they should n't make it out dollar store plastics and bread tie metal .	-1
This is not built to last by any means . I ordered the large , the pan is very flimsy , a dollar store plastic dust pan has more rigidity and stability . The pan is not secured to the pole well either . How this item has nearly 5 stars with 170+ reviews is beyond me .	-1
Description does not say it 's wood handled ... shopping in a hurry.. all I noticed was the stainless steel description.. was going to return.. but would have to Pay return shipping which would probably be almost $ 10 , so not worth the hassle & loss of money . Description needs to be clearer . Have had the same stainless steel scooper w/ spade for over 10 yrs now ( buying a gift ) & it 's still in Great condition . Wood will probably eventually start splintering & such ... did not want wood .	-1
I laughed when another reviewer mentioned chasing the poop around the yard , but sadly it 's true.My dog uses varied backyard surfaces : **Grass - scooper catches in the grass and the tines bend**Flat dirt - above mentioned chasing**Seasonal leaves - the tines stab into the leaves which then block poo pickupBut above all , the worst is having to shove the poop ONTO the scooper . What good is it if I have to shove it with my foot ? Plus , as others have mentioned , the tines bend relatively easily , making the scooper very difficult to use . Even with my foot I have a hard time getting the turd up and over bent tines .	-1
The rake would pull out the grass . I have a Shih Tzu and a Lhasa Apso and their stool would fall between the teeth of the rake . Not worth the money .	-1
This one didnt work out for us.I have owned the grab and hold scoopers that work much better and make this unpleasant task quick and easy . We have 2 big dogs , that leave big and small turds.Problems:1 . The wires are soft , get tangled in the grass and stretched out , making it difficult to lever the poop . Now , the last problem is the structure has come apart , ( unglued ) from the vertical handle . Useless now . ( check out the photo I uploaded to illustrate the cheap material and poor construction ) .2 . The system is absurd , let 's the poop slide , so it takes me 3 times longer to grab and hold the turds to take them to the disposal location . Its me chasing turds around the grass , for 30 minutes . ( ! ? ? ) I have used it less than 4 months and here I am looking for another scooper . Not this one , for sure . Cheap ends up being more expensive .	-1
I do n't like it at all . First it seems to always get caught in the grass and its like I 'm having a tug of war with the grass over the poop , the worst part is when I pull to hard and rip up grass and it flings at me . Secondly one of the wires bent on it nothing worse than having to re bend the wire on the pooper scooper . Will be looking for a new pooper scooper .	-1
I have to update my review after using this rake a few months . It seemed to work okay where the grass is cut very short . It would probably work even better if you have yard with sod and there are no weeds in it . I live on acreage where there are all kinds of grasses and weeds . After a couple months of use , one outer tines bent badly after snagging on a vine or something . After that another tine next to it bent downward . Since that happened , it is time consuming to pick up the droppings only to have them fall off the rake before I can deposit it in the scoop or bag . I have not been able to bend the tines back into place.I had a couple of racks and pick up pan that lasted for years after lots of use and many dogs . It is disappointing and frustrating to buy these things now and have them break or bend after a couple of months and minimal use .	-1
when using it , it picked up more chunks of grass then it did the poo in the yard . I ended up putting it in the shed and used the neighbors . They have a small rake with a shovel which works 1000 times better . Would not buy this product again or would I recommend it to anyone .	-1
I do n't know why this thing has so many good reviews its terrible . Its a pain in the butt to get the poop off the ground , and even worse if you are trying to empty poop from the scooper into a bag . Forget about tossing crap over the fence , it will hit you in the face or fall on your head . This is basically a small rake , its crap . Get yourself a claw type with one handle .	-1
It falls apart all the time , leaving me a mess to clean up . It is very cheaply constructed . I have a similar 18 pound Petmate Replenish feeder for my dog that screws together . I do not know if the smaller equivalent works similarly , but I would not recommend this one .	-1
It was much smaller than I anticipated , really sized for a cat or toy breed . I bought it for larger dog , and had to send it back , so I ca n't really comment on its performance . It was light , but once filled with water , that probably wo n't be a problem . I have found that you really need pictures of products next to pets in order to judge their real size . Otherwise , it looked as advertised and I had no problems with the order , so it gets 2 stars	-1
When I first adopted my dogs off a friend he gave me the Le Bistro Water Feeder and the Le Bistro Food Feeder . The Water feeder works wonders and in the Summer time I freeze a small tub of ice and plop it into the rear feeder so the water that feeds into the dish is ice cold for them . I 'm very happy with the Le Bistro Water feeder but the Food Feeder is what I 'm giving 2 stars for *Actually would give 1.5* . I fill up the feeder to the top and happy to know my Dogs will be fed for the next couple weeks . But what I find is the Feeder drops more food than needed that I end up walking by the Feeder to see nothing but a giant pile of kibble laying on the floor around the Le Bistro Feeder dish . I thought maybe I just over filled it and next time filled it less but still got the same problem . Gravity would do it 's job and too much kibble would just come pouring outta the feeder spout that it 'd end up over flowing the dish and end up piled up around the dish . So I started putting a place mat underneath and every time I see it piled up I 'd just pick up the place mat and pour the excess back into the Le Bistro . It gets a little annoying and a hassle after awhile . Be nice if it did it 's job of serving enough to fit the dish and not overflow it everytime !	-1
Garbage . Plastic hook and tab construction . Flimsy . Rex knocks it apart . Expect a big mess of cat fud on de floor . After cleaning it up and reconstructing a few times I duck taped it together . But `` Remember it 's only temporary . Unless it works . '' - Red Green .	-1
The photo is deceiving . This arrived without a lid , so you have to tip it over to fill , and try and fit it in the bottom without spilling the water all over . I think they are using a photo of the FEEDER , which does have a lid . This is a big difference.The feeder is great , but I will probably return the waterer , it 's too hard to fill .	-1
Brand new and bottom broke . very expensive as well . Too bad I can not send back . I had it for alot of animals outside . My chicken coop caught winter electrical fire , so bottle got burnt anyway .	-1
I bought this for my 16 week old kitten . It arrived today and first of all it was not shipped in a compatible carton , byt stuffed diagonally into a huge box.When I removed it I felt sharp edges and examined it - apparently this injection molder is lost in the dark ages of plastics . When a sot comes off the mold , all edges and corners should be smoothed out or trimmed . This product is dangerous . Almost every area has sharp jagged residual plastic which could injure a kitten . In addition it is very cheaply made and would never survive aggressive kitten behavior.Save your money ; there are many much better interactive cat toys available .	-1
Although my cat has another track toy that he loves , he just does n't like this one . He 's played with it a couple of times but always gives up after a minute or two . I think the ball is too hidden and does n't really zip around like the other track toy .	-1
I figured this would fascinate my cat . He has not even looked at it . I push the ball around and he 's totally uninterested . Not that this is n't a great toy . The idea is super and I 'm guessing there are a lot of cats who love this toy . My cat does n't seem to like any type of & # 34 ; ball & # 34 ; toy . But we all know how cats can change their minds about things . I 'm keeping the toy just in case . I 'm giving this only two stars because my cat currently will not play with this toy .	-1
I bought the small version of this toy . I brought it home , set it down in front of my two 10 week old kittens , rolled the ball around two or three times . They did n't even look at it . I returned it and got my money back .	-1
Well , glad I ordered 2 packs of these since 1 in each pack would not plunge without putting too much air in our abandoned kitten 's bellies ...	-1
I purchased this to remove pet hair from clothing . We have a goldendoodle and his he sheds a fair amount . This product is more like a sponge than anything . Outside of not being very effective at removing hair , it leaves little bits of sponge on your clothes , which looks even worse ! Save your money and purchase one of the red lint brush products out there . Much more effective than this inferior product .	-1
Does n't really removed hair and is a hassle to clean and dry . There 's nothing better than the sticky roller for pet hair removal in my opinion	-1
I 'm actually not very happy with this lead because I use it with a command collar . I have to be able to pull and snap back on the collar to reprimand my dog as part of his training but this lead stretches so much that it does n't really work . I 'm debating sending it back and just making one out of a rope or something . Otherwise , it is what it is and at least it 's not expensive .	-1
I was on the phone and the pup felt ignored . She took this into her bed and chomped it into bits in just a few minutes . Not for strong chewers . She 's not particularly mouthy , though she does seem to have a generalized hatred of leashes . Still , this is the only one she 's sliced up into bits , so I ca n't recommend it for larger breeds since I hardly got any use out of it before it was snacked on .	-1
I realize the leash was only $ 10 qnd is made of cotton but my dog chewed 3/4 of the way thru the leash in less than 10 mins ! I do n't see this guy lasting very long although I will try to reinforce it with duct tape to keep him from chewing the rest of the way in that spot but still i would have hoped it would last a little while longer .	-1
The muzzle appears to be new , but it did not come in a package ( as pictured on website ) . It looks like seller is buying bulk items and then re-selling them . Cheap price ( $ 5.39 ) , but muzzle is very stiff ( backpack type material ) with somewhat rough seems . I had to guess at the size since it was not stated . I got an extra large because I have a Chow-Newfoundland mix . It is a little on the big side . I plan on just using it when my dog has to have his nails trimmed at vet ( they ask for this ) . Since my dog is not a biter or chewer it works ok . However , if you have a dog that has to wear a muzzle for an extended period of time , is a biter or tries to get muzzles off , this is NOT the product you want to get.Note : The product may be lacking , but seller shipped the product quickly and was very nice to work with .	-1
I suppose my cocker spaniel is a small one . He is full grown . This muzzle covered his whole face . I do n't have the package to send it back . I just have to cut it down to size and resew it to fit him . It came within a weeks time frame . So the vender was good about that . It looks like it is leather , but it is n't . It is a black vinyl .	-1
As the other reviewers have said , this is too big around my dog 's neck . I had to sew the elastic to make it fit and even then it 's still a little too loose . This is clearly an issue , because the size we ordered just barely fits the girth of my dog and the neck seems to have been constructed for a dog 3x his size . Before resizing the neck he could spin and easily slip out of the harness . Now he spins and becomes tangled in the seatbelt . Neither is a very good outcome . I would not recommend this product .	-1
My puppy pooped in her crate her first night home so we had to wash the bottom mat and after doing so on normal wash for only the 2nd time ( I had washed it as soon as we got it before putting it in the crate ) the seams at one of the corners came out . I did tumble dry/air dry with ultra low heat . I suggest you wash it under delicate settings to avoid the seams ripping .	-1
I had a very sick cat and my vet suggested I try probiotics to settle her stomach . It did n't work for her . I am not sure if it was because she was so sick or the product . I would put it in her food and she did n't care for it . I preferred it over the liquid probiotic products as they were just too smelly for me .	-1
It seems to me that if someone else has a different opinion about a product , they tend to mark your review as unhelpful . These people need to get a life . I have stated important FACTS about this product and you 're a hater and a fool to mark this review as anything other than helpful . The reason I say this is because the exact same review is also posted by me for FORTIFLORA where , so far , 8 out of 8 people find it helpful.Purina Fortiflora Feline Nutritional Supplement Box , 30gmI encourage anyone who may have questions about my trials with this product to please post them on here . I will do my best to answer you in a timely manner . Also feel free to leave any advise or findings of your own.I remember taking Twix ( my cat ) to the vet and thinking the worst . From birth she just never seemed as vibrant as her two siblings . Every time you would try to pick her up or hold her , you would soon get a whiff of really bad gas . Not quite a year old she lay lifeless , sick , and far too skinny . The vet ran many test and I reached my limit around the $ 400 range . They could n't tell me what was wrong but upon my mention of lifelong diarrhea , had recommended Forti-Flora ( $ 40 for 30 pkts ) It was less than a week and Twix had come to life . Her gas although not totally absent , had not been that dreadful smell that made you want to drop her and hurl . For the first time in a long time she was finally using the litter box again and she was regular.A month later , and no Forti Flora she slowly went back to the way she had been . AMAZON to the rescue . I was discouraged however because I did n't plan on the extra expense and chore of administering this probiotic every day . I already went through the trouble of finding the best food for her needs.I ran across an item on Amazon ( Animal Essentials Plant Enzymes & Probiotics ) that promised more and the price swayed me to try it . AWEFUL MISTAKE . We let the other animals use it as well , and seemed like they all had bad side effects . Twix especially looking more sick than ever.There 's just no way possible I could recommend this product . If your cat has the same symptoms as mine , I really recommend staying away from this product.I 'm going to keep using Forti Flora for as long as I have my baby girl , Twix . I have to feed her seperate from her brother , Neiman . He is crazy about the taste of the product . So is Twix . I 'm so glad I found it for so much less than at my vet . But even if I had to make the purchase through my vet , I WOULD ! My baby girl is worth it . Also , I am a fair person . This bottle of probiotic by far a lot more product than what you get with fortflora . It just too bad it did n't work for my cat and I used as directed until we ran out . I was thankful it was gone . I had to get something that would work for TwixANOTHER UPDATE : just to bend over backward to try and be helpful as this is my most unpopular review , I found a great product at a lower price point than fortiflora and works very well . You may see the review here : http : //www.amazon.com/review/RJX90E5J8CL29/ref=cm_cr_dp_title ? ie=UTF8 & ASIN ; =B0053G8XE6 & nodeID ; =2619533011 & store ; =pet-supplies	-1
This bunched up irreparably the very first time I got put it in the washer . I washed this on cold and dried it on the most gentle setting , but it was still disfigured and covered in black lint-clumps . Nothing else has ever done that in my washer . The reviews here indicated that this product could stand up to washing , but apparently not . Very unsatisfying to have something ruined so quickly . I got this to put in my puppy 's crate ; I would not recommend this product to anyone who is crate-training their dog , because if he has an accident , his bed might be ruined .	-1
My vet refuses to carry this product as the pyrethrin aka permethrin is highly toxic to most mammals ( dogs , cats , humans ... ) . It should not be used on any dog that comes in contact with cats at all . Cats will react more quickly to the product as they do n't metabolize the toxins as quickly as humans and dogs . You should know that your pet does not need to lick th product to become poisoned . The chemical is absorbed into the skin , readily . Imagine giving your dog enough toxin to kill fleas a month after application . Is n't that over-kill ? There are less-toxic alternatives , but I 'm not sure that any of the big-name brands are actually safe . If the instructions require you to wash your hands after applying them- why is it Ok to leave it on your pet 's skin and wo n't you be petting your pet ? ( Read the last paragraph for natural flea-prevention tips ) Permetrhins are toxic . However , given to a dog in small doses , you may not notice effects for many months or years . Even if you do n't witness any issues your dog may be having headaches and other neurologic symptoms . A dog that has seemed fine with this product for years may suddenly hit a threshold level that causes severe and noticeable neurologic problems . Death from pyrethrins is a lot more common than many vets think . Bayer will likely always deny that their product killed any pet . The owners often believe the company . This is why so many of the deaths ( and near-deaths ) are unreported ( they are `` reported '' but not recorded ) . The best we can do is make sure reports are kept track of and if the proper authorities are not looking out for us , we need to look our for ourselves.My pets do n't require flea-preventives because they are on a raw diet . The flea-repelling quality of raw-fed pets does not occur overnight , so do n't expect your fleas to disappear if you switch your pet 's diet . It took me months to get my pets naturally flea free . There are all natural flea remedies out there such as Diatomaceous EarthConcern 97064 Diatomaceous Earth Crawling Insect Killer 4 Pound Bagand `` Natural Defense '' Sentry Natural Defense Flea & Tick Squeeze-On for Dogs & Puppies over 40 lbs ( 6 month dose - 4.5 mL applicators ) Please try these before loading your pet and home with toxins . For your carpet and home you can use a simple Boric Acid powder ( Such as Borax- which is cheap and easy to find ) . Just use as directed to kill all fleas , roaches , ants and other bugs that lurk in and around your home . Be sure to vacuum the Boric Acid up very well as it can be toxic if there is a long enough exposure to it.Good luck folks !	-1
We used this for years but the fleas in this area no longer are affected by it . We had to go to the Tritack to control the fleas in this area .	-1
My dog had a skin reaction to this product . Unfortunately , I will not be able to purchase this product again .	-1
I switched from Revolution to Advantix for the tick control . Bottom line , this product does not work as advertised.I took my dog ( treated with Advantix - advertised tick protection ) , and my mom 's dog ( control - no tick protection ) into the hills for a hike . Both dogs were kept mostly on the trail , both dogs did brush against the grass . After the hike , my mom 's dog with no tick repellent picked up 7 ticks . My dog , 4 days after Advantix application ( no baths ) , picked up a dozen ticks . Not only did we pull 12 ticks off him within 48 hours of the hike , none of them appeared to be dying . The advantix may work a little ... both my husband and I found ticks crawling toward our heads after sitting on the couch with the dog . The ticks do n't die and still attach , but watch out ... they may look for a tastier meal at home - YOU !	-1
My Shih tzu almost died after using this product . Before you put this on your pet do some research . You will find that many many dogs have had serious allergic side effects from this product and many have died . We still do not know if my Shih tzu is going to live or not . PLEASE DO YOUR RESEARCH BEFORE YOU BUY THIS PRODUCT	-1
I used Frontline Plus ever since it came out . Never had a flea , but this year fleas have been out of control due to the mild winter , hence flea infestations in the yards , I plan to address when a safe lawn flea product arrives . This early summer Frontline Plus seemd to be completely ineffective , despite consistent treatments for all 3 dogs , vacuuming , laundering and spraying beds , but the dogs still brought in fleas and gave them to the cats , who were also treated with Frontline , but then I also switched my cats to Advantage . So , for my dogs , I switched to this very expensive Advantix II about 2 months ago . But before applying , I gave them baths in Dawn liquid , which my vet said would kill any live fleas on the dog , so at least I could eliminate the ones present before applying the Advantix II . The Dawn worked well as I saw a lot of dead fleas in the water going down the drain . I also bathed my 2 cats in Dawn ( another story ) . However , after 2 months of using Advantix II , I am still picking fleas off my dogs , big fleas , baby fleas , still seeing flea dirt , and my dogs are biting at the fleas and scratching as are my cats with Advantage , so I assume the fleas are still biting them ! I 'm not impressed with this product or Advantage for that matter ! The rumors are that there are counterfeits of these flea treatments , so ONLY buy from your vet ( at the highest price out there of course ) .Well , I bought this from my vet . So now what 's the excuse Bayer ?	-1
Dog is experiencing severe allergic reaction to this product . Chewing places where it is applied , lethargic , severe skin redness . Do not use this - it is not worth it . I am returning the remainder of this immediately .	-1
I USED THIS FOR 2 SUMMERS ON MY DOG TO PREVENT FLEAS.SHE 'S AN INSIDE DOG BUT IS OUTSIDE WHEN WE ARE.WE LIVE NEXT TO A WOODS SO I THOUGHT THIS WOULD BE THE PRODUCT TO USE . I DID NOT GET IT FROM THIS SITE BUT ANOTHER REPUTABLE SITE THAT WAS RECOMMEND BY AKC.FOR MOST OF THE TIME SHE HAD CHRONIC DIARREHA WHEN SHE HAD BEEN TREATED.I HAD THE VET TEST HER FOR DIFFERENT THINGS TO FIND OUT WHY . EVERYTHING CAME BACK NEGATIVE AND HE DID NOT KNOW WHY.LOTS OF MONEY WASTED ! THE LAST TIME WE PUT THIS ON HER SHE MUST HAVE LICKED HER FUR.SHE PACED AND WHINED THAT AFTERNOON AND IN THE NIGHT I WOKE UP TO A REAL NIGHTMARE.SHE HAD EXPLOSIVE DIARREHA ALL OVER OUR HOUSE ! ! SHE WAS VOMITING AND DROOLING.I GOT OUT MY CARPET SHAMPOOER AND CLEANED UP.I CALLED THE ON CALL VET @ 4AM ! I HAVE NOT USED THIS SINCE AND SHE HAS HAD NO PROBLEMS.I THINK IT CAN BE DANGEROUS TO SOME DOGS.THE COMPANY DID NOT WANT TO HEAR MY EXPERIENCE EITHER.I MIGHT TRY THE PILL COMFORTIS , I PRAY THAT SHE DOES N'T HAVE PROBLEMS WITH IT !	-1
Used K9 Advantix believing it to be top of the line . After one dose , my dog became extremely hyper - kept running in circles . He 'd stare blankly and started crying . He started to vomit , bright red blood was coming from his rectum . He was bouncing off walls , running into objects , moaning strangely , and got very paranoid . He had a very difficult time breathing , rising body temperature and , lastly , lost the use of his hind legs as he was dragging them behind him in total panic . All of these symptoms manifest within 4 hours . We called our vet who wanted to see him immediately . They were prepared with IV meds , took blood tests , ordered x-rays and used scanning equipment because they HAD treated this before . Outcome was not promising . After two days in the hospital , we brought our baby home . What was the cause ? Bayer 's K9 Advantix - the medication with the highest concentrate of Permethrin . Our dog had succumb to Permethrin Poisoning . More common than you know . I 've run the gamut of every agency I knew , filed reports and complaints , but this appears to be a very hush-hush deal . I asked my vet , who has treated other dogs with similar reactions to Permethrin in K9 Advantix , exactly what he has seen for symptoms and outcomes . He replied everything from organ failure to permanent paralysis to death . My vet 's office does not recommend K9 Advantix to any pet owner as they 've seen , first hand , the pain and suffering a dose of K9 Advantix can have on a pet . Do n't kid yourself , you can use K9 Advantix for a year with absolutely no side effects , but it takes just one time for your pet to react adversely and have to go through what we did . Permethrin is a very potent poison used to kill hearty weeds . Bottom line , Bayer produces a `` medication '' that contains high levels of a toxic poison . Does anyone see how `` sick '' this situation is ? ? ? ? There is an on-line blog called [ ... ] where you can read through 15 pages of actual testimonials from pet owners who have had to deal with the complications caused by Bayer 's K9 Advantix . I pray you do n't ever experience what our family did , nor any of the families who have lost their precious pets to K9 Advantix - God Bless you All !	-1
We bought this before talking to our vet , the side effects just were n't worth it . Moral of the story is talk to your vet before you buy anything like this .	-1
DO NOT BUY ! ! ! ! Complete waste of money . Bought it , did everything the instructions said to do ... .and nothing . The collar was tight , I shaved the area , I tested it , and my dog still barks . I even put it on myself and after maybe 50 barks it worked once .	-1
I thought for the price this would be good . It did n't work . It would go off sometimes when the other dog barked that did n't have it on and sometimes it would n't go off at all with the dog that had it on barking . I had to send it back .	-1
This causes seizures in dogs and is torturous for the animal ... Some people would do anything for money and I am shocked at Amazon for even considering selling this product ... if your dog is happy and content , it will not bark , so it must be something you are doing wrong , dog owners and manufacturers of this garbage ... I shall write Amazon about this product but stop selling it NOW ... ! ! ! ... I have also contacted the ASPCA ... for their reaction ...	-1
What a worthless product . It almost never worked for my dog ( an australian shepherd ) . He would bark and the collar did nothing . Randomly , once in a long while , it would work . Most of the time it did n't . And yes , we had the fit correct ( it was practically choking him ) .The battery went dead , so we bought new ones from the company . Switched it out , and now the collar does n't work at all.What a piece of junk .	-1
I have not used this collar yet because there is something missing in the package ... ... . a battery . I ordered the sometimes bought together package . I went back and looked at it and the numbers on those batteries are different from the ones indicated in the instruction manual . Apparently , this company does not include a battery to start you off . If the bought together batteries are incorrect , I will be very angry .	-1
I used this on my spaniel mix . I used the lowest setting . We were outside and my dog barked and she literally leaped off the ground and she yelped and yelped . I was in shock over how strong a reaction she had . I was pretty much horrified . I took the collar off and brought my dog into the house . she ran under the table shaking and petrified . It took her around 2 or 3 hours for her to begin to be herself again . I felt terrible that I had inflicted that kind of trauma upon her . I decided to try the shock on me which I should have done in the first place . It made me really jump and say OW ! It is not fun . What a barbaric and horrible product.I took it back to the pet store and exchanged for the Petsmart citronella spray bark collar . The citronella spray collar is far more humane and it works for the barking.I have been training my dog in other areas and she is doing well but I could do with some help and I am considering getting a collar that has the vibration only option . NO SHOCK . I would never use shock again .	-1
does not seem to have much affect on our two year old sheltie . It did make her yelp a couple of times but after less than a week ( unless the battery is dead already ) does not seem to work Kind of disappointed !	-1
I thought this would give a little shock like static electricity , but it gives off a shock hard enough to have our dog yelp & whine in pain . I will not use the collar , but will keep working with our dog .	-1
I returned this item for two main reasons:1 . Dog can only wear anti-bark collar alone , you must remove regular collar . In doing so you remove all ID tags . Not good.2 . If you dog is furry it does not work , and you have to shave their neck where the collar connects . I do n't THINK SO ! Perhaps if you have a dog without long fur and you do n't mind them going without any dog tags , then go for it.I wo n't be using it on my precious pup ~	-1
I 'm so disappointed in this product ! DO NOT USE ! It does not stop my dog from barking , it barely phases her . It stops her loud barks , but not her softer ones that she does more often . It stopped working after two weeks , so now , it does nothing .	-1
We really liked this trainer at first . It did help to get our dog 's attention and he nicely became more cooperative . However , it has never worked for a distance . It only works for about 10 feet . We 've had it for over a year and have dealt with increasing problems . The batteries need replacing every two weeks , the shock works sporatically , and a couple of times the stimulation ( shock ) button stuck , which was not at all what we would ever want to happen . I would suggest you look for a collar with rechargable batteries and one for longer distances .	-1
I tried this trainer on my German Shepherd . It eats the expensive batteries like my dog eats kibble- I had to buy new ones weekly . I was even being certain to turn it off at night for bedtime and during the work day.With brand new batteries in , i would do a training session , and halfway through , the dog stopped responding . I checked the collar after increasing the level and it had turned off . This happened every time I tried to use the collar . called the manufacturer , and no luck , no refunds , no exchange , lousy service.I also work with a group of aggressive dogs working on training . at the trainer 's behest , several participants are using electronic collars . the 2 participants using this one are not happy . either the stimulation is insufficient for their dog , or the battery issue gets to them.The collar worked well as a training tool when it was on , but the unpredictability of it turning of defeats the whole purpose-anyone who works with dogs knows inconsistency is the failure of training .	-1
When the remote is working properly is works well . However , it often does n't work . I changed batteries and it still has very sporadic performance . You can not expect it to work at a distance of over 10 yards . Most times is works 50-75 % of the time . The quality of the remote is cheap plastic . After a few months of use , the remote started to fall apart and made it difficult to press the buttons . Also the dial for the level of shock does n't seem very accurate.Generally , I would n't recommend this device . Find a better more reliable one .	-1
The picture for this is deceiving as they have changed the style of the remote . In previous versions you would get the remote with the dial style settings but the one I received is a digital style display with buttons up and down to adjust the settings . Just that would n't have been a problem but for me the issue was the previous remote took a 9V battery and the new remotes take the same button style batteries as the collar . These button batteries are not like normal button batteries as the voltage is slightly different than a regular button battery from the store . So you can either buy the PetSafe button batteries ( I would normally get a couple weeks of use as sometimes I forgot to turn the collar off ) or you can take the risk of using regular button batteries and the voltage difference may effect the collar/remote.Also this collar has made our dog worse , this type of correction just made him fearful and more prone to aggression . We ended up going to a dog trainer and using a positive training method which worked better for us . Guess it depends on your dog as to how well this collar will work for you .	-1
Bought this for my finches but they go check it out and fly off without so much as a bite . I threw some out to the pigeons and not even they will eat it Wasted my money .	-1
Squeaker was out in about 5 minutes , from then on it was shredded to pieces . It got shook around and just kept coming apart .	-1
After reading the reviews I thought this would be perfect for my new rescue dog who seems to chew more than our other dog . It was n't . The head and tail were chewed to bits in probably less than 10 minutes . My dog is a Sheltie , probably German Shepherd mix so we are n't talking mega-jaws here . I gave the extra star because it is cute but did not have the durability that I expected from Kong toys .	-1
My 1-year old Lab played with this toy about 10 minutes and had ripped the eyes out . I sewed the hole shut . Within another 5 minutes she had the seams ripped apart and holes in the head of the toy . Not recommended for a chewer .	-1
Bought this for my 3 beagle puppies ( 7 months old ) because they have the uncanny ability to destroy most toys very quickly . I had good experiences with Kong products in the past for MUCH larger dogs ( about 80 pounds larger ) . Gave the Kong snake to my puppies last night around 7:45pm . It was destroyed and in the trash by 8:30pm . The beagles loved it , but within minutes they found the small amount of stuffing used in this product ( the head ) and pulled it out . They were then able to grab the fabric from inside the snake 's mouth and started pulling at that until the poor guy was practically inside-out.I expect better from Kong . Come on , these are 25 pound beagles , not pit bulls .	-1
My dog is a 12 pound chihuahua/poodle mix . We tested the product before putting it on the dog and it sprays just fine . We put it on the dog and since the dog has more of a whine/howl than a bark , I guess it does n't pick it up . We tried adjusting it so that the sprayer sits closer to his neck but it still did n't work . It just never went off . I was really hopeful because I do n't want to use a shock collar but I guess I have no other choice . This might work if you have a bigger dog with an actual bark but it 's just not happening for my little guy .	-1
Just got it yesterday . Does n't work at all . Going to try to get new batteries and whatnot today . I know someone previously mentioned this but I neglected to take warning : you can not return this item to amazon . So even if it does n't work -- it 's all yours .	-1
Somebody said that this product works for a small dog . Too big for my Chihuahua . Plus she figured out how to loosen the belt and get it off her neck . So useless on two fronts.Why not make a smaller one for small dogs ? ?	-1
This did n't work on my barking Pom . He just kept barking & did n't miss a beat . I let a friend use it for her dog & it did n't work on him either .	-1
I have yorkies and maltese and this collar is huge . My dog ate off the original black collar so I found a wide ribbon to tie it back on . Does not always work , possibly due to misfit for a small/toy sized dogs . Mine are all 4-8 lbs .	-1
I purchased two of these through Amazon . One of the two did not work at all . I was unable to return to Amazon ( for safety reasons concerning the butane refill ) .I paid to send the device to Premier and the manufacturer sent a replacement . After using it a couple of times , the collar would not stop spraying the citronella even after it was turned off ! When I then tried the second new one , the device over heated and was hot to the touch where the battery resides . If you do use this product be careful and never leave it on when you are not there to see how it performs .	-1
The theory behind these Citronella Gentle Spray Anti Bark Collars is great , BUT all 4 collars I bought ( along with the extra spray and extra batteries that I ca n't use any more ) for my 4 dogs quit working after about a month of light use ! These collars were not cheep , nor were the extras that I needed to buy , to keep them working ! Now I find out that I can not return anything ... Not the collars , not the spray , not the batteries . I am very unhappy with this expensive purchase of around $ 300.00 ! My suggestion is NOT to buy these collars unless you have a LOT of Money to Waste !	-1
I purchased one of these collars for my beagle who barks non-stop . When I put the collar on her the first time , she barked once , got sprayed , and ( finally ) shut up . I was in heaven . I would use it when she went outside in the morning so she did n't wake up the neighbors and occasionally during the day when she was being overly loud . Three weeks into having the product , I noticed she was barking with it on a lot more . I checked and it was n't working . I assumed the battery was dead and bought a new battery . Nothing . Called Premier and they told me to return the unit and they would replace it . I realized this would mean I 'd be without a bark collar for about two weeks , so , I ordered a second unit.The second unit arrived , sprayed three times , and died . I attempted to just return it to Amazon , but because there is an aerosol can in the box , they wo n't accept the return.So , now I 'm stuck with two units , neither of which works , and will have to wait at least two weeks to get a replacement that might or might not work . Because of this , I can not recommend this product .	-1
This is my third spray type bark collar . I 've in the past purchase the Multi-vet brand and they worked great at first but quit after about 3 months . I decided for my new dog to try a different brand so , I brought the Premier brand . This one looks just like the others . The only difference is this one only worked for about a month . A month was not long enough to teach my new dog not to bark . Replacing the battery and cleaning the sprayer did help . I wish they would make a spray collar that would last .	-1
I purchased this collar twice , the first one lasted about a year and did the job of controlling my dogs barking quite well . After approximately one year it simply stopped working , I replaced the battery , but still nothing . I figured oh well , it did work well on my dog and I got a decent amount of use out of it , so I bought another of the same product . Well , this one only worked for about a week . Unfortunately I had n't bought from amazon , I purchased it at the local pet store and had n't kept my receipt , knowing the spray collar was affective at controlling my dogs barking when needed . I contacted the manufacturer and they were very unwilling to stand behind their defective product . They would n't fix the defective collar or replace with a new one , even though I had been a loyal customer , purchasing 2 of their collars . The spray collars do work very well on my dog for controlling nuisance barking so my suggestion would be to try it on your dog , but not this brand . Several companies make them and if you get one that is defective , hopefully they would be more willing to stand behind their product .	-1
I USED THIS ON MY DOGS AND IT WORKED FOR ALITTLE BIT AND THEN IT STOPPED I USED IT MAYBE THREE TIMES AND THAT WAS IT .	-1
My 2 dogs got used to the citronella spary after 2 days , so then they just continued to bark while it sprayed	-1
This was too big for our mini-dachies so we stop using it . We were able to stop her barking with spray bottles/water hose and water ( she does n't like water ) so a gentle & # 34 ; No & # 34 ; and a squirt of water and she is another dog	-1
A few seconds after putting this on my dog , it sprayed for no reason . Then my dog shook his head & his ears flapped , it sprayed again . This is a very inferior product , buy it if you want to confuse your dog . The product is not returnable due to it containing hazardous materials ( marked ORM-D when shipped ) . The one made by Innotek works , mine lasted 4 years and unfortunately was replaced with this garbage .	-1
Tried this in the house and the first time our Lab stopped after the first bark . Thought we had found the answer . She likes to bark at people coming into our subdivision and runs out to greet everybody which is what we were hoping to get under control . We did n't realize the collar is n't & # 34 ; waterproof & # 34 ; and we live on a river . We had it on her and she continued to bark and run out to meet the cars . Black Lab + river = collar that does n't work very well anymore . Guess a shock collar is the next thing to try .	-1
I friend recommend this product to me , but I did n't care for it at all . The spraying of citronella was over powering for my dog whenever he barked . I needed to wash my dog thoroughly because the smell made him sneeze too strong .	-1
Not only did my dog continue to bark , it only got her face wet and made her and the whole house smell horrible . My family and I were gagging , we would never buy this product again .	-1
People remember how sensitive dogs noses are . I feel terrible because I forgot and purchased these to stop the barking . These did n't stop the barking but my dogs did smell like citronella constantly and they learned how to twist the collars so that they were on the side of their necks and not spraying up their noses .	-1
The premier anti-bark collar worked well at first and is a great idea . However , I found the battery wore down quickly . The batteries it uses are real expensive . The collar still did n't work after I replaced the battery possibly because the expensive battery had sat on the store shelf for too long . I do n't feel I can afford to maintain this collar .	-1
My greyhound ( adopted ~2 months ago ) suffers from severe separation anxiety . She is currently on an anti-anxiety medication ( Clomicalm ) , which so far has not been effective in curbing her incessant barking and howling when left alone ( I have done everything in the book when it comes to trying to lessen her S.A. ) . I ordered this collar as a last-ditch attempt at being able to leave her for an hour or two to run errands/go to doctor appointments without worrying that my neighbors would complain to the condo association . I always have access to my webcam via my cell phone when I leave my dog alone , so I was able to watch from downstairs to see her reaction when she started barking . I noticed that she did not go on a barking `` spree '' as usual , but rather , barked once , got sprayed , and high-tailed it to her bed where she laid down . She was still able to vocalize ( whining/crying ) but I believe getting the citronella spray actually helped shift her attention , thus ending the barking episode . I was gone for about 2 hours today , and she only barked 3-4 times . This is a huge improvement from barking/howling for 15+ minutes straight with only a few minutes of quiet before starting up again.I 'm not exactly proud or happy that I had to resort to this product , but it is effective . I would not recommend this collar for dogs with separation anxiety unless you have tried absolutely everything else ( for example , my dog did not improve from any of these : Kongs filled with treats , calming music/radio/tv , toys/chews , being crated/un-crated/baby-gated , plenty of exercise , Dog Appeasing Pheromone ( DAP ) spray , tryptophan gel ) . My parents use shock collars on their dogs to curb the barking , but Luna is a sensitive dog and I believe a shock collar would seriously distress her . She did not seem any worse for wear due to the citronella . I hope that this , combined with the meds and training , will help her become calm and quiet when left alone.EDIT : Was not at all effective after day 3 of wearing while alone . Would not recommend for dogs with separation anxiety .	-1
This product functions properly , however it did n't work on my dog . It would spray her once but when she had incessant barking , she would n't care and it wo uld n't go off again	-1
It just did n't work for us . We have an Aussie Terrier and he had no problem being sprayed . Could n't have cared less . And we found the collar difficult to use . I felt really dumb for having bought it in the first place . : = (	-1
When offered to rats , be prepared for a lot of picking and choosing what will be eaten . The dried vegetables seem to be the preferred bits . My rats will throw the alfalfa bits completely out of the cage . Seed mixtures tend to be fatty , although I have n't seen too many rats eat very much of the seeds . It 's not nutritionally balanced for rats , either . They wo n't get the animal protein they need from a diet like this . Not a good choice for rats at all .	-1
They changed the ingredients on this , its no longer alfalfa free and has bits of alfalfa hay in it now . I had been using this for over 5 years and I was really happy with it . I was extremely disappointed , they now offer the old formula at a almost 50 % price increase . I am very disappointed with Kaytee for this .	-1
This product eventually turns brown . That 's all it seems to do . Maybe it removes phosphate , but I have no tool to measure if it does or not . As for helping control of get rid of algae ( presumably through lowering phosphate levels ) ... NOPE ! Made no impact on my tanks what-so-ever .	-1
I used this in conjunction with Algone nitrogen remover but the algae just kept on growing . I did better just cleaning off my glass and saving my money .	-1
My papillon puppy could care less about these . I have offered them to her and had them laying out for 5 weekes , has never chewed on them , not even the & # 34 ; chicken & # 34 ; one . Might be just her preference , she will chew on the Orka bone or on the Get Naked sticks but not these .	-1
My puppy did n't like these . She did chew one of them a little bit but did n't seem interested in it after the one time . I do n't know if it was the taste or the consistency but she just did n't like it . I would not buy them again.I was glad they are small enough for a little dog or puppy . I have a morkie and she is only 5lbs at 3 months old so finding small things for her to chew is a challenge sometimes .	-1
I brought my pup one of this when he started to finish his Puppy Nylabone too quickly . At first he did n't take it because it did n't smell like anything . I slowly played with him with this bone and he took it . Then he just ripped them into huge chunks ! He even swallowed some and vomited afterward ! This are way too soft they should make it a bit stronger and add more flavoring .	-1
dog wo n't even touch it.. has no smell at all and a dog wont chew on something that does n't smell good to them.. do not recommend this product at all	-1
There was no flexibility in these at all , So hard I was afraid after reading other reviews that my dog would break a tooth so I threw them away . There are `` flexible '' chews for sale , I worry much less with those in his mouth .	-1
As some of the others have said , my puppy only wanted the flavored bone . The other two did n't interest him in the slightest .	-1
i have a 6 mth old 7 lb puppy and her 1st bone did n't last 20 min ... gone devoured ... now I have to worry all night if it will pass thru her system safely . I expected this would last longer for a 7 lb . dog could n't imagine it lasting any time at all for larger puppies/dogs .	-1
My dog hated these . She smelled them , tried chewing them and then whined . She munched on the softest one and ate some of it and it gave her a tummy ache . I could hear her tummy growling : ( Will not buy again .	-1
My puppy is going through the chewing time now . He chews everything he can find : furniture , shoes , sticks , stones , ... everything he can find . So I gave him this starter kit thinking it should be more attractive to a dog than the stones from our back yard -- big mistake . He played with it for 5 minutes . Then he buried the plastic bones in the sofa and put the edible one in to his water bowl where it successfully disintegrated . That was the end of this starter kit , my puppy went back to chewing furniture , sticks , and stones , those look a lot more attractive to him .	-1
This is a great starter kit for the price . However , I wish they made it in different sizes because they are TINY . The chicken puppy chew was one my dog loved , but it was chewed down to a nub within a week or two . They make these in larger sizes.My dog is okay with the Durachew ( white one ) , but not as interested in the flavored chicken puppy bone . But when she ca n't find it , she goes for it.The edible chew says not to use for puppies under 6 months ... So it is just sitting for the next few months which makes it WAY too small of my dog at that point.This set is good for small/tiny breeds , but any bigger and just get them individually with larger bones . It definitely prevents furniture chewing !	-1
Our Vizsla puppy was not interested in the synthetic bones at all . We feel they were money wasted . He did enjoy the edible bone . Being a constant chewer , it took him about 2-3 days to get through it . We 've since bought several more edible nylabones from petsmart . I think we 'll stick with the kong chew toys though .	-1
There is only one bone in here my dog would even chew , and that was the one that was rawhide-ish . The two others are similar to plastic . The puppy turned up her nose at them because they were n't any flavor or desired consistency ( trust me , my boyfriend licked one ! haha ! )	-1
Nowhere was it mentioned this is EDIBLE . I assumed these were typical Nylabones . My dog almost choked . She bit off one whole end knob . I would like to return the remaining 2 . I certainly will not give them to her . And she is an 11 pound adult dog . I shudder to think what could happen to a puppy . Nylabone - what were you thinking ?	-1
Smell awful and breaks off into small pieces . Definately a choking hazard for puppies . Be very careful with these .	-1
The white bone so far has lasted but the dog is not into it . The other two the dog has actually eaten ( which I think they are supposed to based on Nylabone 's website ) but that really scares me as our puppy swallowed big chunks and though they eventually dissolved enough to pass that was really scary .	-1
Not for puppies ! Ridiculous . I bought for 8-9 lb chihuahua , she could n't handle these big bones . I will give them to friend with full grown golden retriever . I have had small , perfect size from nylabone in the past . These are definitely NOT AS LABELED .	-1
I purchased this for my new puppy , but she did n't like any of the three . She will occasionally pick up one , but then drops it in less than a minute .	-1
my puppy ate a part of the bone and started choking and screaming . do not buy . i have to bring her to the vet tomorrow to make sure she is okay now	-1
My dogs love anything they can chew ... EXCEPT these . I do not know why . Maybe because they do n't smell right ? I even tried soaking them and it did n't work . Not sure what to do with them now .	-1
These are hard plastic , not rubberized , just hard shiny plastic . Hard for the digs to keep in their paws and mouths . The carry them around but really cheering on then they do n't . They have no grip and they just do not like to play with them as much as their other nylabones . They do seem to like to lick them so there must be a flavor . I would n't buy then again .	-1
I guess I 'm in the minority . I had heard that these were a problem and shrugged off the warning as one from the few malcontents having a bad day and bought this . Good chewing BUT ... ..they made my dog sick and he barfed five times . And guess what came up ? And , yes , the sharp little edges were still there . No more nylabone products for me . I feel so strongly about the danger of these products that I am making the effort to go to every nylabone product on Amazon to post this warning . ( Also , these are rock-hard ; your dog may break a tooth . ) mb	-1
These bones were chewed down quickly . I was really disappointed because Nylabones used to be the only thing I felt good about giving my dogs .	-1
That 's how long it took my 1.5yr old 65lb Lab/Husky to polish this off . Glad he enjoyed it , but really disappointed in how fast it disappeared . I bought three flavors in the `` souper '' size but no longer have great expectations .	-1
My puppy destroyed this toy in less than 2 days and to make it worse , he was swallowing the pieces that were coming out of it .	-1
Our puppy ended up biting chunks off of the ends . It was more of a hazard to us and I had to throw it away . It is definitely NOT for aggressive chewers . Our dog is a 6mo , 13lb Havanese .	-1
Definitely will give up if your dog really tries to take bit by piece apart . Granted a corgi swaying and tossing keys around is lovely but this is not a long term toy .	-1
One chomp by my puppy removed a sliver of this toy . MAYBE chunks are ok , but a sliver is never a good thing . It 's a hard toy , so the slivers are no slackers . The size of the keys themselves were not too large ( min . poodle puppy - 3 mos . ) .Get a `` puppy-sized '' Kong . Indestructible.Skip these , no matter how cute they are ! mb	-1
I got this for my teething four month old german shepherd puppy . She was interested in it for 15 minutes when I first gave it to her but has n't been back to it since . I 'm hoping she 'll get interested in it again because I really like the center part for her to chew on . So far however , it was a pretty expensive 15 minutes .	-1
this is a really hard toy - no give to the plastic , so my dogs totally ignore it . if your dog likes to chew on screw drivers or something maybe they 'd dig it	-1
My dog became very sick after eating a Nylabone chew toy with red sections . All of the Nylabone chew toys I bought came from China , and I wo n't buy them anymore . That said , she has a few Nylabone chew toys without any dyed parts on them , i.e . whitish bones , and has not gotten sick from them . So I have n't thrown them out . However , as for future ingestible chew toys , I 'm sticking to American-made products . NOTE : Nylabone Healthy Edibles treats ( not chew toys ) are made in the U.S. , and my dogs love them .	-1
My 70lb yellow lab is a power chewer , and seems to think her mission in chewing is to pick things apart ( like meat off a bone ) . I 've been really pleased with almost all of the Nylabone products that we 've given her , and my only reservation with this bone was that she might go on a search and destroy mission on the green part.But what happened instead was that she picked apart the end pieces , getting `` too large to ingest '' chunks off , and revealed the hollow center . I was disappointed .	-1
My dog is a pitbull/boxer mix and I got this toy after reading the reviews , since they were mainly good reveiws . However he destroyed in in one night . He chewed a whole in the middle , ends did get sharp when he chewed it . So I dont reccomend this if your dog is a strong enough chewer to destroy the product .	-1
Poor instructions , takes forever to grow and must be repotted . I have a `` green thumb '' and my plants are still only 1/2 '' tall after almost 2 months . You 're much better off just buying some catnip seeds and using your own potting soil and pot . Any pot would look better than the cheap plastic tub provided.It 's not catnip but I highly recommend the Kitty Garden : SmartCat 3844 Kitty ? s Garden Edible Grass PlanterIt grows fast , looks good and my kittens love it .	-1
Had great hopes for this -- - however , it never bloomed . Disappointing because I wanted to give my `` babies '' something they would enjoy .	-1
I followed the instructions to the letter , but nothing grew but mold . Very disappointing ! Would not recommend or buy this product again !	-1
It was useless and did n't grow worth jack . I followed the instructions and when nothing happened decided to water more , at that point I saw two tiny leaves ... and then a week later they died . Got to love the fake lush image of growing plants when it does n't work at all . I wish I could get my money back . I bought this from Jeffers Pet , online .	-1
I thought the overwhelming positive reviews were convincing BUT the few that say the lids do not fit are correct . I am a strong guy and I can not make the lid snugly fit over the bowl . I have to return it unfortunately . Having a hard time finding the right travel bowl .	-1
While the lid does stay on pretty well , it does n't actually snap down over the whole circumference of the bowl . It 's like the lid is just a bit too small for the bowl.On the plus side , the bowl seems to be very high quality and apart from the lid not fitting it does n't feel too cheap.The main reason I bought this bowl was because my energetic 12lb cat kept flipping over his water bowls.This morning , after I filled it almost all the way full with water , I found he had flipped it over and made a huge puddle on the carpet.I put some water in it again , and an hour later I found that he had flipped it over again.So if you have an energetic pet who likes to tip over their water bowls , this does n't provide the solution to that problem . ( AKA it is n't a tip over proof water container . )	-1
My Lhasa Apso has some terrier in her that makes her very hyper . I thought that this would help when she frustrates me . Well , this did n't actually calm her down , and it gave her terrible diarrhea and vomiting for 4 days . I will never buy again .	-1
My dog can not stand these . Sorry the taste can not even be hidden in her food . So have to say NOT on these . She has had others she tolerates . Also as far as they work once I got them down her was ok but I have had better ones for her and they are cheaper..	-1
I have a big German Shepherd who is very scared of thunder . I was trying different products to help him . This tablets do not work for him at all ... .. I do not recommend this product .	-1
We have a young Golden Retriever who throws up w/in the first hour of a car trip ( even if we do n't feed her beforehand ) . We tried this product three times and it did nothing for her anxiety and the inevitable throw up ( even with no meal in her tummy ) . On the third try , we gave her one pill more than directed to see if this made any difference . It did not . In my opinion , this product is a waste of money and does n't even begin to calm our dogs travel anxiety . I 'm surprised that so many others had such good success .	-1
It worked ok - it really did n't do what was advertised but it did calm my dogs down a little bit . I use it for when it storms - my dogs tend to freak out during storms . I will probably try something else - this is the second product I have tried and it did work better than the first one .	-1
I have a mini dachshund and bought hoping to calm her down on a plane ride . I tried it out before I booked my flight and it did n't work at all .	-1
I sent this to my brother in Illinois so that his Yorkie and Schnauzer would be calmer for the drive to NC-it was worthless . I could n't recommend . I have been hearing that Recue Remedy does work-according to a veterinarian . I will try that .	-1
My dog would not touch these , they do not look like natural chips -they look like pieces of starched fabric folded in half in rectangular shapes . Not made in USA . Gave to my neighbor who 's dogs are not picky like mine .	-1
I ordered this from Amazon , and unfortunately it arrived missing the bracket that attaches it to the cage . So I boxed it back up and dropped it off at UPS to return it ( for some reason , exchanging it was n't an option ) ; next door to UPS there happens to be a pet store . I ran in and was able to buy the same item off the shelf -- more expensive than Amazon but at least I could verify that it was n't missing parts . I got it home and installed it -- as I was adjusting it the bracket snapped off the base of the dish . It was barely welded on there at all . I give up . Now I have to hope the pet store will take it back ( I had already removed the label ) . I would really not recommend this and wo n't be purchasing it again .	-1
this is too large for a cockatiel and I feel too rough - on the package it says not for the bird to sleep on - I did not see that in the description - so heads up this perch should only be an alternative because it will be too rough on the birds feet and cause the feet to bleed	-1
So i see a WARNING on this after it arrives in a box to make sure your bird does n't ingest any pieces because it is made with cement or something similar and if i had read that before i ordered it i would n't have purchased it ! Maybe she would n't have bothered it but i was n't going to take a chance and have my parrot get sick and or maybe die . And that is what WILL HAPPEN IF YOUR BIRD INGESTS ANY OF THIS ! ! ~ ! ! No thank you i will only buy safe perch 's from now on ! They also run big ! I ordered a medium and it was too big for my amazon or grey anyway . Amazon was great about getting me my refund right away . And they had UPS come to my door and pick it up . Thank you Amazon for taking care of this so promptly . I only wish others would n't take the chance so NO birds have to die ! Why do they even make something so dangerous ?	-1
1 ) This Perch is so rough it will tear up your Bird 's Feet ! And will give you a Vet Bill to pay ! 2 ) I ordered the SMALL and got a size that would fit a Condor ! ! ! Because it is sent out by Amazon ... I was not offered the option of Seller Feedback ! Now I get to waste my precious time trying to get my money back ... make arrangements to getthis Wrong Item sent back ... and UPS in our area refuses to do Pickups ... I am debilitated to drop-offsare not an option for me ... This is the SECOND TIME ... I have ordered small items for my Canary and have had them ignore that andsend me HUGE items instead ! ! ! I am Done ! ! !	-1
Salacin was the original precursor to aspirin , aspirin itself was developed to avoid the stomach irritation effects of Salacin . Including stomach bleeding . The dose here is probably too low to hurt , but people should know that willow bark preparations are not safer than aspirin .	-1
Thought this was an alternative to aspirin only to find out its more of an arthritis supplement . Dog hates taking it , its a big pill and have to crush it up and hide it in something . Would not buy this product again .	-1
Not so sure this is great stuff . I gave it to my 9 year old arthritic Leonberger , and it made her sleepy and VERY grouchy . She did n't even want to take it and I gave it to her anyway . Normally I give her a potato bread sandwich with Glucosamine , Chondroitin , MSM , Vitamin C , Turmeric and blackstrap molasses , which she loves and which quite obviously helps her feel lots better and quite perky . I only gave her this because I was running late and did n't have time to make her sandwich . I 'll put it in the First Aid Kit , but we wo n't be using it every day .	-1
Update : I have had this substrate in three of my planted aquaria for the past few months and plant growth is practically non existent . Black brush algae on the other hand , is growing all over the surface of this substrate.It is possible that the bags of Eco Complete that I purchased were defective . A few people have made this comment . Perhaps that is why I was able to purchase these bags for about $ 20 each , instead of the $ 30 plus that they usually sell for.I have also noticed some of the white stones in this substrate that other aquarists who purchased ECO Complete - and had less than stellar results - have mentioned.Anyway , I have now purchased some Seachem Fluorite and will be using this to replace the ECO Complete in some of my planted aquaria.Interestingly enough , the best plant growth that I have attained thus far has been by using play sand and Seachem Flourish root tabs . This has allowed for the rapid carpeting of both microsword and dwarf hairgrass.Earlier..I had decided to rescape two of my planted aquaria and purchased a few bags of Eco-Complete to use as the new substrate . I purchased three 20 LB bags on sale for about $ 20 per bag . I have had this substrate in my tanks for a few months now and the dwarf hairgrass and microsword that I have in these tanks has yet to carpet.I even added some Flourish plant tabs which work quite well in an inert sand substrate , yet the growth of these plants has been minimal.On the positive side , plants do stay well rooted in this substrate , even if they grow at a snail 's pace .	-1
I 'm giving 1 star so anyone looking for a con can see this . I am not entirely sure if it was this product or the Fluval Plant Stratum , 16.7-Pound . I mixed ( layered ) the two ( which it now says not to ) .I have a 50G column tank with a Renna XP2 canister and had 3 , 5 year old angel fish in it and loads of live plants , Co2 and LED light . I had been using Flourite but decided to change things up a bit and go with the ADA black look . Tank has been stable for 5 years.I left my filter alone , cleared out the fluorite , and gave a really gentle rinse to this stuff and put it down and then put the Carib Sea on top and then put a couple driftwoods back in and re-planted my tank . My fish were all in my 10 G quarantine tank for the day . I filled the tank , de-chlorinated , started up the filter , turned on the lights and Co2 and put in a few drops of the clarifying stuff one of these products came with . Let the tank run for about 6-7 hours and get up to temp and it looked good . All seemed ok. A water test ( one without ammonia test on the strip ) looked good , Ph was good . So I put my fish in and they seemed happy . Ate well and were exploring the & # 34 ; new & # 34 ; tank . I went to bed and when I got up 7 hours later , all of my fish were dead . I did another water test and checked the ammonia with the ammonia test this time and it was through the roof . With all of my fish dead I just let the tank run for a week with nothing in it and it stabilized . Did a 40 % water change and waited another week , still stable . Put a few cheap mollies in and they thrived so I bought new baby angels and all has been good . Talked to other hobbyists and many others said these substrates can cause an ammonia spike . So please take heed and maybe give 24 hours before re-introducing fish . Be sure it really is stable.I like how easy it is to plant in this . The plants seem to be doing well and they take hold well . I would buy the product again but I would wait at lest 24 hours before putting my fish in , or at least make sure I 'm awake and watching them so I can tell if they are experiencing distress .	-1
I 'm not sure what sort of cages these things are meant to latch to , they certainly do n't fit on to my smallish metal ones . Maybe if you have a cage with VERY thin bars with no more than 1/2 inch of space between the bars . I 'll probably end up crushing these and using them in bird bread , and they 're sort of worthless if you planned on having them available for your bird to use in their cage .	-1
Maybe it is a fluke , but one of the pieces in my pack smelled like old ( rancid ) oil . The other smelled okay so I tried to give it to my 2 birds , and they would n't touch it . May be worth the gamble at such a low price , but I wo n't be purchasing any more .	-1
These are nice-sized cuttlebones and normally I would have given them five stars . However , although there are two cuttlebones in the package , there is only one metal clip with which to hang them . If , like me , you have more than one birdcage , you 'll be short one clip .	-1
Maybe my Buttercup and Westley are weird parakeets , but they are n't impressed with the good reviews on this product . They treat the orange mineral block as if it 's some kind of decoration , just something to climb over occasionally and otherwise ignore .	-1
I am not sure what it is about this block but my budgies wo n't touch it . I just hangs there looking very new . Has been for weeks .	-1
I was hoping that this accessory bag would replace the separate poop bag dispenser dangling from my leash handle , but it 's too big . The velcro straps ca n't be adjusted tight enough to make it fit my 23 ' Flexi Explore for small dogs , making it neither comfortable nor convenient to use . Also , the zipper compartments are larger than what I need for routine daily dog walks . This product might work if you use a large-dog leash and need to carry more gear .	-1
Nice product while it lasted . The elastic will pull out of the area where it is sewn on to the pouches and the front will also start to pull out from where it is sewn . It was used on a Flexi Leash as shown and like I said did a good job while it lasted but for the price I think it should last longer than 3 months . I am not hard on the leashes nor were they chewn on or over stuffed , The product just simply did not last .	-1
I love the idea of this product , but when I strap it on , it 's far too big and makes the attachment awkward.Even in the product photo , you can see the straps between the two sides are so long , the item hangs down too far.It 's clearly made for a large retractable leash , but not my medium one . For me , was a waste of money .	-1
If you love flexi-leashes , you simply HAVE TO GET THIS KIND OF BAG . You will love the convenience.I had to purchase a new one after my sweet pit mistook the attached bag as a chew toy and obliterated it.THIS BRAND IS NOT VERY GOOD.Instead , BUY THE 'OUTWARD HOUND ' BRAND virtually identical product because:1 . The zippers are totally flimsy and cheap on the flexi brand compared to Outward Hound.2 . The nylon used for the bag is really thin , cheap and does not hold it shape and form as well as the very thick and durable Outward Hound brand.3 . If you like multiple pocket options , the again the Outward Hound has both the regular zipper pouches as well as net like outer quick slip in/out spots .	-1
Did n't like this millet at all . It literally came dirty and the bag ripped . I just thru it out when I got it . The millet instead was also very dry and flakey .	-1
This pkg contained the smallest millet I have ever seen ( and I 've seen A LOT of millet ) . I 'm almost afraid to put it in the keet 's cage it looks so bad . ( I did put it in and usually they jump on it but they are staying far away ) ... I guess I 'll stick to buying it by the pound . Last purchase I made here was a pound box and it was long and plump , not skinny and scrawny .	-1
My dog wo n't pee near the post . I do n't know what it is ! My neighbor 's dogs do . But mine wo n't . So I have to give it a poor review .	-1
My dog will pee on anything sticking out of the ground . This did n't attract him anymore than a plain wooden stake .	-1
The dogs looked at it sniffed it walked away & have n't gone back to it . I am returning this it does n't work .	-1
Would n't recommend this product . They did n't work for me . I put two of them in strategic areas and the dogs barely bothered to scent them . Maybe if they were taller they would be more attractive but after you stick them into the ground these are a scant few inches high .	-1
did not work did not work.. the gardener thinks its some fertilizer stake or something so leaves it in the ground . even the squireels do n't like it	-1
I read the reviews before buying this , but bought it anyway because I was willing to try training them to go on it , I have been wanting them to go in a certain area of the yard instead of all over the yard or patio . Problem is they never even peed on it once , I started by praising them when they peed near it , but not once did they pee on it . My youngest dane who is still a puppy pulled it out of the ground one day and frolicked around the yard with it , so I guess there is an entertainment value , but basically they do NOT see it as something to pee on but as a random thingy they should n't pee on . Says it 's non toxic , hope they 're telling the truth about that at least , my puppy had it in his mouth .	-1
I have a cat who has decided to mark the world ( i.e. , my house ) as his . All the furniture has been soaked , and I 've already put zippers in the couch cushions and replaced the stuffing with pillows to make then easy to wash . I picked this up on impulse at Petsmart , along with a gallon of refill . I was excited because the package said you can use it in the laundry . Unfortunately , it not only does n't remove cat pee smell , but leaves a nasty smell of it 's own when it dries . I have n't noticed much difference in laundry , but this weekend he 's been on a tear : walls , cushions , blankets . I 've squirted almost the entire bottle on stuff to no avail . That 's why I 'm here on Amazon looking for something else . Once this dries , the smell comes back . Maybe it works better on barf or something , but not cat pee !	-1
I generally buy Natures Miracle at PETsMART and it works great . This item however leaves an odor and does not do a great job at removing pet urine . It will work a bit , but I would recommend other products .	-1
It looks large because of the dome shape , but it is surprisingly small . The only cat we have that uses this box is a kitten , our 2 adult cats will not use it . I wanted to see if it keeps the urine in the box better than others , but have n't really had a chance to because of its light-to-none use by our adult cats.A nice pro of this is that it traps odor well . I think this would be a great box for smaller cats , just not for our household .	-1
I wanted a covered litter box for our screened in porch . The larger cats ( 15 lbs or so ) will not even go in . The smaller cats put their bodies in and lift their rears and pee or poop right out the door . The pan part is too low and even if they turn around the pee goes between the lip of the dome and the pan and gets all over the floor . I would NOT recommend it this litter box , except perhaps for kittens .	-1
Some very odd decisions must have gone into the design of this box , I 've had it for three weeks and am finally getting kind of used to it , but am still curious as to why so many aspects of this thing are so obviously flawed.First , it DOES cut down on the kitties tracking litter out of the box and onto the floor . Somehow the little staircase traps the loose litter before they leave the box . It may just be a result of the fact the entrance is so set back in the box , that when they scratch or shake off , it happens away from the door.However , those same stairs are contoured in such a way that it is impossible to clean the loose litter from them without lifting and tilting the whole bottom tray into the trash . This can only be done with an empty box . Vacuuming works , but only if there is no wet mess.Also , it 's called a `` Jumbo '' box , but because it is round and the stairs carve out about a third of the footprint , it 's much smaller than other jumbo litterboxes.The roundness is handsome , and although the thing looks big , it is prettier than your average litterbox . I think the same thing could have been accomplished with a squared-off box . This would make it MUCH easier to scoop or get a snug liner in there , because this thing is almost impossible to scoop cleanly . The liner bunches up in the rounded `` corners '' and does n't really fit too well to begin with . I am using Booda liners , and they are curiously loose even when I use the `` clip '' inside the box . Having a square or rectangular base would also make this thing bigger inside which would be nice.As I noted , it 's not all bad , and the good is enough to bump this thing up to three stars , and I would think it would be great if you only had one cat ... PROS : cool lookinghidden littergood filterlittle/no litter trackinglittle/no leakage from the space between the lid and baseCONS : largeholds less litter than similarly sized rectangular boxesliners do n't fit snugly ( much worse than regular boxes ) difficult to cleanca n't lift the entire box using the handle ( only the lid ) expensiveUPDATE : I ditched this impossible to clean nightmare and got a high-backed rectangular box witha lid and a swinging door . SO much better , with only a little tracking , but not nearly as much back-breaking digging and scooping .	-1
It looks bigger then it is since the stairs are within the dome . My cats bump the cover when they move inside and sometimes the lid comes off slighly and number ones hit the liner and leak out the side ... definately not good.They do love the privacy , but I am constantly worrying that the top wo n't stay secure .	-1
This litter box sucks . I had to throw it in the dumpster after using it for ONE DAY . It 's too small , even as a secondary litter box my big female cat made a huge mess of herself trying to use it , the top kept coming off ( it is not attached at all ! ) , it does n't keep odor away even with the filter , the `` ramp '' is a total gimmick , litter consistently goes in the cracks of the device , the stairs , EVERYWHERE really . This thing is a total piece of garbage . TOTAL , UTTER , COMPLETE GARBAGE .	-1
This seems like such a good idea . If it was well constructed , it would be . The dome cover sort of fits , but the filter apparatus on the top is just a bad design and does n't fit snug so beware of it falling on your cat and never ever using the box for a second time .	-1
I used this dome for a couple of weeks and then gave it away . It is difficult to line up the top and bottom . The filter does not stay in place . The bags are super difficult to put in . It is difficult to clean the steps and sides if any urine gets on them . Great idea , but needs work !	-1
i bought this hoping to keep litter off of the floor - what i got was poop on the floor ! my three cats all avoided it with the cover on , and only the smallest would use it even without the cover . one of them started defecating about a foot from it - i had to put puppy pads on the floor until i replaced this box . i thought it was just my picky cat until i saw an episode of My Cat From Hell on Animal Planet - the same thing was going on with a cat and this box - the cat therapist told the owners to get rid of this box and the problem stopped with that cat also . i bought a low sided , clear plastic storage box about 24 inches long for $ 4.00 - the cats like it and it was certainly cheaper ! !	-1
I 've been looking for a decent cat litter box for a while now and kept putting it off because i loved the one i already had but YOU must replace your litter box at least every 6 - 8 months so mine was coming close to a year and it was just getting bad ... I got this because of the awesome design and the stairs thinking this would hold back more litter where as it makes my cat drag even MORE out now ! ! To begin ... .It did n't start well from when it arrived from UPS because the packaging was sooooo bad the whole thing had gotten scratched and bumped all around . I had half a mind to send it back but i loath on-line returns and procedures so i said I 'll just put it somewhere that i wo n't be able to see it all the time so it wo n't bother me.I 've bought 3 different types of bag brands and sizes and they all do not fit properly . Big problem ! ! None sit properly , fit right ... You CAN NOT lift the whole thing from the top because it does n't actually clasp together shut so if you want to actually move it you need to carry it from the bottom ! Where as with my old one , i just grabbed the handle took it to the bathroom cleaned/washed/and changed it all up and put it back ! And my last complaint for the evening is going to be the actual inside layout/design were the litter goes ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... .OMG ... ..Yes , you save tons of litter because it does n't need/take as much as the normal rectangular ones but to actually get a good scoop will take you at least double if not more time than cleaning your normal litter box.NO do not buy ! No i do not recommend ! No i would never buy again !	-1
I was excited to see this product since it seems large enough for my extra-large cat . He also has arthritis , so the ramp/steps are wonderful , but the lid ? The lid just sits on top . There are no latches , like with other litter boxes , to keep this lid in place ! What idiot thought THAT was a good idea ! ?	-1
This is by far the worst litter box I have ever owned . I had high hopes for it - I was hoping that the design , and the walk to the litter , would keep one of my dogs from getting inside and pulling things out.However , the top does not lock onto the bottom , and it 's very hard to tell if you have it in the right spot when the liner is in.This causes two problems : 1 ) My dog had no problems popping the top off to get what she wanted . And 2 ) When putting it back together from the dog , or even just cleaning , you ca n't tell if it 's on right.So twice now I have gone to replace the liner at the end of the week and had pools of cat urine on the floor underneath the litter box because I had thought I had it on securely and it clearly was not.This would be fixed by some locks on the litter box , and they are sorely missing.I have since gone back to an old litter box because trying to get cat urine out from under the washing machine the box is next to is not exactly a fun time .	-1
I love innovative litter boxes and decided to try this fun igloo shaped box.The stairs were cute . Unfortunately , there is n't much room on the inside for cat business and if you have a large cat , it will hang its hiney over the edge onto the stairs and produce a pee waterfall.I do n't recommend this at all !	-1
Meh . The cats do n't use the stairs - they both just jump over the side wall into the litter . They kick litter onto the stairs then pee on the stairs which are a pain to clean . I moved recently and just threw this litter box out - we 'll have a fresh start with something more basic . Plusses though - it is HUGE - plenty of room for my big ol Ragdoll kitty .	-1
This box has many benefits , but the drawbacks outweigh them by far with my frisky 8-month-old little girl.The amount of litter that is tracked out is minimal , and the dome and filter work well for reducing odors . This litter box definitely delivers on both of these issues.However , my little kitty has successfully knocked off the lid numerous times . There is no way to latch the lid to the bottom , and unfortunately the lid shifts often . If you combine the shaky lid with a female cat , you get urine leaking through the crack and on the floor . Not pleasant or desired . Despite the unique and useful design of this product , I would not recommend it .	-1
I 'm not a fan , but I use it . My cats use this box with no troubles , but I have a big cat . I 'm not sure if it 's his size that 's the issue . He poos in the box just fine , but when he pees he ends up being on the stairs ( sometimes ) It becomes a huge mess.Pros : - Enclosed- Stairs trap litter off their pawsCons : - Weirdly shaped so putting a bag in will be challenging.- 13-15LB cat has a hard time fitting in it.- Cat can pee on stairs making a hassle to clean up	-1
One of our cats likes to pee standing so does it toward the back where the slit is on the top and bottom for the partition break for the stairs - pee goes out the back and onto the tile floor . We gave up using it for that . They also kick litter down the stairs and one peed on the stairs a few times - nasty clean up .	-1
I was really excited about this litter box . The pros are : The color is very nice , my cat likes the stairs and it seems to keep control of the litter . The cons are- The top does n't fit snug . I do n't know if mine just has a defect or what , but it wo n't clip on correctly . Also , My filter wo n't attach the top correctly . If these were fixed , it would be a great litter box . I thought about returning it , but I will just use it for now and purchase a different brand litter box soon .	-1
We purchased this to keep the cats from urinating over the back , now they urinate over the middle and the steps are constantly filled with urine . It is a must clean every day . Needless to say , I am replacing it . I have tried just about every litter box made . Finally have decided to just use one that has a very high back .	-1
I bought two , one for upstairs and one for down . I just changed brand of litter , so it may become better but I am wishing I bought open top and square , not round . Several cons : one difficult to push up in corners , due to round and big . Ca n't see what is in it , till you take lid off , and lid is so big , difficult to maneuver in small spaces , inside litter area actually is small , odors consolidate in the box for cat to be smelling while using , and litter gets all over the stairs which is a pain to clean . Not really liking this product . Which I would of bought one with very high sides and open . Would be much easier to scoop and see what is going on , without moving the huge lid . Better for cat , also . Wish I could send back ... ... .	-1
I like the idea of the hidden scoop . It would be ideal , except the scoop is horrible . It 's very cheaply made- nice and large in size , but it 's flexible . I 've never had a scoop that bent when I used it ( I use World 's Best- not clay litter ) . The scoop ruins the whole unit .	-1
Love the idea of the scoop and hide , but this product is relatively flimsy and breaks easily . It 's infuriating to be scooping litter and have it bend - is n't this a simple problem solved by a little product engineering ? Then , on cue , it broke . Never buying this product again .	-1
After spending 15 minutes using Goo Gone Sticker Lifter to try to remove the sticker residue , I realized that my life was wasting away . I tossed the container but will keep the sifter to keep this purchase from being a total loss . I 'll come up with a different storage method , probably using a container made for a purpose other than holding a litter scoop . The container is cheaply made anyway . Overall , a waste of my $ 9.99 . I find that pet products are often overpriced and made without much quality , and that assessment fits this product.On a more positive note , I love the Booda Dome litter box .	-1
The scoop bends when you scoop . Good idea to hide the scoop , stronger plastic is needed to be more durable .	-1
I bought one of theseBooda Scoop'N Hide Litter Scoop , Pearlfor the first time about 6 years ago . It was great ~ I liked having a discreet and neat place to store the scoop in my cat 's poop and scoop corner.Only recently did the scoop break ~ the handle snapped off right in the middle of a scoop . It was messy and unpleasant with plastic , litter and you can guess what else flying everywhere . I looked all over for another scoop to fit the holder or just another set but had no luck . I just happened across this set at Amazon ( could n't find a replacement scoop though ) and was delighted to purchase it for about the same price as I did 6 years ago.Unfortunately the quality of my second one ( same Booda brand ) is not the same . The scoop is not as sturdy as before and feels so flimsy , I am afraid I am going to have a repeat episode of the last break soon . There is way too much give with every plunge into the litter and the handle bends under the weight of even the lightest load . This scoop will definitely not last another 6 years.That 's very disappointing and I will not be buying theBooda Scoop'N Hide Litter Scoop , Pearlagain , at Amazon or anywhere . I am however going to keep my eyes open for another scoop which will fit in the holder because I love the storage concept . Is n't it odd that Booda does n't offer a replacement scoop though ? ***October 15 , 2010 REVISED REVIEW AND LOWER RATING***Unfortunately I have had to drop my rating from 3 stars to 1 . The handle of the scoop broke off mid-scoop this morning . What a piece of crap .	-1
Usually I have something in my other hand when I am reaching for this scooper , which does not just come out easily..you have to shake it back and forth to nudge it out . Really a pain in the arse . Toilet brush holders and these holders are usually just really simple but it is a very obnoxious job just getting the scooper out of this annoying little holder .	-1
Lasted a week before it got bent in half . Storage 'bin ' was great for hiding scoop , however scoop was very weak and bent in half after the first week . Was not impressed . Ended up buying a metal scoop .	-1
Whose bright idea was it to put tines on the bottom of the scoop ? Makes it useless for scraping the bottom of the box when needed . I find more clumps break when using this scoop than others without the projections on the bottom . Great idea of a scoop then hide but poor execution .	-1
I did n't remember reading these reviews until I got home with this product . I bought it at Petsmart for the same price ( plus tax ) . Two complaints negate the usefulness of this product.Litter leaks out from the bottom of the holder.The scoop has large separations between the tines . Not good for picking up little pieces - they keep sliding through , and it 's hard to pick them up with the corners of the scoop too , since there is an open space right next to the corners . I measured the diameters : the large round holes are 1/2 '' , some of the spaces between the tines are 1/4 '' , the rest are 3/8 '' .In addition , the scoop is flimsy , and I do n't know why they made the handle part that faces out hollow - or half-hollow anyway . Also , the scalloped edge of the scoop does n't help anything . A straight edge would be better.If this item was well-made without the problems above , then it would be worth the money.What I 'm going to look for now , is some sort of small plastic box , that will hold a regular scoop .	-1
Your use of excessive adhesive is uncalled for . The residue left after removing your lables is sticky , very noticeable and can not beremoved . No matter what you use to remove the labels adhesive leaves residue and if you try to clean the glue off it removes the color of item ... so much for color coordinated ... ... .Go back to the drawing board ... ... ... .	-1
The litter box still smells like poop to me , and so does my room that I have it in . Do n't see a difference with and without this filter .	-1
Does not fit a circular cat box what so ever ! Extremely thin ! My 4 month old kitten scratches though it in 2 days . Buy the heavy duty liners at Shop Rite ! Do not get the auto delivery ! So glad that I did not do that ! ! !	-1
These were supposed to fit in the Booda Dome I purchased . They were extremely difficult to use as was the dome and I ended up giving the dome and the bags away .	-1
I ordered these liners thinking they would be circular and designed to specifically fit the Booda Dome Litter Box.NOT the case at all ! The liners are rectangular . They barely fit around the small Booda Dome.And on top of it ... the liners are rather thin - not & # 34 ; heavy duty & # 34 ; at all ! So glad that I did not sign up for the & # 34 ; automatic & # 34 ; delivery of these !	-1
I purchased this grinder through Amazon . I got it today and lo and behold , it did n't work at all ! It wo n't even turn on ! Of course I ca n't return it to Amazon because I opened the package of grinder heads to attach one ... assuming it was going to turn on . So , I had to call Oster and now am having to deal with shipping it to them . So , not only did I have to pay the initial shipping to get the defective one from Amazon , I now have to pay to ship the defective one to Oster ! If I knew this was going to be so much trouble , I would have gone to Walmart and purchased a regular dremel ! At least if it did n't work I 'd only have to take it down the road to return it ! Save yourself the aggravation and money ... go to Walmart !	-1
This did n't work right out of the package . Looking at other reviews on here it seems to be a common issue . Too bad Oster used to be a name that meant quality . I was going to try an exchange , but I guess now I 'll just try and fight to get my money back.I have the Pedipaw but wanted something a little more powerful and one that I was n't constantly buying batteries for .	-1
Received this nail grinder and was immediately taken aback by how loud the thing was as was my dog . Oster 's website describes this item as `` Super-Safe Operation : Whisper-quiet , low torque motor '' . Now I ca n't say that this nail grinder is n't safe , and I ca n't tell you how well it works since my dog freaked out over the noise and I never got to try it , but it sure is n't `` Whisper Quiet '' . If your dog is a bit skittish I would think twice about this one .	-1
I purchase this about a year ago because it had great reviews and because ( since most of my dog 's nails are opaque black ) I thought it would be easier to trim her nails than with clippers . I was so wrong . First off , she 's a rescue and had never seen anything like this before . She was terrified when I turned it on and started shaking . The instructions recommend turning it on without the & # 34 ; grit & # 34 ; and hold it up to your dog 's paw to desensitize him or her . That did not work . That was about the one thing I could discern from the directions , as they are awful.Nevertheless , my boyfriend and I held her down and attempted to grind her nails . It took forever and she was shaking the entire time and would n't even take the treats that we were trying to give her to calm down . It took about 40 minutes to trim all 12 ( she has dew claws ) nails and she would n't go near either of us for about an hour afterward.After this terrible experience , I bit the bullet , went to PETCO and bought a cheap pair of clippers for about $ 10 . I 'm sure that there are many available on Amazon for cheaper and that are better , but these work great . They have a little safety guard that lets you set the amount of length you want to take off , so even though I ca n't see the quick on my dog 's nails , I never cut too much . I do n't know why I was so afraid of clippers in the first place , but they are 100 % better for my dog than this nail grinder .	-1
This peice of junk stopped functioning correctly . After only using it lightly a couple of times , it only functions on the highest setting , which means that I ca n't use it on all my pets anymore . Waste of money . Do yourself a favor and go to a hardware store and buy a multi-speed dremmel .	-1
Your dog needs to be ok with the sound of nail grinding or it wo n't work . I have medium sized breeds and I felt I could have used more power to effectively and in a timely manner , grind my dogs ' nails . This is sitting in a drawer right now .	-1
I bought this to separate our cat from our recently adopted dog while they get to know each other and it worked well for a little while ... . until my cat figured out that he can break through the locking mechanisms if he tries hard enough . All he has to do is push hard enough and he 's out ! If you 're not interested in the locking part , this door will be fine for you but you can get non-locking ones for cheaper . This was easy to install , even on our hollow-core door . But I still do n't recommend for the reasons in the first paragraph .	-1
Our husky shredded this toy easily within a couple of days and we had to take it away from her . Alas , it does not hold up to hard chewers as well as some other stuffed animal toys . The belly is intact , but once the neck , arms , and legs start to unravel , the stuffing falls out . Perhaps this toy would be more durable with less aggressive chewers .	-1
first one was apart at 3 seams within the first day ( my older dog only played gently with it - he likes to suckle on stuffed toys not chew ) ... the company replaced it ( and frankly enrolled me in a pet survey group that sends me free toys every quarter - so no complaints about the company ) ... the 2nd one was the same . now that i have a little puppy that toy has more stitching from me on it than original . They do love the shape of it though ... too bad the seams are n't sturdy .	-1
Bought this door a week ago , to replace a Petsafe door , because my Maine Coon is a yr old and got too big for the other door . Would have bought a Petsafe door , loved the lock 's , ease of use , big handle on the inside and the panel was thicker , but they only make this rounded version and not large enough.The ProsEasy to install . Took about 15-20 minutes on a Metal insulated door . The Template was perfect.Being squarish , my cats have an easy time going in and out.The ConsThe locks are kinda flimsy and small . They are on the bottom and not the easiest to grab.I live in the country and racoons are always trying to get in . Sure enough last night , one tried . When I came downtstairs at 4 am , one of the 4 slides , was pushed open . Racoons are very smart . The lock part is larger on the outside of the door.The panel itself is not very thick and there is no weatherstrip between the frame and door , so I 'm not sure about he weathertight claim.The magnet to hold the flap shut is not very strong , so I can not imagine any cat getting its tail caught , as one reviewer claimed.Today , I will build a wood cover to close over the door at night . I really should n't have to do this , while I continue m search for a stronger door.If you have no nightime visitors , then this is a good door , and especially if its on an inside door , say for the cat to go to the basement for its litter box .	-1
I bought this for my puppy with great anticipation . We also purchased the treats of the same brand to go inside . Our dog ignored the toy and would n't eat the treats . Waste of money for us .	-1
I bought these snacks to put in the many Kongs I have for my numerous dogs and none of them liked the snacks as much as they like peanut butter in the Kong . I do n't know if it 's because my dogs could n't actually get the treats out because they tried initially but gave up relatively quickly . So I would n't buy these again and think I 'll stick to peanut butter .	-1
Odd smell ( not like peanut butter for sure ) and my pet does not really like them . With that smell it might be better that she does not like or eat them .	-1
In spite of what appeared to be sound packaging , many were broken . I tried using them as directed but they ended up broken off in the Kong and I had to fish out the small leftover bits . The dogs like the treats ( my dogs are not connoisseurs , to be frank ) , but I see no reason to buy them again to use with their Kongs .	-1
Not what I expected at all . My little shih Tzu does n't like them so I wasted my money . Would not recommend .	-1
My dog did n't like it . He would not eat it and I gave it to a friend that has dogs .	-1
My new puppy could not be less interested in these treats . Even before mealtime , he just walks away , Not even a sniff . I 've had to resort to pieces of hot dog , and I know that is not healthy for him , so treats are few and far between . Training just has to rely on praise .	-1
My 80 lb lab-mix liked this thing in the beginning ( it was hard for me to stuff , though ) , but started chewing off the ridges . Now he 's nibbled down the two ends . I have many MANY other Kong toys ( MANY ! ) and this one and the tug toy were , by far , the most prone to wear . Add to that the difficulty stuffing it and I do n't think I 'd buy it again .	-1
Though we would try something new and it was a mistake . Chunks were missing after the first five minutes . Sticking with the Kong Extreme .	-1
I am not sure what the purpose of this toy is , since it did not even last five minutes . The little grooves are seemingly pointless , as the kinds of treats you would stick in there ( what , like a cheese spray ? ) would end up all over your carpet.I gave the toy to my dog with the idea that it was for chewing , but she immediately broke off pieces by getting her teeth into the grooves . : ( Not for strong chewers .	-1
I bought 2 , one for each of our 1.5yr old labs - they loved it , threw it across the room , jumped on it - played for 5 mins and then destroyed/chewed away half of it - then they both slept with the half that was left . they then left them alone for 3 days and then the same all over again . - i would buy them again as you could tell the girls enjoyed them - i couldnt recommend them tho : )	-1
My dogs love the classic Kongs . I was hoping to change it up with this product , but my dogs were n't really interested . The filling was too hard for them to reach . It was even worse for me . This thing is practically impossible to clean thoroughly . This is going in the trash .	-1
I bought this for my Lab and Sharpie . They are both heavy chewers and with the Kong brand I thought it would do the trick . I was wrong . Within 5 minutes thy had already started to pull it apart . This toy was the quickest that they have destroyed a toy .	-1
My dog was n't interested in it because the opening is small and she could n't get to the treats I stuffed in it . My sons pit mix shredded it in about an hour to where the only thing left was the ring at the center with a nub on either side .	-1
I usually love Kong toys , but I was disappointed in this one . My 1-year-old Lab chewed pieces off the end within 10-15 minutes of receiving this toy , so I can not use it to entertain him while I am at work as I had hoped . At first , I was excited to see that he had to work a lot harder to get the treat out than he has to with most treat toys , and he was enjoying himself ! Once he got frustrated enough , he started taking pieces off the end , trying to get to the treat . This might be a great toy for dogs who are not aggressive chewers , keeping them entertained for a while , but it does n't work well for my doggy .	-1
Bought this product for my golden retriever and dog started chewing it and had to throw it out.Not for dogs that chew .	-1
Stuffing treats inside isnt useful as they pop out too easily . Might be fun for heavy chewers , but if not , look elsewhere .	-1
6 months ago we adopted 3 aggressive chewing puppies.Sturdy , but hard to find the right stuff to stuff it with that 's NOT made by Kong ... . it 's an outside toy now and they have fun playing & # 34 ; keep away & # 34 ; with it .	-1
I do n't like this toy . It 's an odd shape , does n't roll and a weird space for treats . You have to break the treats up to get them to fit then they just fall out ! Do n't waste your money !	-1
I bought this for my miniature poodle ( 17 lbs . ) , and it is HUGE ! He ca n't begin to open his mouth wide enough to address the `` slots '' where you put squirt cheese ! The holes in the end are wide , too ( about 1 '' ) , so it would take some mighty big kibble not to fall out ! The wrapper says 15-35 pounds ( the size is not addressed anywhere in the description for this product - that I can find ) . This toy is 3 '' in diameter and 3 '' in height . I think it 's more appropriate for a med-large dog like a dobe . I 'm sending it back.A friend gave me a `` flying saucer '' -shaped toy ( `` Busy Buddy Twist 'n Treat '' ) . The dog has to push the toy around to get the reward . The two halves unscrew , and you put kibble in it . Depending on how big the kibble pieces are , you adjust how far you screw the parts in toward each other . The first time , leave the hole open pretty much all the way so the dog can see result of his rolling it around . Dishwasher safe ( top rack ) . I do n't know if it 's available here on Amazon , but if it is , I 'm going to get a second one for my puppy . His big brother is in no way interested in sharing his ! mb	-1
I have a small dog and within minutes she had parts of this Kong toy chewed off . I purchased the Kong because of its high ratings with other consumers but it is not the item if you have a dog with sharp teeth who chews toys up in minutes .	-1
Kong products tend to be sturdy but my dog was taking off pieces ( which could have been swallowed ) within 5 minutes . Not the best thing for a dog that likes to chew . She does well with the Classic Kong toy and that has lasted over a year .	-1
I have a brutally aggressive chewer ( 35 lb springer spaniel mix ) . She rips toys apart with her incisors . She ripped the tabs off around the hole opening in a few minutes . She has not done any additional damage to the main body of the ball . I am sure the ball would be great for normal chewers , but the tabs around the hole could not stand up to my beast .	-1
I do n't know of any of my friend 's dogs who like this . They are all relatively small dogs so maybe it works better or just works for large dogs But I ca n't recommend this for a small dog	-1
This treat dispenser is terrible at dispensing treats . Most biscuits are too big for the opening and when my 45 lb . Lab bites off the end that 's ticking out , the rest of the biscuit gets stuck inside -- with no way to get it out for the dog or even me . Putting small kibble inside presents absolutely no challenge and the ball is emptied in under one minute . I would n't even consider putting food into the slots on the outside -- it would turn my floors into a sticky , sloppy nightmare.All in all , a waste of money . I would have been much better off buying the regular Kong treat stuffer toy that my puppy adores .	-1
My dog is a power chewer and this did withstand her attempts , but it 's just heavy and awful when they drop it at your feet for a toss . I finally tossed it ... into the trash and replaced it with ChuckIt products .	-1
My pitbull foster was able to chew away at this ball and left little pieces of the rubber ball all over the floor . Better him chewing the ball than my shoes , but still not for aggressive chewers !	-1
This is a terrible ball for small dogs . First , it 's not small . Second , it 's hard as a rock and heaven forbid the dog get ahead of the ball and get hit by it . They 'd be knocked unconscious . Third , it does n't bounce all that well.Summary -- This ball is not small . It 's 2 and 3/8 inches in diameter . No way my little Jackie Russell mix could get her mouth around it. -- It 's so hard it does n't bounce well. -- It 's so heavy it does n't bounce well and you could hurt someone if you hit them with it.I 'm glad it 's natural rubber , but it 's not a good play ball for throwing . I 'm going back to using the Kong squeaky balls . **Pippin the 40 pound poodle says that he likes the smell . And it 's round . These are good things . ( He likes balls ... a lot . ) But since I wo n't throw it , he 's unhappy too .	-1
The ball in the picture is not the ball I received . The ball I got was solid , without a hole through it , and extremely dense . I ordered this same ball from amazon two years ago and my dog loved it , he barely plays with this one and I ca n't toss it in the house for fear of shattering something or putting a hole in wall . Very disappointed . When you click on `` small '' the ball has a hole in it , and when you click `` med/large '' it still shows a ball with a hole in it , not a solid ball like I received . For the lose .	-1
I use it a lot f times and my cat did not recognice any difference , i left TO use it	-1
The one cat I bought this for had an odd attraction to it ( he 's a sweet oddball anyway ) ... .so I tried it on the others ( me-cat lady ) and nothing . Well that was disappointing ... * I bought this product at PetSmart ... came to Amazon looking for something that may work ... suggestion ?	-1
Although this did repel my kitten on first smell , it did n't repel her long enough -- she was back within minutes -- to bother with it when this bottle runs out . Also , I do n't like the roll-on top for this so put the liquid into a spray bottle . It 's also a repellent to me , as well . I ca n't stand the smell and do n't want to be around it . I 'm trying to keep her from scratching and prowling around places she does n't belong , not me . I 'll stick with other methods .	-1
I bought it to try and keep my cat from licking the fur off his back legs and belly . It just made him lick worse .	-1
DID NOT WORK AT ALL AND I ACCIDENTLY GOT SOME ON MY FINGER AND GOT A TASTE OF IT AND IT TASTED LIKE WATER SO I DO NOT KNOW HOW IT SHOULD TASTE TO A HUMAN ALSO THE DESCRIPTION SAYS `` SPRAY WITH DABBER '' IT HAD NO SPRAY TOP INCLUDED WHICH MADE IT HARD TO PLACE WHERE NEEDED	-1
My cat is somewhat Pica he eats fabric , so wanted to test this prodcut so I sprayed it on something he would eat and see if he starts trying to eat it , after spending some time to investigate and smell it he then started to chew on the fabric , it did not deter him from eating what he was not suppose to . I guess for me it did not work and I would not buy this product . I would like to recommend another but unfortunately I do n't know of one .	-1
This was n't a deterrent for my pit bull puppy , who chewed on everything in sight in spite of my using Bitter Apple . I think the biggest drawback is that it dries out too fast , thus quickly losing any effectiveness . Once she moved past the crazy puppy stage into reward- and praise-based obedience training , the command `` leave it '' gives me the positive result I was looking for .	-1
I got this in today 's deliveries . Applied to my lickie lickie dog ... ..yup it 's VERY bitter ... I got some ( unbeknownst to me ) on my hand and ultimately in my OWN mouth ! ! It 's awful ! ! ! 6 hours later -- -the dog has sopping wet feet as she licks them to DEATH . This stuff did n't even work for one day -- not at all ... she was so intent on licking she did n't even see me approaching ! Back to the drawing board !	-1
I was hoping to use this as a deterrent for my puppy chewing on inappropriate things but it does n't seem to work . The label on the bottle is different than some of the descriptions I read before purchasing this item .	-1
Did n't really seem to slow my 4 month old pit bull down a bit . We sprayed it on the bedpost he was leeviouy chewing on , but he went back to it again later , undeterred . Same for our shoes and slippers .	-1
My understanding is that cats should never have alcohol , ca n't believe they put it in here . I ended up just taking the table out of the room that my cat would n't stop licking and replaced it with one that does n't seem to interest her .	-1
Maybe this is only intended to work for dogs since it did n't stop my cat from chewing on my silk palm trees at all . I really drenched them down , too , every time he went out there but did n't work .	-1
It did n't work for my Aussie puppy . My dog loved the smell and licked it all , and he wanted more . Sorry , 1 star ! Note : Not all dogs are the same so my suggestion is to give it a try and it might work for your dog .	-1
It deters ... until it wears off in 30 mins or so or until my golden retriever has accidentally rubbed it off . So , to really make it work you have to constantly reapply it to whatever surface or material you want your dog to avoid . That 's tedious and a waste of money because you just have to keep buying it and applying it all the time . Save yourself the money and just be super vigilant when she is with you and reinforce with & # 34 ; NO ! & # 34 ; and giving your dog her toy in place of whatever you want her to NOT chew on . My golden used to put her mouth on everything and she pretty much only chews her toys now because that 's what I did .	-1
not a deterrent . my dogs like to lick and chew whatever this is sprayed on . make sure to do a test area before you coat your house with this or you will be sorry if they are like my obtuse dogs	-1
I knew the reviews were not all that great , but I thought I would give it a try with my puppy , since she was chewing everything she could find . Sadly , it did not work for her and I had to switch to a different brand.I loved the idea and wish and had worked , but it did NOT deter her one bit !	-1
Bought it to spray on furniture to keep my puppy from chewing on the wood . He licked it off . Not the effect I was hoping for .	-1
This item does n't work . It is like using nothing . The puppy still chewed everything . Sprayed or not . A waste of money	-1
My dog suddenly decided to chew up his wooden barred play containment area . Nothing would stop him . Until this ! This stopped his chewing immediately . And he once again decided his rawhide chews were wonderful.But then he decided he really liked this stuff , and actually increased the chewing of his pen . The center bar of his pen is now almost chewed through . I do n't know what I am going to do now !	-1
EVEN THOUGH I DID N'T BUY THE PRODUCT FROM AMAZON , I THOUGHT IT WOULD BE A GOOD DEED TO PROVIDE A REVIEW . THIS PRODUCT IS WORTHLESS . OUR 16 WEEK OLD YORKIEPOO IS NOT THE LEAST BIT TURNED OFF BY IT . SHE MUST THINK IT 'S WATER OR SOMETHING . OUR EXPERIENCE WITH THIS PRODUCT , AND OVER THE YEARS , NATURE 'S MIRACLE PRODUCTS , HAS BEEN THAT THEY ARE ALL A RIP OFF , AND FAIL TO PERFORM AS ADVERTISED . JUST ANOTHER PRODUCT FOR SALE TO SEPARATE PET OWNERS FROM THEIR MONEY . SO SAVE YOUR MONEY ; STAY AWAY FROM THESE PRODUCTS AND THEIR OUTRAGEOUS CLAIMS .	-1
the holes are too big ; will not hold purigen . fine for just carbon or large media . Weak , tears over time . i will not be purchasing again .	-1
i got this for using purigen , a renewable filter media . i got the bag that was specifically made for it and it was over 8 bucks.i thought i could save a bit of money and use this one . well i have little white purigen beads floating all over and my dumb fish is tryin gto eat them.i would use this with carbon media but nothing else . it 's not super fine and not durable.i 'm not made though , because they do n't say it was made for purigen .	-1
While this litter clumps well , I feel like I need a dust mask and goggles to clean it . With only one cleaning I feel like I have a huge buildup of dust in my lungs , so I can only imagine what is getting into my kitties ' little lungs . And there is no way this is unscented . I can smell it from across the room . Definitely not getting this again .	-1
This litter makesBoxiecat Premium Clumping Clay Cat Litter 's claim of 99.9 % dust-free justified.It produces dust like hell , both when pouring it into litter boxes and scooping litter out . It is the dustiest litter I 've used by far , more than Swheat Scoop , Boxiecat , and Integrity . What 's worse , although the box stats it 's unscented , there is always a strong trace of chemical smell left inside my mouth and throat after I cleaned litter boxes every time , and the scent would stay for more than half an hour -- -- and I wearNeoprene Carbon Mask - Multi-Purpose Dust Mask with 2 Carbon Filters and 10 External Filterswhen clearing litter boxes ! WTH ! It gives me a light headache and some coughing after clearing litter boxes.The only reasons I give it two stars are:1 . It clumps well , and2 . costs less than Boxiecat.Note : I bought mine from Pet Food Express retail store just a few days before this review . As the time of this review , on Amazon there are two types of stock photos for this product . Mine is the one with the green ribbon with gold trim on the box , which is the one Amazon uses for the smaller search result icon , and is not the other with blue ribbon and used on the product page. -- -- -- -- -Update Jan/11/2014/ -- -- -- -- After running circles on and off Amazon , I finally landed on Integrity clumping clay litter . It comes in paper bag.It produces a little bit more dust than Boxiecat , but a lot less than Ever Clean , while clumping about as good as Ever Clean . And yes , it is truly unscented.It also costs significantly less than the aforementioned two brands.It is currently not sold on Amazon , and I purchased mine from Pet Food Express , which , I believe , has buy-three-gets-the-fourth-one-free discount on this brand.- I should 've known better , since I had been using its wheat litter , which was to replace Swheat Scoop after its price-hike and maggot issue , but my faith of `` there is always something cheaper and better online '' caught me.If you 've exhausted all your options on Amazon , still not satisfied of either quality or price , and there happens to be Pet Food Express or pet shops selling Integrity nearby , give it a try.I do n't know how Integrity does it , but it has both quality and competitive pricing , like a dream comes true . ( *If anyone ever spots any `` catch '' -- harmful chemical , improper factory condition , etc , please let me know ) If you try Integrity of this review and really like it , please leave a comment , so that people know I am not the only one .	-1
This litter was without question , is the worst litter I have ever purchased . For the price I paid , I really expected an above average product . When I scoop out the waste , a cloud of dust enveloped me ... and everything else . Good thing I have surgical masks , because I will have to wear them every time I clean the cat box . To add insult to injury , the price I paid is way out of line . I will NEVER purchase this product again .	-1
Things I hate about this toy:1 . The wire . It keeps wrapping itself up and is hard to control2 . The little things attached to the wire ( they break off too easily ) 3 . The cats ( who love other toys and go crazy with stupid stuff ) will not even entertain me by playing with this toy ... they walk right by when I try to play with them with it.It is collecting dust with only one or two of those things left on it ( the rest fell off ) . I will be putting in the trash tonight now that I am thinking about it sitting on top of the table . I can honestly say it was a waste of money and also annoyed me the whole time I tried to use it because of the stupid wire thing wrapping up no matter how hard I tried to maneauver it different ways .	-1
MY CATS HAVE NO INTEREST IN THIS AT ALL . IT LOOKS LIKE A GOOD TOY BUT THEY DONT LIKE IT .	-1
Just buy this cat dancer toyCat Dancer Products Original Interactive Cat Toyand forget the wall-mount style.I thought I 'd be lazy and buy the wall-mount cat dancer - I stuck the wall-mount part of it on the back of my bedroom door and the adhesive sticks way too much ; no matter what I use to try and remove it , the residue and part of the foam will not come off the door . The cats quickly lost interest playing with it this way , they want ME to interact with them . I have more fancy moves than a stationary cat dancer mounted to a wall or door.Plus I also think it 's a bad idea to make this a toy where you do not supervise the cat 's play - the cardboard tubing eventually shreds and the bare wire can be dangerous to your cat.Original Cat Dancer : 5 starsOriginal Cat Dancer with Wall Mount : 2 stars - just use it as the original and forget the wall mount .	-1
What a joke.. if this entices your cat.. you have one in a million.. it 's horrible	-1
I missed all of the one star reviews for this product because there are so many four and five star reviews at the top . Shame on me for not clicking on one star to see what problems people were having . After playing with the cats for about half an hour ( they loved it ! ) , I put the toy on the floor . I walked into my kitchen and came right back . In that short amount of time , my cat had chewed several inches of the string off of the product and was choking on it . I ca n't imagine what would 've happened if I was n't nearby when this happened . I do n't want any cat toy in my house that could kill my cats . I used this toy for under 45 minutes and into the trash it 's going.If you think this is the toy for your cat , make sure that they can never access it without you playing it with them .	-1
This toy is potentially dangerous . I read the reviews of people claiming their cats ate part of the ribbon , but dismissed it because my 7 month old cat has never done anything like that before . I bought this for him about 2 weeks ago and although he loves it , this morning I woke up to part of the ribbon wet and slimy and in a ball on the floor . It looks like he chewed a part of it off and then threw it up . This could be really dangerous.This toy is not made well . If it was , my cat would n't have been able to chew part of it off and swallow it . It 's a cheap piece of crap and could have killed my cat .	-1
95 reviews got me . sounded wonderful ! I waited in sublime anticipation ! They ship quickly , but what do you actually get ? A long piece of fleece attached to the end of a plastic stick ! THAT 'S IT FOLKS . Either other folks got something different , or everyone is a friend of the seller . DO NOT BUY . It 's a trick .	-1
I was playing with my cat the other day and when se grabbed into it , it just broke . I was afraid she was going to choke on the pieces . Be careful and if you want a dancer try something a little more sturdy	-1
My cat chewed right through this severing it and i am not sure if she ate a piece but i will find out i guess in the next 72 hours ! My cats are not crazy over the top with energy and chewing and she literally drug it off for under a minute and had it chewed completely through . I am stressing now because she was coughing a little and i looked down her throat and saw nothing ; which means whatever was there is now hopefully going to NOT cause some bowel obstruction that will cause major issues and cost but mostly my animal 's health .	-1
The other day , while playing with this toy with my two cats , one of them ran off with it , which I thought was cute . They took it under the dining room table . A few minutes later , I put the toy away , not noticing that piece was missing . Only today I found a six inch piece of the polyester in the feces of one of them which I am amazed I found as it was well hidden ! Please supervise your cats when they play with this toy . They can chew off a piece and it it which can cause big problems . I know that some will say that cats must be supervised while playing with their toys , but sometimes they are too quick , have their backs to you , and you wo n't notice anything . Also , this type of polyester seems very strong , and may give the false impression that it is safer than it is . The reason for the one star is to hope this posts serves as a warning to others to be careful . Hopefully , more people will read a one star review prior to a purchase .	-1
I 'm not overly thrilled with this toy and my kitty , while more enthusiastic about it than I am , also feels like it could be better ( she often loses interest after a few minutes ) . The string is very long , about three and a half feet , which means a foot is dragging on the floor when I 'm playing with her while sitting down . I 'm a 6'5 '' male and even I have to hold my arm up high in order to get the tip of the string off the floor , which is the only way to really flick it around in an enticing manner . I 've started to contemplate snipping a foot or so off the end , though I 'm unsure if that will cause the string to fray and fall apart . Right now my cat usually winds up watching the tip of the plastic wand as I try to wave my arm high enough to get the end of the string going , which means a couple of tired shoulders for me and reduced playtime for her.I also worry about my little girl getting at this thing and playing with it when I 'm not around , as the end of the string is small enough for an industrious kitty to swallow and could easily knot around her neck if she 's rolling around with it.This `` cat charmer '' is higher quality than most cat toys , which I give it credit for , as I have n't had any issues with the string breaking or disconnecting from the wand . All in all it 's an okay product that could be better , and I will likely be buying other toys to replace this one before long .	-1
My cat loves this toy so so so much , but unfortunately he loves eating it too . One day I woke up and saw 7 inches of it missing . It was my fault for leaving it unattended , but it should n't be a dangerous toy if left alone to begin with . My cat did n't poop for 4 days , and we had to take him to the vet . He really misses the toy , but if possible can you guys make this ribbon more durable to tears and rips . Thank you . I really do love it , but I give it 1 star for the risk factor . My cat is okay , i digged through his poop to find it .	-1
I bought this at a local pet store after reading all the rave reviews . There were many different patterns/colors to choose from and I picked a clear purple rod with the funkiest ribbon out of the bunch . Unfortunately , my cat did n't care much for it and I had it returned and exchanged for his dependable favorites ( feather teasers ) . It would definitely help if you had a lot of space to run around with the toy but I really ca n't see how this costs so much and agree with other reviewers about this glorified string on a stick . After reading reviews of some cats who have eaten , choked , gotten sick from the toy ... well , If this toy requires as much supervision as a regular piece of string , I 'd just stick with the string as it 's 1 % of the cost of this product . Or I 'd make my own from a crafts store . I 've played with cats with long pieces of string in huge empty spaces and they go crazy for it . With the right supervision and making sure it 's never left out , it 's safe . Yes , the fabric on the Cat Charmer does get narrower at the end but that 's simple to recreate . The fabric is also harder for my cat to grasp onto ( or it might just be that he was n't trying very hard ) but I think it frustrated him more than it helped . It does indeed have a snakelike movement , but it did n't entice my kitty unfortunately which is no one but my cat 's fault . Every cat has their preference and I think the cheaper a toy is , the more my cat likes it , like wads of paper and a free mini spongy football we got from a booth .	-1
its not attached to the pole very well and rips easy..cat not interested much and its just not worth the money	-1
I have no idea why but my cats just ignore it when I try to play with it - sorry . My cats are n't real active altho fairly young	-1
Just not that interested ... . `` another string on a stick ? REALLY ? I am supposed to be thrilled with this ? Puh-leez ! '' seems to be his reaction . If I annoy him with it he 'll swat at it and walk away . It is colorful and soft though !	-1
I have four cats , only one will play with this and not very long . It is well constructed and very colorful but my cats seem to like the one with the mouse attached to it . You have to find out what your cat likes and use that .	-1
Cat does n't bother to catch it . He gets annoyed when I try to make him catch it . On the other hand he goes crazy after the & # 34 ; Da Bird Cat Catcher Cat Toy & # 34 ; . THat other toy resembles the real animal much more , so it awakens feral instincts in my cat .	-1
My cats love the toy , and I would have gave it more stars except they ate it when I was at work . You have got to hide these toys when your not around . especially hide the ones with the feathers .	-1
My older cats do n't care about it . I would like to get my money back but its $ 3 so thats it .	-1
This item is such a flimsy piece of garbage . It bends and flexes easily and cracks with minimal effort . My pit bull ripped one to shreds . If anyone knows where to buy a metal crate pan please let me know .	-1
After measuring and measuring , I thought this was the best option for our crate . Wrong ... All the other comments are right , it 's bigger than you think .	-1
I purchased a power filter 40I and it was very quiet and worked very well on my smaller aquarium , so I purchased one of these Power Filter 60s for my 55 gallon tank . It was so loud I could hear it upstairs . I have since purchased 2 more 40I filters to use in it 's place and hope to sell THIS one to some sucker on craigs list .	-1
This filter worked well for almost exactly 90 days and then it died . The pump stopped pumping like an octogenarian 's heart . It reminds me of `` Bladerunner '' when the replicants just die after a time . The same with this . Good thing filters for 10 gallon tanks are cheap . My tank is on it 's 3rd in 6 months . First was a Top Fin . Crap ! Second was this tetra whisper . Crap ! Now I have an Aqueon 10 gallon . I will hold off on reviewing that product for a couple of months .	-1
I was disappointed in the noise level that it gave out . The aquarium is in the boys ' room and i want is to be & # 34 ; quiet & # 34 ; for them at night . It has a soft hum but I felt that the hum would be to loud at night . If I had it in another room I would use it . It really is a good filter . I would recommend it if the aquariums are not in the bedrooms or if a person does n't mind the humming at night .	-1
Upon unpacking I noticed big 3 inch crack where the energizer/motor goes . It would leak immediately . So I sent it back to Amazon for an exchange.Upon inspection I noticed the plastic mold is significantly thinner at the energizer than anywhere else . It should be thicker.Tetra please go back too the stronger smoke colored filters of old . The seemed stronger . I will amend my report when I get my filter .	-1
When I bought this filter it was working perfectly and was really quite . I took my tank down and put the filter up for two months , when I set my tank back up and hook this filter back up it was extremely loud . I 've tried jiggling the intake tube , pulling it up slightly and letting it catch on it 's own instead of me forcing the impeller in place , still no luck . I do n't know why this happened but the filter started off great . Even with the loud noise it still cleans the tank well .	-1
Motor died in 2 month . I 've had aquariums for over 20 years . This should n't happen . Time to buy a new one , just not this one .	-1
The motor would n't even turn on . It was a big disappointment , and we could n't wait until Amazon could replace it .	-1
This filter does what it is supposed to , in the beginning . After 3 months of use I began having loud vibration noise from inside of the filter . I would try repositioning it and that seemed to work . Then it became more stubborn and intermittent where I would have to slap it . When slapping it failed , I had to power it off , lift the filter and remove the plastic piece that seems to be doing nothing . Then plug the unit back in and place a cloth between the tank and the filter . There must be a reason why this unit dropped in price substantially . I quickly ordered an Aquaclear Power Filter by Hagen which has several types of filtration instead of one carbon filter . World of difference.B000260FUM	-1
Do n't buy this . It 's not quiet , it does n't actually work on a 50 Gallon Tank , and it 's mucky and dirty . Hard to clean .	-1
I bought this power filter and it is totally inefficient and a waste of money . My tank water was always cloudy , smelled fishy , and my gravel was nasty ! I bought a Hagen Aquaclear and my water was sparkling within 24 hours !	-1
I bought this specifically because it said it was for 3 gallon or smaller tanks . I would n't ever expect this to work for a 5 gallon tank because it specifically says 3 or smaller . BUT I did hope that it would be ok for a 1 gallon flat sided bowl ... it 's not . I bought this to keep red rosy minnows ( feeder fish ) in for a week at a time . It has already killed 3 fish by sucking them up against the intake . There is no control over how much/little water is drawn in . I even used foam , from another pump to see if it would help . The fish are still swimming for their lives and any time they stop they get drawn against the foam . There is no way I expected it to be that strong considering what it is.On the other hand , were it not killing my fish off - it is pretty quiet . There are bubbles behind the filter which makes the top bounce and/or lift up , which another reviewer commented on , but the bubbling is still not obnoxiously loud and you can remove the lid if the clicking gets to you . The motor itself is quiet if it is n't touching anything on the sides , but I am still only giving it two stars because the motor moves around on a counter top and will sometimes move itself up against the wall or bowl and be louder until I move it back . I really wish this had worked better . For a three gallon tank , maybe it would be perfect , for a one gallon tank , it is too strong .	-1
I bought this in hopes to have a filter that is quite and keeps the tank clean . However , this would just randomly stop working and I would have to unplug it and plug it back in just after using it for 2- days . Waste of money . It kind of worked for about 1 week , and now it no longer works .	-1
i had this filter for a grand total of a week before installing a new one , i would have taken it back to the store the same day if i had another option for a filter , however i went ahead and purchased theTOM Aquarium Mini Internal Filter 45gph adjustable flowonline ( which is working perfectly by the way ) and waited for delivery . so why is this filter so horrible ? 1 ) the noise is unbearable , this tiny filter for a 3 gallon tank is louder than another filter i have for a 75 gallon tank ! unbelievable2 ) its made of cheap plastic parts , ( the `` lid '' broke off during assembly ) the ONLY good thing about this filter is the fact that it is gentle the current is very weak , suitable for my delicate finned male betta.as for as how it does with actual filtration , for the week i had it , it kept the water clear and well circulated ; as far as any long term use i would n't know about but honestly in my opinion i would n't be surprised if this thing did n't last more than a month , its that flimsy .	-1
This filter is the worst . First problem I had with it is that the airpump 's shape is not designed to handle its own vibration . If placed on a wooden surface it will slide until it encounters an object and when it bumps into the object it will make a loud obnoxious noise . So I placed it on some paper towels and it finally stayed in place . Still , this filter was making more noise than the filter I use in my 20 gallon tank.I put this one in a 2.5 gallon betta tank and after a week I noticed lots of debris floating around in the water which should n't be there if you 're using a filter . I also noticed that the water flowing out of the filter was down to a trickle . After just ONE week . Apparently the airpump is n't strong enough and loses its ability to function in a week . By the end of week 2 NO water was flowing out of the filter . This filter was a complete waste of money . Seriously , do not buy it.For anyone who has one of these and finds that it no longer works , here 's what you can do with that useless airpump . Use it for a small airstone . That 's the only thing it will work for . That 's what I did for a while until I got sick of the noise and just ordered a new airpump that is ten times quieter than this thing .	-1
I have the 1 to 3 gallon smallest Whisper.I bought it for a vintage battery tank aquarium that only holds about 1.5 gallons.It 's just a dribble . And there is no way to adjust the height and my battery tank is very shallow.It works but I ca n't say it 's that effective . My advice is to look for something else and pass on this .	-1
I bought this for my 2.5 gal tank with cherry shrimp in it . I did n't want a strong current filter and risk them getting caught in it . However , the trade off is that it does n't do a very good job of keeping the ammonia levels down . I 'm doing a pwc about every other day just to get them under control . Unlike my bigger tank with the bigger filter I ca n't custom make the tiny and inadequate cartridges , namely to put ammonia crystals in it.2 stars because it does function but it just ca n't handle my tank.I 'll be looking for a different filter .	-1
I am really looking forward to receive this merchandise . When I open the box , one of the clip is missing . What a bummer .	-1
Go to a crafts store and get a giant mat of cotton and cut it yourself . use it in your fish tank and the cotton you cut yourself will remove more material . and make your water much clearer . not to mention one bag of cotton from the crafts store will last about 10Xs as long as these crappy bio bags . The carbon that comes with these bags are completely useless unlesss your using it in a canister filer.DONT WASTE YOUR MONEY . BUY COTTON FROM A CRAFTS STORE AND CUT YOUR OWN .	-1
We 've had a lot of plastic crates over the years and this one is one of the worst . It does not have ventilation in the back as shown in the picture . It also has a new turning type door closure that I do n't care for - also not shown in the picture . The way this new door is installed , it narrows the crate entrance by at least 25-30 % . The measurements list it as 48 '' long , but the interior floor where the dog lays is just under 40 '' ! Would not buy this crate again , but it 's size and weight make it difficult to return . This was an expensive mistake .	-1
I got this to replace a # 700 Petmate Classic Kennel , an economy model that I paid less than $ 100 for . My Newfoundland puppy seems to prefer plastic crates to our existing wire ones , so I decided to buy the most inexpensive # 700 as I knew it would not fit her for very long . She is now 5 months and almost 70 pounds , so it was time to get the biggest ( # 900 ) crate . The Petmate Classic was lightweight and had a reversible door , so I could set it to open at the side that fit our house.This crate was very heavy and I thought for over $ 200 it would be well made . My first disappointment was when I found that the door could only be opened in one direction ( handle at right and hinge at left ) . The closing mechanism is a circular knob . My dog is not at all rambunctious and likes being in her crate , so I was surprised to come home one day and find that she had let herself out . The closing pins do n't automatically go into the holes . I thought I had wiggled everything correctly , but I must have not . There is also a locking pin , which I need to turn the light on to release . I liked the Petmate Classic where I could just squeeze the clasp and let her out at night without waking myself up too much.The vents are not very big and she seems to get hotter in this than her old crate . There is also already a small dent in the floor , which surprised me as she is still so small . There are no dents in the outgrown crate.I am not at all impressed with this crate . If it was n't such a hassle I would return it . As it is , I will probably keep my eye out for a better crate or try the wire ones again and donate this to the local animal shelter . The color and size are good , but the quality and ease of use are poor .	-1
I spent more money on these than anything else I ever bought for my fish and I never even got to use them correctly . My tank was never clean for more than a day , and I did everything to fix it . A new filter ended up being the solution .	-1
I 've read all the reviews for this product and am I the only one who thinks these filter cartridges are garbage ? The Whisper filters themselves are great , but the cartridges are so flimsy and thin that I ca n't have one in my tank without it tearing apart or coming loose from the clip that 's supposed to hold it in place , and then all the carbon pours out all over my tank ! I do n't understand it because they 're pretty much fool proof to put together and I ca n't imagine that I 'm doing it wrong , but the darn things break every time and make a mess of my aquarium ! This does n't happen immediately , but it does happen pretty soon after I replace the cartridge for a new one ... it seems to be pretty much as soon as it gets wet and starts filtering the gunk that it breaks . no idea what 's going on ! It 's very annoying though and I 've had to stop using them .	-1
This is the worst purchase that I have made thru Amazon . It would not go together as the instructions indicated . I had to go buy four screws and nuts to put it together . I have never returned a product to Amazon , This product I would have , but I had to go pickup a new puppy the next morning and I had to use the kennel and I would never return a used product . Amazon should check to see what this company actually ships out to it 's customers and not a sample a salesman brings to he office for your buyer to look at .	-1
Pros : floats , suction cup is great , Food no longer floats off and gets pushed down by the filter 's waterfall , so less food is wasted and the filter cartridge can be changed less . Looks niceCons : cheaper at petsmart.-edit-fish dont eat from it , the uneaten food will grow mold/fungus at the water surface.It 's a 5 star product but I gave it 3 because it 's overpriced.-edit- its overpriced and does n't work for my fish and thus a 2 star product.-Edit- The fish dont seem to eat from the ring , and eventually the food grew mold/fungus . At first I thought I was overfeeding the fish , but then I realized that they only ate what was falling to the bottom , everything floating wasnt eaten . I started to feed the fish without the ring and they now come to the surface , maybe later I will try this again . -edit- I highy doubt I will ever use this again , but it remains in my tank because it looks cool .	-1
its a pain to clean , 10 gal tank its way to way out there from lid to get the food in sorry do n't like for my 10 gal tank . I bought same one for 35 gal its ok I rather tossed the food in .	-1
We have 3 PREVIOUSLY PURCHASED Petmate Deluxe Vari Kennels and they are solid , well constructed , and of excellent quality . The one my husband just ordered on Amazon was extremely flimsy , poorly constructed , has inadequate closure clips of top to bottom , has stiff and insecure latching system , and is a hideous lime green ( think 1970s ) instead of the moss green as described . I would n't trust this to securely keep a 2 pound dog safe and secure . Frankly , this looks , feels , and functions like a cheap knockoff . Returning this immediately - could not possibly be more disappointed with the poor quality of workmanship , materials , or function . And the hideous color was just icing on the cake ! Would rate it ZERO STARS if that were an option .	-1
Total waste of money it will actually make your water worse . This product should be refined to better quality . I would not recommend this product .	-1
We have 2 gold fish in a 10 gallon tank . Water gets cloudy , this product has failed to work . I have changed water , filter media , etc and started from scratch , water still gets cloudy . Just does n't work at all in my application .	-1
This is not a good product to use in taller tanks . It killed a few of my fish . Doing regular water changes is better than a chemical substitute . This bottle is very large and will probably be sitting in my supplies cabinet forever . Will not purchase this item again .	-1
killed all my fish in one day ..killed 2 beautiful healthy breeding pearl angels that were prolific breeders and very healthy and large . I only added this to try and make sure ph was stable and nitrates were low . also killed 2 large healthy flying fox . devastating .	-1
again another product that is n't cheap and does n't do what it says it should . does n't help reduce the nitrate levels at all and when the PH needs to be regulated it does n't do anything . Wo n't buy again .	-1
I got this product to help my ph level stay at the correct level . However after one of my water changes my tank 's ph level plummeted to the far acidic side . I used this product twice in a 24 hr period and it did nothing to my ph level . It is also yellow in color which colored and clouded up my water . I have a 55 gal tank which meant I had to use quite a bit of this product ... in the end product did not work and I lost 5 fish .	-1
My fish seem to love this food and it certainly ~seems~ to have `` more '' compacted into these little crisps than any old flakes.. but I think the `` less waste '' advertisement is a play on words and most definitely false . The fish are able to eat less and be satisfied , no extra flakes laying around the tank-yes- but for whatever reason after a week or so my 65 gallon tank was very cloudy . I changed the filters and the problem just continued to worsen . Water change- cloudy again within just over a week.Never a problem before . The only thing that has changed is the food . So , obviously..	-1
I ordered this expecting the item in the picture- the blue one . I received a tan one ( I actually ordered two of them ) but did n't think much of it until I started using them . ( I assumed it was just a color difference & I did n't check it until today . The one pictured has a larger opening for the food to drop out . I actually took a hacksaw to one of mine yesterday & made the opening about 1/2 '' bigger but it did n't help.Shaking the thing does n't help with the smaller or modified opening ; I have to stick my fingers in to get food out ! I 've contacted the seller ( Two 2 Tango ) & hope they will replace these with the blue one ... and I hope that one works better .	-1
Funny , my husband opened this package for our bulldog and when he dropped it for our dog to play with outside it landed like a piece of lead and our bulldog who is CRAZY for balls lost interest in two minutes .	-1
Sorry . I wanted to give it a better review , but it really was a waste of money . It 's a very hard ball . My 3 Siberian Huskies and my Lab mix will `` NOT '' play with ball . They have NO interest in it . It just sits in the yard . My dogs prefer the 8 '' Teaser ball so I am here to order another 8 '' Teaser ball .	-1
She tried it once and that was it . Not interested in it at all . My dog likes balls that she can get in her mouth or squeak . I wanted this because it was sturdy and hard to chew but she did n't play with it at all .	-1
I bought this for my 50 lb . Lab Puppy . The pup demolishes tennis balls , and all sorts of durable rubber chew toys so thought this ball would keep him entertained and yet be long-lasting . Well , it sure was a big ole plastic orange ball . It reminded me of a bowling ball ... . actually pretty heavy and the slowest rolling ball I 've ever seen . We rolled it on a hardwood floor and it was not very fun for the dog . It does n't bounce , it 's loud , it 's slow ... It just was n't for us .	-1
My GSD was ball obsessed and loved her & # 34 ; indestructible & # 34 ; ball . This was many years ago when they first came out . She played with it every chance she got , batting it the length of the long yard using her paws , muscle and teeth . And wore her teeth down in the process , blunting them . I was horrified as no one had every said anything about that possibility . I did n't even realize they were still making these things ! I thought surely by now enough dogs would have suffered similar circumstances that people would have been wary of them . Mine could n't have been the only dog whose teeth were damaged -- though of course the company that sold me the ball was n't interested in hearing about that .	-1
My 2 year old boxer-pitty does n't like this ball . It 's too big . He showed his disgust for the ball in the way that only a dog can .	-1
Purchased this product because I read reviews from dog owners of large breeds whose dogs found enjoyment . We have a pitbull who loves to play with the soccer ball . She does n't like this ball at all . She does n't even want to play with it . I do n't know if it 's the sound or her inability to grab a hold of it . But I will end this review with buy at your own risk	-1
I bought this ball for my hyper lab and mixed terrier . They played with it at most for a few minutes only and now the ball is just collecting dust in the back yard . They showed no interest playing with the ball . So I ca n't really comment on how indestructible this ball can be .	-1
its hard and my dog would not come near it . Be careful not to break your leg trying to kick it .	-1
I tried the Dooley 3000 septic system , and had it installed as per the directions exactly ... however , the soil here did not cooperate . So not only does it not work , more than once I 've found the thing open and stinking since , even though it is out of the way , the lid is easily stepped on when they are playing in the yard and charging around . Now I am going to have my yard guy fill it in or cover it up in some way since I ca n't imagine how to get it OUT of the ground at this point ... which also makes returning it rather impossible.If you are on a sewer line , I 'd recommend the Doggie Doo Drain instead , also available from Amazon , and at $ 44bucks , it 's cheaper and works a treat . Especially if you have heavy clay soil with poor drainage as was my case , or live in cold climates ... it works ALL YEAR ROUND . An added plus is that it does not require enzymes or ongoing maintenance whatsoever . I have two large labs and keeping their yard ready for play has never been easier .	-1
We have had the system in place for a couple of months now . I followed all of the instructions and at first it seemed to work great . Unfortunately our soil is n't allowing for proper drainage and now it is backed up and overflowing onto the grass . It 's a big stinky mess at this point .	-1
I 'm befuddled by the positive reviews of this product ! It picked up NO hair from ANY surface I tried it on . Not upholstery , not carpets , not leather , nothing . Maybe there is a single , magical kind of upholstery fabric it works on , but whatever it is , I do n't have it in my house.Sticky rollers and vacuums may be a hassle , but at least they work !	-1
junk ... wait.. its total garbage junk.we have microfiber . our cat and dogs , who arent allowed on them , sometimes sneak a nap on it . so what i usually have to do is take my hand and swipe quickly so the friction will get the hair up.this i saw and ordered . im returning it asap.it didnt get ANYthing up . they are failr new couches , not damaged and this thing doesnt work.if it was that soft plyable rubber on it instead of that odd hard rubber i think it would be great.oh well . glad i can return .	-1
The product just does not work . I 'm sure if I laid a garment or curtain on a flat surface and tied it down so that it was stretched out and could n't wrinkle ... it may work ... but that is just too much trouble . I 'm sticking with pet-grade paper link rollers from scotch !	-1
I agree with the users who gave this one star -- this just does NOT work to pick up hair . I have long-haired cats that have soft hair that clings to the furniture ( and everything else ) . I bought this to clean the furniture , and it does nothing . Do not buy this .	-1
~Returning this piece of junk ! Sad that it did NOT WORK as it would have been a dream come true with my beautiful ( very ) long fine haired dog I have.The thing is well made , it feels of good heavy duty plastic with a good grip ... IT JUST DOES N'T PICK UP HAIR , not the cat 's fur either.If it did work ... it should have came with a hole in it so it could be hung up.I had planned on drilling a hole in it so I could hang it in the laundry room ... BUT SINCE IT DID N'T WORK there was no need .	-1
This thermometer is always 2 degrees off . I used it for a long time , thinking it was accurate and I thought my stick on the glass was off . Turns out the stick on was right on . My heater that shows the temp and my temp probe from my DA Reefkeeper Litewere right in line with that cheap little stick on . The Coralife was off by 2 degrees . It is now on my top off tank , not as critical .	-1
Save your money here people . Purchased 6 months ago and temps are 2'F to 4'F depending on the day . Purchased another and returned it with the same results . Product is cheaply made and suction cups fail in 3 months . The product is a good idea though . ** I highly recommend for a few dollars more and your water change water will be temperature matched up , is the `` Taylor 9842 Commercial Waterproof Digital Thermometer '' $ 13.95 . Amazon # B00009WE45** This thermometer is food grade and waterproof . The temp range is -40'F to +400'F and is accurate to 1/8F of of ONE degree . My Taylor has been in aquarium service for 1.5 years now and have only replaced the battery once . Thermometer autocratically times off in 5 minutes . ** Purchase the `` Marina Floating Thermometer with Suction Cup '' # 11201 Amazon # B0002AQITK For $ 5.49 and use as reference only.You will find that matched up water temp will be less stressful to your fish , none of my fish have died in over a year and it will become an addiction to match your water to near perfect tank temps and will save big in the long run from fish NOT dying of stress related issues . FOR $ 19.44 you get TWO nice thermometers.ENJOYJohn A 60107AKA `` The Cichlid King ''	-1
Only lasted one month . Very cheaply made . Just started turning on and off . I am guessing it got a short somewhere in the really thin wire compared to its replacementHDE LCD Fish Tank Thermometer . Wasted my money .	-1
Right now it 's 82 degrees in my tank , and this thermometer shows 72 . Could not recommend , it will kill your fish .	-1
This product is great if you want a digital thermometer , but accuracy is n't important . If you do , for some crazy reason , want it to be accurate , try another brand . The only good point is that , while it is wrong , it is consistently wrong , so at least you will know if there is a temperature fluctuation .	-1
Open the package , removed the battery protective tape and nothing worked . Terrible DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT adsfeafaefaef ewqf eewa	-1
I really wanted to like this thermometer , but it did not live up to my expectations . The battery door on the back of the display pops off frequently . The suction cup that holds the display to the outside of the aquarium does not stay attached to the tank , which causes the display to drop and slam into the wall , or whatever is behind the tank . I really like the idea of this thermometer , but the design could use some improvement .	-1
Multiple mercury thermometers , my heater and one other digital thermometer all verify that this is 5 degrees off ! 5 degrees too low.This product sells under lots of different names , but the little logo under the screen matches mine . I got it at Petco . I would n't recommend any of them , they are all clearly made by the same company even though they are all branded different.Unfortunately if you do n't want to spend a lot you really should just stick to mercury thermometers . I ca n't find a reliable digital one on amazon at all .	-1
I bought this thermometer at my local fish shop and can say personally that it is so poorly constructed that the temperatures fluctuate from 2-20 degrees . Coral and tropical fish thrive in 78-80 , I was running my tank at 70-90.For 2 years this thermometer has been giving me inaccurate readings without me being able to tell . I would have tank crashes that were completely unexplained , perfect water levels and everything . Turns out because Coralife is to cheap to care about their product , I was slowly cooking my coral and fish alive half the time and freezing them the over half.Because of Coralife 's unscrupulous practices with products like this , I am not spending another dime on their products and warning my friends away . They are lucky to not be sued ( and this is not my first coralife product to damage my tanks and pets ) !	-1
If you are accustomed to pack walking your dogs this leash will do nothing for you . I bought it on a lark . In a pack walk both ( or multiple dogs ) walk in groups . On the odd occassion one may have trouble going to the bathroom , the other dog can pull on it without your control . Impractical product ... unless your dogs are n't trained to pack walk , then it might be useful.Loops 2 Double Handle Nylon Leash , 6-Foot , Blue	-1
This cheap piece of plastic falls off the kennel door at the first bump . If your pet is going on a short flight and you need to satisfy the travel requirement , this will do . If you have any concern that your pet may become dehydrated , either keep shopping of break out the gaffers tape and bailing wire .	-1
it should be for a bird cage . much too small for even a pupy . tabs broke off when i tried to fasten to kenel	-1
I bought this before my first trip with my two cats being placed in the belly of the aircraft on a trip to Florida . First of all , Delta puts their own stickers all over the kennel , so you do n't need the Live Animal Stickers . The food/water trays are useless , and the paper I could have got from a brown paper bag from the grocery store . I wasted my money on this one .	-1
not enough bubles	-1
I put this in my tank and most the air came out between where the hose hooks on and the flexable part . I 'm trying to silicone it to stop it from leaking there and see how long it lasts but I will not ever buy another one	-1
Do n't waste your money or time waiting for it to be delivered . I bought an extra air pump , and nothing happened ... no bubble at all.q I do not recommend this for your aquarium . A small cylinder airstone works better than this does . Now , I have to buy a long airstone , and redo my tank.it looked like a good idea , but ended up in disappointed afterwards . I think I should get either a refund , or a bubble wand 2 of them totaling 2 feet . I have a 30 gallon tank.Too bad to see a product , that after I read the negative feedback on , and ou still have this in stock to see to another customer only to find it does not work . Tis is what I would consider as a scam . That 's like buying a car , and it wo n't start when it arrived .	-1
Just go to WalMart and buy the SmartyKat - cheaper , faster and BETTER ! ! Ca n't believe we waited almost TWO WEEKS to get this junk -it is so IMpotent , both cats could n't care less for it !	-1
I was excited to find something that would combat my dog 's terrible breath , and once I added it to her water , she drank it with no problem . However , the next day , she had explosive diarrhea that lasted into the night . I had to get up every 1-2hours to let her out , and you could tell she felt terrible . Poor thing !	-1
This product may freshen your dog 's breath slightly , but dogs get bad breath for the same reason humans do - bacteria build up in the mouth.My dog has truly awful teeth , which are covered with plaque within minutes of a cleaning . I bought this product in hopes that it would help keep his teeth clean . I have used it faithfully every day for several months , and I can say with some confidence that it makes no difference . If you really want your dog to have healthy , clean teeth , you will have to suck it up and brush them . CET makes excellent products for pet dental care .	-1
i used this daily and it did not work at all . I thought by the end of the bottle it would take effect and then buy more but still had the bad breath	-1
My dogs ended up with severe diarrhea at the same time after I added this to their water bowl following instructions .	-1
We did not notice a difference with our dogs teeth or breath . I do n't think that we would purchase this product again , we had more luck with Teddy 's oral care for dogs .	-1
Did n't see much difference after using for about a month . Dogs would drink the water just fine with this in it but their breath was not really any & # 34 ; better & # 34 ;	-1
I put this in my dogs water dish and the next day his bark sounded as if he had a sore throat . I do n't know whether or not he did , but his normal full bark returned after I dumped out his water dish and replaced it with clean regular filtered water . Too scary for me . Have n't used it since , have n't heard any funny sounding barking since . Not worth it in my opinion .	-1
My cat will not drink the water if this is in it unfortunately . So now it just sits there un used	-1
Product did not work for my cats . They would drink the water but I did not see any results . Try at your own risk and see for yourself .	-1

I 've noticed my dog Max gets dirty faster when I use this . He has very fine hair , so maybe that 's why . I finally went back to using a shampoo/conditioner product.Maybe it works better on some dogs than others .	-1
it never worked , a fluval 405 has the same system , but better ingridents , in the chemical biologcal system n the fluval , I reccomned not to get this filter , all those revjews it worked for them but will suck later , do n't get it . Purchase a even stronger filter fluval 405 then this , 59.99 at petco ? ? 39.99 here ? ? ? waste of my dad 's money whisper and aqueon , even fluval is better	-1
This is a nice little product , but It is not that simple.I am not using 1 of these in my turtle tank , but more on that later.The 2 of these I am using are in : 1 in a 30 gallon long tank 1/2 land water for dart frogs . and 1 in a 55 gallon long 1/2 land water for fire-belly toads.they do work nice with in reason.Their suction power quite frankly is weak at best and I use both of them with lift pumps , a lift pump is any sump pump you place on the tank bottom and use to raise water up to these units to suck in.Because of this you have to make sure your left pumps are up to the task of delivering the waste and water.I am using 2 different pumps 1 is made in the usa is rated 35 gph with a lift of 2 1/2 feet but it is only 18 inches to the top of the dart frog tank and it works great plenty of pressure.The other pump I got from some place in china , it is rated at 93 gph with a lift height of 4 1/2 feet , but can hardly hold the same pressure as the pump made in the usa . go figure ... ... ... ... .It should also be noted the the suction cups that are included seem to be some kind of bad joke and I ended up getting turtle dock replacement cups and made them work instead , and they hold the tubing great in comparison.Now why did I not use 1 in the turtles tank , well to be quite frank.With all things considered , including the fact that I operate a reptile and amphibian refuge center.That I support on my disability from the navy , since I have gotten just about no donations , I have to look at the cost of the product , how well it is going to work not to mention any and all support parts I have to use to make it work the way it should.So I figured what the hey I would ask zoo med if they wanted to donate 1 to mr. turtle for the refuge center.They of course wanted no part of donating such a expensive product ' rolls eyes ' , since it of course makes much more sense from a corporate stand point to put that 35 dollars into advertising to try to make them self 's look good or put it into some executives pocket , rather then even spend it in design to make the product work up to specks never mind donate it to a turtle who was dropped off at the refuge center in need of a home.and if that makes zoomed sound like not the best corporation out their , Oh well ... all I can say , is the truth is the truth and it is what it is.in the end mr.turtle got the other turtle filter I reviewed made by a different company .	-1
I bought this filter after reading the mixed reviews , I side with the people that find it does not work well . I wish I could return it . I also agree with the using regular charcoal chips instead of buying the premade smooth bags , helps it work better but I am still changing water every few days due to odor and mess .	-1
The packaging was damaged , so I had to take the advice of others & use a different carbon bag right from the start.This filter worked well for about four weeks , but fails to move water effectively after that . I used the 501 in a 35-gallon long aquarium with less than 12 gallons in it . I clean the tank and pump thoroughly each week , so I know that the issue is not that it 's clogged . I 've got a trickle of water still , even after cleaning the sponge , filter , hoses and pump.My 2 '' ( RES ) baby turtle loved the waterfall while it lasted , but I will be buying a replacement just 2.5 months after initial purchase . I 'm kicking myself for not keeping the packaging materials , because I would have definately sent it back- turtle gunk & all . There are many other filters with better reviews and results for less than the price of this one.I gave it one star because I did n't see an option for zero stars . It 's a WASTE ( of time & money ) , no pun intended !	-1
this filter is the biggest piece of trash i have ever used . i use it in a 20 gallon tank with 1 turtle half full of water . within 2 days i need to do a full water change . even using better carbon , it doesnt help . i am hoping to return it when my new filter arrives.i had a 25 dollar internal filter that did far better then this junk .	-1
My German shepherd hates this brush ! She runs away the moment she sees I have it ... It may be easy clean up ... but something about it will make em run ... I suggest to keep looking.. I know I am now looking for a new one ... . perhaps a rubber based one like the groomers reccommended ...	-1
I purchased the Sherpa Original Deluxe Pet Carrier , Medium , Black and just used it for the first time to transport my cat to the vet . During this first use , the mesh on the bag developed a rip , despite the fact that my cat was shockingly calm during transit and did n't attack the bag at all . My cat is 12 pounds - well within the weight range for this product and one trip is hardly excessive usage . This is supposed to be a quality product and I 'm very disapointed that instead it 's damaged after a single , non-intensive use . I 'm concerned that it wo n't be secure to carry my pet during an international flight , which was the reason I purchased it . Although the top and side openings proved useful , I just ca n't trust a product that breaks immediately .	-1
Expensive , and not at all durable . Used this for transporting a 10 lb . puppy ... .but he tore a hole in it halfway through the flight . I 'm sure it 's effective for animals who enjoy being packed into a small space , but I really wish I would have spent less and bought something more durable .	-1
May be on really mated long haired cat it would take some hair out , but I have 2 cats , short and medium hair , and did n't take ANY hair out from either one of them . I 'm returning it !	-1
I was extremely disappointed in this carrier and should have paid more attention to the negative reviews already on amazon and not just all the positive reviews.I was very excited to be getting a carrier with wheels as I foster cats and often have to juggle two or more carriers when taking them to the adoption clinics - this carrier seemed like a perfect solution.The first carrier I ordered I had to return because the zipper was broken on the entry door - when you zipped it up the teeth did not stay together . I sent the product back to amazon with no worries and requested a replacement . Sadly the replacement also had multiple zipper issues . Not only are a couple of the zippers not closing they are some of the hardest to slide zipper 's I 've ever encountered . Even if they were working properly this would be a difficult carrier to use as the zippers are so difficult I ca n't imagine getting this bag closed with a struggling pet.I second many of the other criticisms of this product - bad zippers , flimsy small wheels , and very unbalanced . Back it goes to Amazon and I will have to keep looking ... .	-1
The very first time i used this carrier , I put my cat into the carrier through the side and zipped it up . About a minute later as I was heading to my front door , to my horror , my cat jumped out of the front of the carrier . The zipper was broken and off the teeth and my cat bolted out . Fortunately I was still in my home . I do not want to think about what would have occurred in 30 seconds later as I left my house into the street -- my cat would have been lost . First time used out of the box this is what happens ? ? ? To say that I am angry is an understatement . I do not trust this product and now am being told i need to file for an exchange . This was an expensive carrier and an exchange is not what i have in mind as I will not be able to trust that this will not happen again . My cats are my family and I care and protect them and that means not putting them at risk by using products that have been defective .	-1
My dog is a 90lb black lab mix . She typically does not chew on toys . She prefers squeaky toys to any other toy . I decided to buy her this to just give it a try . The perk is she does like it , however after barely any time there is already a hole in it . I was hoping the tire would last more than 10 minutes without worrying about small pieces being scattered around the house . If your dog is n't that great of a chewer then I would recommend this . However if you have a huge dog like myself then go for those slightly pricier toys which last months rather than minutes .	-1
Missing the part that hooks to the hose . Cheaply made , very disppointed ! Would not recommend . Disappointed beyond words . Toll free customer service on package dies n't work . Wow	-1
After just under 1 year , this thing is completely useless.Two major problems:1 ) overflow has not worked properly for last 4 months . It uses a simple float mechanism ( like a toilet ) to stop , which does not properly shut off . We were able to fix it for a few months , but it overflows badly now.2 ) The other problem is that if you have large dogs with large paws , you will probably want to mount this since 1 ) it 's plastic , thus edible , and 2 ) they swim in their dishes . The problem is the mount holes are also plastic and the bowl is now tearing away from the weight of the water.Minor problems:1 ) Fittings are plastic - so it leaks - copious amounts of patience and plumber 's tape will do the trick2 ) No drain hole3 ) Some of inner fittings have corroded ( clearly a local problem ) Pros:1 ) Price2 ) Color3 ) It did n't crack or discolor from the sunBottom line : I can not recommend it .	-1
This waterer is too plastic . The plastic coupling is not good and will fail . Additionally , the chemicals in this plastic will leach into your dog 's water , especially if it is in the sun . I thew this one away and got the stainless steel one . It is bigger but actually an ideal size for large and small dogs and although the valve system is plastic , the basin is stainless steel . I also bought the recommeded extra hose coupling ( recommended by Amazon in the `` customers who bought this also bought this '' section ) which makes the hook-up water tight and easy .	-1
We bought this cage for our 2 Guinea pigs , ages 1 and 4 , after seeing the customer images of it with G. pigs and reading some of the reviews . This cage is not for Guinea pigs . The ramps are too steep , even with the shelves set at their lowest level . Their little stubby legs and bodies ca n't go up them and the only way they can get down is to slide . The floor area is adequate for G. pigs - however , since I am not going to use the shelves and ramps , the cage is awkwardly tall . It is also too low to the ground . I am going to move them back to their old cage which is on legs and has a larger floor space . All in all , as a G. pig owner , I am very disappointed in this purchase . It would be nice for a ferret , as pictured on the box . However , for G. pigs , it is not a good cage at all .	-1
only 1 of my 2 cats have shown any interest at all in these mylar toys . Shes attracted to the crinkle sound right before i throw it but they dont go very far cause they 're so light + they stop moving almost immediately when they hit the floor so she loses interest pretty quickly . As with most cat toys , you just never know until u get it home . 1 cats treasure is another cats yawn .	-1
CAT had absolutely no interest in it . Waste of money and materials . She ignores and I wonder if the material it is made of is the problem .	-1
Maybe its cat dependent , but my kitten could not care less about these . She is VERY playful and I would have thought the crinkly texture would be appealing , but I ca n't seem to interest her in these ( note : she also does n't care for little mice at all either and prefers toys with a little more challenge . For example she loves the leopard den kitty teaser ) .	-1
My cat hates the noise it makes as much as she is indifferent to the toy . I had such high hopes with the other rave reviews but found this to be another collosal waste . the only toys she 's liked are the zany mice , real laser pointer , and the wand with the long pice of flannes .	-1
I have a thin , elderly cat and a young fat cat -- neither of them were impressed with these mylar balls . They just swatted them once and walked away . Oh well .	-1
Sorry , but my kitty had no interest . Maybe good for other kitties , but mine just let them sit on the floor undisturbed , collecting dust until I threw them away ...	-1
I have some of these in the Mini , or Small size . These are sort of medium sized , and my cats do not play with them as they do the smaller ones	-1
My cat never plays with these crinkle balls - ever . Was a complete waste of money and I 'm glad I did n't spend much on them .	-1
Size : Pros : this cage should not be used as the primary habitat for any mouse , gerbil , hamster , rat , Guinness pig , or rabbit . It is way too small even for one mouse . It could be used as an add on cage . Mice need 144 inches per mouse and Syrian hamsters need at least 360 inches.Cons : If you have female mice , you will need at least two cages because you need at least two female mice . Thus , this cage could be your second cage if your first is big enough.Wheel : Cons : This wheel is way too small an will result in back and neck injury which will lead to a painful life and early death . Minimum wheel requirement for mice is 6.5 inches and for Syrian hamsters , minimum is 6 inches with 11 recommended.Pros : solid , so no risk of injury to feet or tails.Safety : Pros : The spacing on the bars is ideal to ensure hamsters and mice stay in . ( 1/4 inch on these , & # 60 ; 1/2 inch guideline. ) . The door is also secure with a spring based locking mechanism.Cons : There is very little viewing space because the cage is only 10 inches tall and the bottom and top plastic take up 5 of those inches.Smell and sanitation : Pros : The wire cages produce adequate ventilation to both keep mice healthy and reduce odor from urine.Cons : they like to chew on the metal bars , which are bad for their teeth and that plastic coating ca n't be good for their health . Thus , it is important to get them as many chew toys as possible . Rocks and sticks from the garden frozen for 24 hours work as well as purchased lava rocks for teeth nawing purposes.Cleaning : All pros : the cage is quick and easy to clean . It disassembles and reassembles in minutes . A bit of dish soap or vinegar and water clean it right up.Compatibility : This cage is compatible with habitrail , with a couple of notes : For the most part , the habitrail pieces can not connect directly to the cages because the pieces fit on just fine , but are n't snug and will fall off with even the slightest jarring . That said , the habitrail pods and cubes will connect to the crittertail cages directly . All other Habitrail pieces can connect to crittertrail funnels that connect to the crittertail cages.I hope this review has been helpful to you .	-1
Size : Pros : This cage is great as an add on cage to provide extra room.Cons : It I not big enough even for one mouse . The floor space is about 90 inches . One mouse needs 144 inches to live without illness . If you have female mice , you will need at least two cages ( and the other one should be at least 200 square inches ) because you need at least two female mice . Syrian hamsters need at least 360 inches of floor space so you would need four of these cages ( or this cage plus 270 inches in other cages ) .Wheel : Pros : This wheel is solid , so there I no risk of feet or tails being caught and broken , which often leads to a loss of limb and death ( besides ring very painful ) .Cons : This wheel is too small even for a mouse . Mice need wheels that are at least 6.5 inches in diameter in order to avoid back and neck injury ( also very painful and leading to early death ) . Syrian hamsters need an 8 inch wheel minimum , but 11 is preferable.Safety : Pros : The spacing on the bars is ideal to ensure hamsters and mice stay in . ( 1/4 inch on these , & # 60 ; 1/2 inch guideline. ) .

I would not recommend this cage as it is very hard to clean and the running wheel on top is not as cool as you thought . The wheel oftenly stuck and wont turn on its rail . Things are hard to take apart for cleaning .	-1
The is the worst cage I have ever owned for a hamster . Putting it together is a nightmare ... if parts are n't exactly where they need to be , it will appear to be assembled correctly until you slightly bump it and everything falls apart ( resulting in your little critter escaping if you are not nearby to see ) . The wheel is loud and has little drain holes for poo & pee to leak out , but the part underneath to capture it does n't do a good job and it all winds up everywhere . The water bottle that came with it leaked . The door is nearly impossible to latch without using excessive force ( thought this would get easier as it got broken in , but no ) . The top compartment that can be removed is dangerous because if you snap it in and hamster is anywhere near it , you can pinch an ear , tail , or leg . I paid a lot more for this at PetSmart and wound up taking it back after 3 months because it was so crappy ( the store let me exchange for a better one ) . Do not buy this cage ! !	-1
Do n't buy this cage . It looks great , but it has one disasterous design flaw , and that is the latch for the `` removable petting zone '' is totally flimsy and often does n't latch , even when you 'd think it did . That 's how Nibbles my friend 's hamster escaped earlier this evening prompting a frantic search of the main floor of my house , only to find it behind the dryer . We tied a large piece of carrot to a string and coaxed the critter out into the open where I nabbed it and put it back in the cage , with the `` petting zone '' securly taped shut . Right now the hamster is running around the family room in her exercise ball getting rid of all that energy from the excitement earlier this evening.The `` petting zone '' is actually the preferred place for this hamster to sleep . It 's actually a loft bedroom and it 's extremely easy to not latch the cover down , and then poof , your hamster is off to explore your house.So , aside from the colorful look and the neat gadgets , one critical design flaw makes this something I would never buy for myself . Four days to go , and this critter cage contraption goes back to it 's owner .	-1
The wheel on this is horrible and shakes and keeps us up at night . I tried putting rubber bands , oil , tape and other things to make it fit better , but eventually it gets really loud again . The inserts for the multiple layers is a bit difficult to put back when you 're cleaning it , but not impossible . It 's mainly lop-sided , but it 's fine .	-1
Impossible to clean , you remove the top , everything comes apart . My hamsters escaped countless times , found myself having to duct tape parts of the cage they were escaping from . Plastic breaks all over the place , more duct tape . This is a poor excuse for a cage .	-1
I bought CritterTrail Three after a wire in the last cage came apart . I specifically wanted a cage with wire sides so as to provide more ventilation for the hamsters . I also wanted a cage that provided lots of room for movement and an easily removable base for cleaning.I did not see a display of the CritterTrail Three in the store , so I was pleasantly surprised by its size and aesthetic appeal . It 's quite attractive and plenty of room for my two Winter White hamsters.Putting it together took a little work . The plastic is very cheap and I was hoping nothing would crack when I was assembling it . Fortunately , nothing broke.Once I got it together , I decided to test how easy to clean it really is . It 's written right on the box that the bottom comes off and it 's kid-friendly , easy to clean . Well , the bottom comes off after some tugging and pulling , and it 's difficult to put back together . Unlike other reviewers , I resolve to clean this cage in a very messy way , like I did my last cage -- take the petting area off and dump it upside down . Then , take a hose and wash it down with soap and water . I did a test drive and was n't careful , so the whole top came off , which is just as much trouble to put back on as the bottom.So now , I have imposed upon myself some rules:1 ) carry it only from the base , not by holding the wire portion or anyplace else.2 ) never take the base off for cleaning.3 ) when cleaning , take all the platforms and accessories out and dump the whole thing upside down into the trash . Be careful to hold the lid so that it does not fall off.My last issue is with the water bottle . I ended up buying a glass water bottle to replace the one included . The water bottle is made of soft plastic . My hamsters being the type to chew everything would surely chew through this quickly . Also , the water does not dispense easily . After the initial spill of a few drops , nothing more comes out . I tap the tip lightly with my finger and still nothing . My hamsters could n't figure it out even as they were sniffing about the spout . The situation was complicated by the fact that the spout faced straight down and forced them to look straight up to drink . I left the bottle in their cage for a few hours while I went to buy a replacement . As soon as I put the replacement bottle in , they drank with a vengeance . Obviously , they were n't getting water.PROS : * lots of room for the hamsters to move about* attractive* expandable* wire sides provide more ventilation than plastic cages.CONS : * brittle plastic* falls apart easily* base does not come off easily and is even more difficult to reassemble* water bottle forces hamsters to bend their necks into an awkward upward position* water bottle does not dispense water easily* water bottle is soft plastic , easy for hamsters to chew through.I do n't think I 'd buy this again . Well , maybe I would . My daughter thinks the cage is beautiful , which it is , and I do have a soft spot for her when she 's just begging for it . I just wo n't take her shopping next time . From what other reviewers say here and the cheap plastic feel and the way it 's falling apart brand spanking new , I 'm pretty sure that will be sooner rather than later.UPDATE : I have found my solution of dumping the whole thing upside down not workable , since it falls apart anyway . Still I managed to keep most of it together.One problem has surfaced after having owned it for less than two weeks , one of the horizontal wires came loose from the vertical wire . I tried to solder it back together and it is holding for now . Hope nothing else falls apart.On a positive note , the deep tray does keep the scatter down to a minimum.ANOTHER UPDATE : It has been about nine months and two of the wires have come loose . It seems they are not joined very well . For the price I would expect more out of this cage . We will have to begin a search for another cage soon .	-1
The other reviewers are correct . This toy does kill cats.A few years ago , my cat was strangled by this toy . We had this toy in a doorway for at least a year & he never tired of playing with it . Then one evening , after a full work day , I walked into my home and found him tangled in the cord & dead.Save yourself the heartache & guilt.I guess it would ok if the cat was supervised 100 % of the time when playing with it . NEVER give your pet access to it when you leave home , go to bed or if doing something that distracts you.Like children , pets get bored with their toys so putting them away after play will keep them interested in it for much longer . If your pet no longer plays with a favorite toy , put it in a closet or drawer for a few months . When you give it to them later , they will act like it is brand new again .	-1
Within three hours my three cats had torn the mouse from the cord so not really happy with this toy	-1
My 12 year old kitty gives it some attention but not a lot . its not her favorite toy but she gives it some attention from time to time . the price was good .	-1
This is junk . The feathers are n't very soft and my cat had the two large feathers pulled off of the toy within five minutes of playing with it . His toys usually last much longer than this , so I am fairly certain it is the quality of the toy and not my cat .	-1
I thought these would be a great toy for my cat , but I guessed wrong . He 's never even given them a second look .	-1
My cat loves to chase and swat toys around the house . Her curiosity with theses shimmer balls is limited to watching me try to entice her to play with them . Durable , pretty , pricey , and not for my cat .	-1
advertised as very quiet , called Penn Plax very difficult to reach , left msg 's , sent e-mail , finally talked to someone did what they said to do about noise , which was to shake it , reached again said I would have to buy a new impeller , even tho it was still under warranty and had only been set up a very short time . Amazon was great and we returned product , would not advise getting this canister filter if u do n't like noise .	-1
This item had mostly good reviews but did not work for me . It started and stopped constantly and did n't keep the water clear at all .	-1
IF I COULD GIVE THIS PIECE OF CHINA JUNK NO STARS I SURELY WOULD ! THIS JUNK RUINED MY LOWER LEVEL . IT STOPPED WORKING AFTER ONLY ABOUT 6 DAYS . MY AQUARIUM WATER WAS AT ABOUT FOURTH FULL AND MY POOR EXPENSIVE ALBINO OSCARS WHO ARE 12 INCHES LONG WERE IN THE TANK THE TWO OF THEM IN A CORNER WONDERING WHAT IS GOING ON . WE HAD A BIG MESS TO CLEAN . FIRST WE TRIED THE FILTER AGAIN AND IT WOULD N'T WORK . HAD TO HIRE PEOPLE TO COME IN AND REMOVE THE WATER , CLEAN & DISENFECT ( EXTRA COST ) THE CARPETED AREAS AND RUN OUT TO THE PET STORE TO PURCHASE ANOTHER FILTER . WHEN I SAW THAT THIS ITEM WAS MADE IN CHINA I SHOULD 'VE IMMEDIATELY SENT THIS JUNK BACK . DO N'T BUY THIS UNLESS YOU WANT WASTE YOUR MONEY AND PAY FOR PEOPLE TO COME IN REMOVE WATER , APPLY DISINFECTANT AND STILL HAVE TO PURCHASE ANOTHER FILTER TO PREVENT YOUR POOR HELPLESS FISH FROM DYING . IT COST ME A TOTAL OF $ 350.00 FOR THE CLEANUP OF MY LOWER LEVEL FAMILY ROOM AND 2ND KITCHEN . SEND THIS PIECE OF JUNK BACK TO CHINA LET THEM HAVE THEIR JUNK BACK . THATS WHY WE NEVER SHOP AT WALMART -- -A BUNCH OF LOUSY CHINESE MADE PRODUCTS . IF THEY 'RE NOT KILLING OUR BABIES & DOGS WITH POISON FORMULA & DOG ; FOOD , THEIR BUIDING THESE SUBPAR USELESS , FAULTY PRODUCTS THEY CAN KEEP THEIR JUNK ! IF IT SAYS MADE IN CHINA SEND IT BACK ! And this piece of junk cost me 95.98 and now I see the seller has raised the price . This piece of junk should cost no more than 20.00 especially with MADE IN CHINA on the box . That 's why its a piece of junk . I even purchased Sunsun 4-Stage which is a bit cheaper and it ran for years kept this 90 gallon tank crystal clear ! This item when it did work for the 6 days the tank was still cloudy ! I should have immediately sent this trash back . Now I 'm out all of this money to clean my lower level areas . This trash is going back as soon as USP come to get it . And I want a full refund . I 'm glad this item show its true colors before the 30 days then I would have been stuck with this malfunctioning item . So take my word and do n't buy this item unless you want to have a great big wet mess to clean or pay someone to clean for you . And why it pulled the water out of the tank and onto the floor is a mystery to me .	-1
I spent several hours pumping , taking the unit apart and putting it back together so many times ... I was just about to throw it out the window . It was n't until I took a 60mm syringe and injected water into the intake that it took off on it 's own and that took 6 shots It does n't say anything about filling it first but I did that and still nothing . I went through the hoses , I did everything imaginable and yet ... .the primer button simply does not work ! If I have to go through this every time it gets unplugged , I will send it back . It had better produce some pretty darned good water for all I had to go through tonight . I 've never been more frustrated with a product in my life , and to think the main reason I bought it was because of the wonderful priming feature ! At this point I 'm giving it one star ... If it continues to work well and I do n't have to go scuba diving in my tank to get it started again , I may change my mind but for now I would n't buy another or recommend it to anyone else to either . **************************************UPDATE************************************After hours of trying to get someone to help me with this problem , I was told I would receive a new motor in 7-9 business days ! I was all ready to change my review and forgive the problem as things sometimes `` just happen '' but after 11 day of hearing nothing I emailed them back . I was told ; `` oop 's we thought we had them in stock but wo n't have them in until the second week of November '' it is now the second week of September ! I spend a lot of money with Amazon and I know it 's not their fault but I think I 'm just going to send this back and find a better filter company to deal with . ****************************************Update*************************************I sent this back and bought a Fluval , it was more expensive but it 's worth not having the headaches . I 'm happy for all those that have had no problems but not only did the unit not prime , it was n't doing a very good job on the water either . I bought extra premium filter media to add to this unit , still my water was cloudy . I did n't know how bad the water was until I bought the Fluval ! My tank water quality is now immaculate ! I 'm learning that when it comes to filtration , cheaper usually means frustration and more work down the road ! I had to spend an extra $ 75.00 for the Fluval but the peace of mind is well worth it.Service is extremely important ! I could forgive them for not having the part and even the defective unit but I waited for two weeks only to be told you 'll have to wait a couple more months ... this is no way to do business and they wo n't be getting any more of mine !	-1
I miss my jbj filter . This filter doesnot keep the tank clean . Once I get more money coming in im replacing thisfilter	-1
I purchased these balls for a hunting platform of my newly purchased Cat Power Tower . Although my kittens loved pushing them out of the openings and then chasing them around the bedroom , the balls lasted only a few days before they warped and needed to be thrown out . There is a piece of round plastic that is inside to make a noise but it did not hold the attention of the cats for long . More importantly , it could pose a choking hazard to your felines or to other pets or young children that may be present .	-1
I just got these and the ingredients are : wheat germ ( one of my dogs is allergic to wheat and corn ) , Kaolin ( which is used to coat magazine pages among other uses ) CORN SYRUP , Pork Liver , Meat ( does n't say what kind ) Dicalcium Phosphate , SUGAR ... ... .. and Corn Starch ... ..I 'd be hard pressed to find another `` vitamin '' that has more dog allergic ingredients and has so much sugar in it ... ..The full panel of ingredients should have been mentioned in the product description since these contain the most likely ingredients for a dog to be allergic to : corn & wheat ! These are going back . In addition , strangely enough , my dogs ( all 8 rescues of various ages and breeds ) actually walked away from these ! Thankfully they have a money back guarantee : `` If your dog does n't love Pet-Tabs , return to place of purchase for a full refund . `` ... I will take them up on their offer and get a better grade of vitamins ... ... and much less to NO SUGAR ! Sugar is NOT a vitamin !	-1
First off , this bottle was basically the same as the item described , but it did look different . I suppose it was a `` new look '' and the photo did n't get updated . Just an FYI.Moving on to the important stuff ... This bottle developed a leak within the first month of use . It now only takes a few minutes for all the water to drip out . I 'm going to have to buy a different one .	-1
This bottle drips / leaks . It is poorly made . It is low quality . I do n't like the attachment design . Do n't waste your money . There are many better options on Amazon .	-1
Worked great , love the clip , like the design . But here we are 8 weeks out and it leaks . It has a spring in the metal drip tub holding the ball in place and thats were it is leaking from . So there is no way to fix it .	-1
I bought this water bottle from a well-known online pet store right before my short `` weekend '' vacation out of town for my Syrian hamster . I was first attracted to the fact that it would be firmly attached OUTSIDE of her cage . When I first put if in ( prior to me leaving for two days ) I tested it with my finger MULTIPLE times just to make sure water was indeed coming out ( I 've had previous bottles that this was a problem , ) and it seemed to be in working condition . HOWEVER , when I returned home from my trip I noticed that the water bottle was still full ; this was odd despite the fact that my hamster does not drink that much to begin with . I took her out of her cage to find a VERY lethargic , `` sickly , '' and sad hamster . I tried treats and various other methods in order to try to improve her happiness , and finally decided to offer her a bowl of water . She drank constanly for almost twenty minutes straight , until the water was completely gone ! She drank like she had never seen water before in her life ! That was such a scary situation , and although I stand by the `` Super Pet '' product line 95 % I just do not recommend this product in particular . Try spending the extra couple of dollars to buy their chew-proof glass bottle instead ; you will not regret it ! !	-1
Mine came with a wooden ball inside , not an almond , a perfectly round and smooth wooden ball ! I smeared peanut butter on it and the rats still have n't showed much interest in it . Maybe tonight when they are most active , but it seems a waste of money , especially since it did n't come as advertised .	-1
My rabbit does n't care at all for this thing . She frankly could care less it is there maybe it is good for hamsters or something else , or maybe it is just my rabbit , but for me and my pet this did nothing but take up space .	-1
We purchased this for our gerbil to have . A MONTH after the order ( And it was prime eligible , we are prime members ) , it came . We had an order form saying it was the nut knot , but it was actually a bag of rabbit food ! ! So annoying ! We contacted the `` Best '' Service Stores company and they said they 'd ship it out immediately . Two weeks later , it still did n't come . We contacted them again , A month later , it FINALLY came . We were so disappointed . There was no nut , just a small wooden ball , just like the mini nut knot we purchased as well for our dwarf hamster . Well , they were definitely Worst Service Stores , and we are never ordering anything from them again .	-1
My two rats have never paid any attention to this thing . It looks good and fun , I would play with it , but the rats not so much .	-1
My bunny does n't love it . She chews on it here and there . It is mostly still intact after months of & # 34 ; use & # 34 ; . I would n't buy this again .	-1
My bunny is still on the younger side ( one year ) and this did n't work well for her . She kicked the pebbles around and it did n't do the best job absorbing anything , including the smell . It may work better for a ferret but I would n't recommend this for an active bunny .	-1
My bunny loves this litter . However , every time she pees it turns to clay making a very hard mess to clean out .	-1
This litter is disgusting . When it gets wet , it smells terrible and it is like glue . You have to scrape it off of everything . It is expensive , and not worth the time . I now get pellet beddig . It has a nice wood smell , is super absorbent , and is easy to clean up . Not to mention it is $ 5 for 40lbs at tractor supply company ,	-1
My rats kept getting the litter stuck in their & # 34 ; boy- parts & # 34 ; and it took an entire box to fill the litter box once and the smell was ungodly..	-1
Does n't clump , just makes a big mess in the litter box . Much easier ( and WAY cheaper ) to just fill their litter boxes with cage bedding .	-1
When using this item it was harder to actually clean my rabbits litter box.It stuck to the bottom of his litter box like plaster & I had to empty out the whole litter box in one day & did n't work for odors.I went back to my previous litter for my rabbit .	-1
When I bought this litter I was looking for something specifically for ferrets and other small animals because I wanted a dust free and easy to clean litter . This stuff says on it that it is dust free ... wrong . It is very dusty . As soon as I poured it into the litter pan a cloud of dust puffed out in my face . I clean my ferrets litter pan every day . At the end of the day that first day , when I went to clean the pan it was an absolute mess in there . The little pellets turned to mush . They definitely soaked up the urine , but when they did the pellets turned into a big mucky pile of excrement . It was a pain in the butt to clean up and the mush of a mess was ll over the whole cage . And my poor little Bandit had the mush all over her back paws and legs . I will never use this stuff again and would n't recommend it to anybody .	-1
My ferret loves this but for the wrong reason -- he thinks its a toy ! he plays in it , scattering it everywhere . He now poops `` next '' to the litter pan so he doesnt get his `` play area '' dirty LOL not happy !	-1
We wanted to litter train our guinea pigs and thought this would be a good way for them to recognize the difference between their box and the rest of the bedding in the cage . Nope ! It was not only pointless and really dusty , but has its own weird smell . Claims to absorb oder but could n't contain the smell from the small amount of wet bedding mixed in there to try and attract the G.P to their box . Glorified cat litter , that 's really what this is . Though it may be helpful for a smaller animal . We were able to potty train them with wood shavings in there instead . We started them off by adding just a little hay on top of the wood shavings and putting their droppings ( yuck , lol ) in.They quickly got the hang of it . We tried this same method first with the litter but they wanted nothing to do with it . Not one of them ( 3 total , 2 together , one in her own house ) would stay in it after their first couple of inspections except to run through it as part of their race track . I think they did n't like the feel of the litter or maybe the smell . Not sure , just thankful they use the potty box now . Makes cleaning the cages a lot easier . Good luck to everyone and potty training !	-1
I had bought this for my ferrets when I first adopted them . The one advantage of this is how large and flexible it is . However , it is basically just soft clear plastic draped over wire . I could easily see a ferret chewing on and eating that soft plastic , which is very bad . One of my ferrets chewed a hole on one of the ends within 5 minutes ... My ferrets do not like tunnels , so they did not like it . I suspect many ferrets would enjoy this though , but I cant really give it more than 2 stars with the safety concerns .	-1
One of my ferrets quit using his litter box and started using a corner on a shelf of his cage instead so I bought these . I tried to use just one these springs in the corner at first and it did n't work . My ferret just backed up to it and poo 'd on it . I then tried using all four in the same corner and all that made him do was poo in front of the springs . My ferret would also try pulling and chewing on the springs so I gave up and removed them . I bought a toy that fastens to the cage and put it in that corner and finally my ferret quit going there and started using his litter box .	-1
Did n't really work . They used their butt to push it up or down and go under it or on it .	-1
They have n't worked for me.But I think they might work to fasten the water bottle to the cage.They are sturdy and stretchy and they wo n't hurt the ferrets , but now I get to clean poop off of springs too !	-1
I hope other fuzzies are interested in this item because my girls could really care less . They have n't given it a second glance since I put it in their cage .	-1
This thing was just a dumb dangling thing , the elastic is too strong for the pets to play with it , and its just ... . ugly lol . Get something cuter and stretchier .	-1
This item never made it to my parakeet . The item arrived with just a bunch of loose seeds . The seeds are `` glued '' to sticks , and during shipping the seeds come unglued . One of the sticks had completely disintegrated . If you see this item at a pet shop you might want to try it , but I do not recommend buying it online.It 's also an expensive item for so little . At more than two dollars a stick it is not a good value . There are other ways to give a treat to your parakeets.I gave it two stars instead of one simply for the benefit of a doubt that my parakeet might actually have liked it .	-1
We tried a million different treats for our rabbit ! This was one of the unfortunate ones that did n't make the cut . Of course , we may just have a picky rabbit because there was n't much she did like ! Tried with our guinea pig too & he never paid them any attention .	-1
I loved this container while I had it in the closet . The first day I left it available to my dogs , it was destroyed . They could not get in the top , but half of one side was chewed open . Too bad . I need a stainless or bear proof container for my beasts ( lab/husky mixes - @ 50 lbs each ) .	-1
Every time I use this container I end up struggling to align it properly so I can close it correctly .	-1
I just received my 'package ' of these pads . It did not have any packaging other than the box the pads are held in , and the box is all crushed and torn . The pads had obviously been taken from someplace else and jammed into the box - they were not even lined up ! Some were placed in sideways , other flat on the bottom and stacked like pancakes ! They all looked as if they had been opened up and re-folded . They do not feel as thick as the last ones I ordered - the backing is a different color so they may not even be Wee Wee pads ! I am not even going to use them - I am going to return them . I am furious ! I had ordered them last March and they were wonderful . I use them for a very old cat who occasionally can not make it to his litter box . I am SO disappointed !	-1
I have been using these pads for several years with great success until recently . My last box was packed differently and the pads are awful ! ! ! My elderly dog has never `` missed '' a pad until this new box . Now the urine pools on top of the pad so she is wetting on the floor near the edge to avoid walking on the wet spots . These pads also leak ! ! ! Never a problem for me in the past . The old pads would wick the urine away and leave the top dry for several days . These wo n't even hold one one incontinent episode . I am trying a new brand now , but trust me ... these are no better than the blue pads you can buy at Dollar General for 1/4 the price .	-1
I just opened the box that I got the other day and was very surprised that these are not like it says they are . They are NOT 28 x 35.5 and the quilting does not even got to the sides on the large piddle pad tray . Totally unusable for us since my little male dog likes to give the edges a run for their money . These are going back .	-1
I do n't know what the deal was with this toy . I did not purchase through Amazon . I found it at a major pet store in a nearby town . It looked PERFECT for my African Grey Congo . I figured it would be safe enough she could n't harm herself . As soon as I took it out of the package , it REEKED like some kind of rotten rubber . I washed it and let it air dry . I could not get the over powering stench out of it . I was afraid to give it to my parrot . I just threw it away . I do n't know if that was unusual or what was going on . It was n't worth my time or gas money to even bother taking it back . I now stay away from that brand . Has anyone else had any kind of experience ? ? Were you able to get rid of the odor ? ? Thanks .	-1
My parrotlets do n't really care for this toy . They pay no attention to the mirrors on the toy and the biggest attraction is the beads in the bell.It is by no means a favorite..	-1
I discovered these sand perches are just plastic with some kind of grit stuck on . I had to buff down because grit was to sharp for my birds feet - in doing so that is how I made this discovery . Unfortunately I bought a number of these thinking that they were in fact sand perches .	-1
Again , these products are not real sand perches - just plastic covered with grit . Not at all good for birds . But then it is profit over/before pets .	-1
What is this chirp thing ? Prefer my regular water dish and you can just take this chirp plastic thing outta my house .	-1
I bought two of these when I set up the new finch cage . I liked the idea of being able to add drinking water without having to open a cage door . However , the drinking trough , which is the part that is inside the cage , and the part they drink from , seems to be too narrow for the finches beaks , and they do n't drink from them at all . The ends of the troughs should be made a little larger - looking somewhat like a keyhole or cul-de-sac . The troughs would stlll fit through the bars on the cage when installing them , and the finches would drink from them .	-1
This is a very cheaply made item . My bird wont even use it , its too small of an area where the water comes out . Do n't waste your money . Get a larger glass bottle waterer .	-1
This feeder is a great idea with a poor design . Firstly , it does not fit either of my parakeet cages . Secondly , it leaks seeds due to poor design . And thirdly , it fills with husks just as any other feeder with a tray does . So the advertising is false . I had to do several modifications for it to fit and then fill the gap where seeds fall through . It can not be turned open fully as directed , since seeds spill out without restraint . But turning it mostly closed does work ... with the gap filled in . It could be great but for people who are not handy with tools and do not have materials lying around to modify , it is a disaster .	-1
The tube is on the outside of the cage and the tray for the birds to eat out of is on the inside so the cage bars are between the two . On my cages this means that when the seed starts moving most of it flows though the gap that the bars create between the tube and the tray and the whole tube ends up being emptied very quickly . I 'm happy to see evidence of the birds eating well , but there is no way they were eating THAT much THAT fast . I do n't know how some people are getting it to work without modification .	-1
These dishes stick way out in the cage and both of the ones I received had mal-formed threads on the stem for attachment to the cage , so a wrench had to be used to get them off , once I got them on and they did not fit tightly against the cage , but wobbled . Making them any tighter would have broken the plastic connector . They are too big even for a large parakeet cage and my birds avoided them completely . I removed them and put in pinch type tubes which they went to immediately .	-1
Left in cage for days and my parakeets would not or could not use it . Also would not stay tight on cage so instead of sending it back will place it outside for the birds who will eat out of anything .	-1
The Tanzanian Mountain Ball Large Dog Toy I received as others have commented is not that Large . It was also black . I am very disappointed in the color and I 'm sure it will be lost in the shadows very quickly . I think I would have liked this item had it been a different color than the one I received .	-1
It is a bit too heavy for my dogs and I had trouble getting it to hold food and treats .	-1
Get the kong brand toy that looks similar to this one . It will hold up against aggressive chewers , this one wo n't . Our puppy ripped it apart in minutes .	-1
I think this ball is invisible to the canine eye ... .none of my dogs even look at it and they are curious about everything ! Collie , sheltie , and dachshunds ... .nothing . Also has a vent hole through the center of the ball which would be dangerous for a dog 's tongue getting stuck - that is , if my dogs acknowledged it 's existence ! Should have saved my money on all the rubber toys and stuck with empty drinking water bottles .	-1
This lasted 10 minutes.Now , to be fair , I have an 8mo old male rottweiler and he 's big on chewing . I decided to give this toy a go because JW Pet makes another toy he loves ( the thing that looks like a springy DNA strand ) that has lasted MONTHS . I thought another toy by the same brand would hold up just as well.I was wrong.Because this barbell-looking toy is hollow , it makes it very easy for extreme chewer dogs like mine to chew off bits and pieces . Thankfully he does n't try to eat them but other dogs might . If you have a dog with strong jaws , I 'd recommend you forgo this toy and get the boing-y DNA toy instead .	-1
My Lab easily chewed the little nubs off of this toy . He loves it , but he can not play with it anymore . The description says it can withstand lots of chewing without discoloring or losing the flavor , but that does n't really matter if the toy can be chewed apart !	-1
Something about the Chompion they just do n't like ... they refuse to play with it . And they LOVE to chew toys , so I 'm a bit puzzled . Oh , well .	-1
Much smaller than anticipated .	-1
My dog had this toy less than 5 minutes before it was trash . Unless you have a dainty dog , I would n't buy this .	-1
Picture and description make it seem a lot bigger for medium dogs but this is better for small dogs . Bought as stocking stuffers and had plenty of room left . Not worth the money	-1
For some reason this was not working right from the packaging . Whatever is inside the ball seemed messed up and the ball does n't do what it is advertized to do . Despite that though my dog LOVES to chew the thing so not a complete bust but for the money I was expecting something different and it was n't what I wanted .	-1
The only time it 'giggles ' is when it bounces and hits the floor in a particular position or you manually shake it . You have to hold the ball in a particular position when u shake or it wo n't giggle . Also , in my opinion , this is not a giggle . It 's a weird annoying noise .	-1
First time we 've ever been disappointed in an Amazon-offered dog toy . ( And believe me ... . our house is FULL of them ... ! ) The ball merely made the noise of & # 34 ; spare & # 34 ; or & # 34 ; loose & # 34 ; parts knocking around ... not the fun , giggling sound we were anticipating . We bought the & # 34 ; talking ball & # 34 ; some time ago , and we ( AND our dog ! ) just loved it . It was a lot of fun watching her chase it around while it & # 34 ; taunted & # 34 ; her ... . ! But this one was apparently only defective in its production . I returned it per the return instructions , and had requested a & # 34 ; replacement & # 34 ; -- but found I had received a & # 34 ; credit & # 34 ; on my account instead . That was a bit disappointing , too ... . Maybe there was just an overall problem with the production of this particular toy ... . ?	-1
I always buy regular sized toys for my dogs . I have 2 cocker spaniels and a jack russell terrier and none of them like to play with this . It just seems too heavy and they can not can not get it to make any noises by themselves . They are not weak or gentle with their toys . The jack russell terrier actually likes to shake his head and throw his own toys , but this one is not even worth it to him . Despite the size , I would only recommend this to someone with a large or very strong dog . I also would say that the noise that this toy makes is not anywhere near a giggling sound .	-1
Lasted about 5 mins and our boxer cracked the plastic inside destroying the sound giggler . The Fantastic Foam Ball Medium ball is oddly more durable	-1
This would have been a perfect product if they fix/improve the following : * The size should be smaller or they should at least offer a small size* The sound mechanism should be replaced by something electronic that DOES sound like giggles ( or change the product name ! )	-1
Just okay , does n't do much , my dog ca n't grasp it.Actually quite boring toy for a pet , unless your dogis a large retriever .	-1
my dog loved the babble ball so I decided to try this because it is rubber as opposed to hard plastic . well he chewed it so hard the first day , now he has a ball that sounds like it has broken glass inside . Might be wonderful for smaller dogs . Mine is a large Labrador retriever .	-1
I received the ball in a timely manner . It is a heavy duty rubber ball . My problem is that the sound did not work after my dog had it the first day . In reality after 2 hours it was not making any noise at all . Do n't waste your money .	-1
My Dog had no interest in playing with it . The dog REALLY has to shake their head to get it to make the slightest amount of noise , not what I was expecting .	-1
i bought this for my blind gsd puppy . it makes no noise , no & # 34 ; giggle & # 34 ; no nothing . what a waste of money for us	-1
My puppy went through 2 of these ( one blue , one lime green ) . He really did n't play with either of them very much . The first one was gone within 3 months , with mild chewing ( more like mouthing on it , because the whole ball would squish in his mouth , like he was trying to find a squeaker in it ) ... and the other was fatally wounded after about a week . Both had signs of tears at all joints , so it was n't going to take much to really tear it apart into multiple , hazardous pieces.Once the rubber is torn the toy has to be discarded . This happens with the lightest of pulls and chews . If we were n't watching him , swallowing a piece would be very dangerous . I do n't recommend these products at all . The type of rubber used and construction is very cheap and fragile . If your dog enjoys rubber , for a similar price you can get a number of different ( and more durable ) Kong toys .	-1
This ball turned weird and cakey texture . It left pink rubber all over the place , and then after I washed it , it was chalky and discolored . The smell is weird too . My dogs never played with it .	-1
Received the 5 '' Hol-ee Roller . My 10 month old Australian Cattle Dog pup destroyed it within 15 minutes . I did NOT let her sit & chew on it . All the damage was done while she was catching it & carrying it back to me . Each time she was catching it , she must have bitten right through a section . Thank goodness I did not let her just sit & chew on this toy.I contacted the manufacture online & emailed pics of the ruined product . They very politely & very promptly sent out a replacement of something they felt would be more durable.The Hol-ee Roller X arrived yesterday ! It appears much heavier & thicker then the Hol-ee Roller . It is about the same size @ 5 '' diameter . So far the X ball is working out great ! I still will not trust letting my pup play unsupervised with this toy . We will just use it for fetching & for our `` puppy soccer '' games . It has become my pup 's new favorite toy though so I will buy a few more of these for her ! Conclusion : If you think your pup or dog has a hard bite , get the Hol-ee Roller X instead of the Hol-ee Roller ! BUT , do n't ever 100 % trust any of these toys not come apart . I 've read other reviews of both the Hol-ee Roller & the Hol-ee Roller X , ( which I think used to be called the Hol-ee Mol-ee ? ) . ALWAYS monitor & inspect all your dogs toys ! Even a small piece bitten off could cause an expensive vet visit , or even worse , death !	-1
My dog ate it . I do n't just mean he chewed it . . . he ATE it ! Then again I bought this before he was diagnosed with Pica . This is not a good toy to leave laying around the house if your pup is a chewer !	-1
I bought this for my 16 month old , 47lbs . Aussie Sheppard mix . She loved it . And she tore a piece off within 5 minutes . I took it away . I played with her briefly again with it , then she was chewing while we talked . It was 1/3 destroyed in about half an hour . She did like it . She took one angled 1 inch piece and wanted me to play tug-of-war with it with her ! I only wished it held up a reasonable amount of time , as I was led to believe by other reviews .	-1
It is bigger than I thought it would be and the Milkbones that I was hoping to place inside of the ball always fall out . Not very fun	-1
Larger holes than appearance here . It 's for a small dog and I would say I received the wrong side . And oh my Maltese love them ! To pieces . 1 day . One even tried to eat a chewed off piece . Really do n't get the hype and do n't get these balls if you do n't know for sure how they look and what your dog will do with them .	-1
Didnt last long puppy tore it apart in ten minutes ! My previous dog loved this and did n't destroy his toys ... ..not much lasts with this dog so it may be fun for your dog	-1
Durable , but my dog ( lab ) is not interested in it . My 8 year old son is more interested in it . I was n't sure where to rate this .	-1
I orginally got a Hol-ee Roller Dog Toy at Petsmart and it lasted for a while ( like a few months ) before my Corgi really tore it apart . Since my dog loved this ball , I picked up another on Amazon . Within maybe 20 minutes , probably less , she started chewing on it and it was done . Had to take it away because she was tearing off small pieces . Not very strong material . Would not buy again and ca n't recommend until they change their rubber to a sturdier material .	-1
If your best friend is a power chewer like mine , save your money ! Within 10 minutes , my Goldendoodle tore a piece of this ball off and was chewing it like bubble gum . Previously , we had the 3 inch ball . That one lasted for nearly two years . I 'm guessing that the longer the connecting web pieces are , the less strength they have . I will order the 3 inch ball again to see if we can get another two years out of it , but I can not recommend the 5 inch ball to anyone .	-1
We just got our 10.5 month old Black Lab mix last weekend ( he 's about 50lbs and real strong ) , and this was one of the toys that we were given with him when we picked him up . He mostly ignored it for the first couple of days , until he destroyed every other toy that he 'd had and suddenly it started looking good . I 'd spent a good amount of time researching toys that seemed like they would withstand his jaws , as we discovered quickly he 's a chewer , and a mighty good one at that . I came across various reviews about this toy that seemed like it would be good for him , I verified when I got home that this in fact was a toy I already had , which gave me hope that maybe he 'd have a toy that would last long enough until I could get him some Kong and Nylabone toys . I was wrong . He got interested in this last night and about 3 minutes after he got hold of it , he had it between his paws breaking and ripping the little connections out of it . I had to take it away and throw it out because , he 's also got a habit of eating things as he 's ripping them apart . I just hope the toy I ordered yesterday afternoon made by JW does n't end up the same way ...	-1
my dog had this toy for five minutes before she destroyed it ! If you have a strong chewer , I would not recommend this product .	-1
My 6 month old , 31 lb , Lab mix puppy destroyed this toy in less than 10 minutes . She chewed right through one of the `` arms '' and pulled so hard the others started to break apart . If you have a dog with very sharp teeth and strong jaws , who is a power chewer , do n't get this product . It is not nearly indestructible , as advertised . It 's a shame because she really loves it . If the company can make one that is really tough , I 'd buy it .	-1
I purchased this for my ( at that time ) ten month old Airedale puppy . Withing a half hour or so , she had a chunk out of one of the rings . I took it away and she proceeded to chew a chunk out of the second ring . I learned my lesson ( I had thought that the black ring might be tougher , but it was n't ) and threw the pieces and the remaining intact ring away .	-1
This toy gets a no from the dogs . No matter how I try they just wo n't play with it . I 've told them how there are poor dogs that would love a toy like this but they just stare at me .	-1
None of my dogs like this thing . They range from a small terrier to a large black lab and they all find it equally boring .	-1
1. dogs did n't like it [ very unusual for them . ] 2. rubber softer than description seems . 3. their teeth can get kind of hooked in the holes although since its soft that 's not a huge deal .	-1
Never got a chance to stuff with treats because the ~80lb Cur had it distroyed in moments . It is not durable for a strong chewer .	-1
I bought this for my 65-pound mutt to manipulate ( throw , carry , paw , roll , etc . ) , but needed food inside to keep her attention . I was n't expecting it to be indestructable , but I expected it to last longer than 8 minutes . I watched her the entire time . She nibbled on the dehydrated yam slice through the holes of the toy and inadvertently tore off a small ( ~ 1/4-inch ) piece of the rubber . She grabbed a hold of the weakened area and pulled ( not exceptionally forceful ) at the section for about a minute before the small tear ripped completely through the section . She 's not interested in playing with it unless there 's food inside and if there is food inside she will find the ripped area and stick her nose in there to pull the food through . I am most disappointed that the rubber material was so easy to rip through once that small compromised area was exposed .	-1
I did n't even leave my dog alone with this , I was sitting right there with him , tossing the ball down the hallway and he brought it back to me broken . I just let him destroy it , took about 3 minutes . I like JW Pet products usually but not this one . Also it 's pretty big if I remember right , larger than a softball .	-1
We typically use stuff like this for fetch and not chewing . My 75lb dog does n't get toys like this with out me supervisoring her and actively playing by her side . We just got this and I turned my head for less than a minute and she had a chunk chewed off . UGHHHH !	-1
The ends/bends have weak points , therefore leading to colorful poop . Did n't take long for my dog to chew through it .	-1
My 67 pound mixed breed dog ripped this thing to pieces 3 days after I received this . BE VERY CAREFUL because it breaks down in little chunks and your dog can choke on them ! ! !	-1
This is a soft rubber and it is easily swallowed if you have a heavy chewer like mine . Supervise carefully .	-1
i really liked playing tug and throwing it for my little terrier . Unfortunately , we only got to enjoy it for a couple of days . My boy is a chewer and mauler and he started tearing this toy apart in no time . I had to remove it from him before he started eating the pieces .	-1
My 8 month old lab pup destroyed thisChristmas morning . It tore after a few pulls ! A waste of money	-1
This is NOT a 'Large Dog ' toy . I have owned this toy before and this is a small for a small or medium sized dog . A choking hazard for a large dog . Charged a 'large dog ' price for this item . Need to relabel toy as small/medium . This item comes up when you search for 'Large dog toy ' . If you have a small or medium sized dog it is rugged and will last a long time . Disappointed in the labeling of this item - especially since I have purchased it before . Sadly had to return .	-1
I thought this was the cutest of the 5 dog toys I ordered ! It is cute ! Apparently though , not to the dogs . They simply do not touch this toy . Even when I try to give it to them ! I might take it to my moms dog who is smaller and might enjoy it more .	-1
Neither of my dogs was remotely interested in this toy after the initial courtesy sniff . I 'm not sure if it 's the rubber smell or if they just do n't find it appealing .	-1
There were several negative reviews for this and I have to add mine . Its much softer and more stretchy than I expected it to be . Our dogs who are voracious chewers just would n't have anything to do with it -- and that 's about the only rubber toy I can say that about .	-1
and what dog does n't ? This thing came apart in seconds . It did n't take much to toss this in the trash . Big disappointment .	-1
The material with which this toy is made is not durable . Our dog enjoyed playing with the toy but it was completely destroyed in 20 minutes .	-1
I bought this for my dogs . They are very heavy chewers and nothing lasts very long . This toy lasted about a week and then they started to get it apart .	-1
our small dog chews on her toys a lot . this thing did n't last a day with her . broke quite easily and i do n't recommend this product	-1
When I read the description of this product , I assumed it was 7 '' as pictured . It 's 7 '' stretched ! It 's 1/2 that size as pictured . I 'd never give this tiny thing to my 15 pound Min Pin mix puppy . He 'd rip it apart in seconds . I returned it to Amazon.com .	-1
This was a little frustrating because I was really excited about the low price . I ordered the correct size ( L ) for my dog based on the measurements given and it fits her neck , chest and back , but was super tight around her front legs . I find this bizarre too because her legs are very thin - she is a 35lb mix and her body-type is a lot like the grey scruffy dog in the photo . She ca n't really wear it as it is , but I ca n't size up because that would be way too big . The sweater itself is really cute and seems decently made , so I 'm pretty disappointed about it .	-1
Within 15 minutes my Boston terrier had removed the squeaker and basically destroyed the whole thing . I would n't recommend get a kong toy instead .	-1
I got this toy because I thought my dog would like it and it would be durable . The there does n't seem to be a good size for my dog- it is either so small that I worry about her swallowing it , or pulling out the squeaker . The toy seems too heavy for her , and she is generally disinterested . I was surprised because my dog loves squeaky toys and balls . I would expect that there are plenty of dogs that would love to have this toy , but it 's just not for my boston terrier.One thing I should warn about is the squeaker . It seems like it may brake easily with moderate chewing , so you need to be aware of it and make sure your dog does n't eat it .	-1
My dog ( a German shepherd ) loves it , but he is able to destroy it in 10 -15 minutes . Given the price , that 's an expensive 10-15 minutes . I would have expected better from & # 34 ; Tough by nature & # 34 ; . Has anyone else found a squeaky toy that really lasts with an aggressive chewer ?	-1
I like the sweater- but I am not impressed . I have a 39pd female boxer ( puppy ) and this just about fits her . I knew she would out grow it but I did n't expect it to be too small ( now ) plus she has only worn it once and the sweater all ready has a pull in it . I also purchased a fleece jacket elsewhere & that was a better buy- it fits big as it should for this size and NO pulls plus its water proof . As I said the sweater is nice but not really for doggy daily use . go with a water proof fleece jacket I do n't think this was worth my money	-1
Cheap and mis sized I feel like this was a total rip off.Do not buy this unless you have a long very skinny dog .	-1
We bought this for our 15 pound border terrier . Rubber balls tend to last a lot longer for her , so we had high hopes for this one . Unfortunately , the rubber is n't very thick , so this toy did n't last very long .	-1
This toy is hardly larger than a golf ball , if that . I would not recommend it for anything but a very small dog . I ordered one for my Scottie , but I am returning it to get a larger one . I also ordered a medium Bad Other Cuz which is a perfect size for him and he loves it .	-1
My dogs made quick work of the feet and horns , then they left the ball alone . The ball itself seems durable but the appendages pose a choking hazard when they inevitably are chewed off .	-1
Our yorkie is by no means a tough chewer yet he managed to chew one of the legs off this toy in the first five minutes of play . Luckily we caught it while the second leg was still attached and we were able to take it away before he gnawed off the second leg and swallowed the feet ! We contacted JW Pet Company directly to warn them of the potential choking hazard and the customer service rep actually admitted to me over the phone that they & # 34 ; had been experiencing some quality control issues & # 34 ; and were & # 34 ; working with the manufacturer & # 34 ; to fix the problem . SERIOUSLY ! ! Then she actually had the nerve to refer me to the instructions stating that your pet should be supervised during play.I am very disappointed because we LOVE the JW Pet Company iSqueak ball and our yorkie has enjoyed it for nearly two years with no issues.So unless you want to risk having your pet choke I suggest buying another toy .	-1
My pup got the feet off this toy in 2 minutes ( he destroyed 3 JW Pet & # 34 ; mega last & # 34 ; toys in the following 25 minutes ) . He proceeded to chew off the ears and has made a puncture in the ball too . Waste of money . Just spent $ 60 on JW pet stuff hoping to buy him some adult strength toys , but alas he blew through 3 of he the toys in 30 minutes and does n't seem interested in the other two . Pass .	-1
These toys are super cute and they squeak for awhile BUT the feet fall off and are VERY DANGEROUS ! ! ! ! ! I worried my dog would swallow them but luckily he did n't . Please keep in mind that the squeaker will break , little pieces will come off and the feet will come off . Total CHOKING HAZARD ! ! ! ! Buyer beware ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! I only wish I could give this 0 stars . My dog , a 3 year old Pembroke Welsh Corgi , loves this little ball with the horns but it is very dangerous because of the choking hazards ( the feet and the broken squeaker ) ! ! ! !	-1
I have three puppy mill rescued Pekingese dogs that are all around 2 or 3 years old . They each got one of these from a dog friend of theirs who has them and loves them . My dogs , who are squeak toy experts , killed these things in about 6 minutes after getting them . They snapped the little plastic squeak tube inside of them , then tried to eat the shards of plastic inside of the toy afterward : ( Needless to say , all three of the toys had to be taken away as the little plastic squeak piece inside is a choking hazard for my boys . My boys are n't even especially hard chewers , so I was very surprised when these toys could n't hold up against them . Unfortunately , I would NOT recommend this for anyone who has dogs that love to chew squeak toys.I rated this a 2 and not a 1 because when it was intact and until I took it away , my boys were obsessed with these toys . At first with squeaking them , then with trying to eat the little pieces of plastic that came out of them , so I guess that they have appeal . Just a poor design : (	-1
dont waste your money . I bought two - one for each of my Chihuahuas and they didnt last a day . One toy arrived and it didint squeek . Big waist of money	-1
My dachshund had the feet off in less then 15 min . She also tore out the squeaker . Not a good toy if your dog is a chewer .	-1
My power chewer had a hole in this in less than 2 hrs . Someone recommended this , but it turns out she meant the large one as it is a thicker ball and much stronger . I got the medium.Not sure if I 'll try the large or not.I recommend the Kong ball for a strong chewer .	-1
I measured my dog and went by the description and ordered the small . This sweater was too tight and long for my 4lb pup . Amazon wants $ 5+ to return this item . Very , very unhappy !	-1
I bought four of these sweaters for my dogs ; two red and two blue . They are dachshunds one is 8lbs ( size small ) and one is 14lbs ( size medium . ) The sizing is more for the length of the sweater than the circumference of their chest/belly.Pros+cute+rich color with contrasting arms and neck edge+has an opening on the back for a harnessCons-Poorly constructed ( my medium sized dog 's sweater ripped in the arm after the first use and no activity - she has a heart condition , physical activity is not even possible ) -back leg straps - this may be a positive for some , but I prefer not to have the back straps , they always seem to get tangled in them-does not wash up nicely - material pilled even after being washed gently with WooliteI had two other of these sweaters on back-order , but I immediatly cancelled them as it was a waste of money . I would not recommend these sweaters .	-1
Not only is this sweater too thin to keep my dog warm but the straps that wrap under her hind legs to keep the sweater on never stay on .	-1
This looks like it is a cable knit . It 's not . It is very thin and does n't keep my doggie warm . It does look cute on her though .	-1
My cat does n't love brushes in general , so finding one he 'll tolerate that actually removes hair is a big deal . When he let 's me brush him , it does seem to remove some of excess undercoat hair and it seems gentle , but it does not remove nearly as much hair as the FurminatorFURminator Short Hair deShedding Tool for Large Cats . He really does n't like this brush on his sides or back ( he 's more tolerant of the Furminator ) , even when when I 'm very gentle , but he seems to like it only his face and neck and head , so it 's use is sort of limited for me ( no fault of the brush ) .The problem I do have with this brush is that it 's really difficult to remove all the hair ... it gets stuck in the brush and there is no easy way to clean it ( the Furminator has a button that ejects the hair ) . Additionally , since it has little metal needles , it could irritate sensitive skin ( case in point , as he was brushing up against the brush with his head , he was pressing against it sort of hard and it seems to have reddened the skin right between his eye and ear , where there is n't much hair ) . I will not be using this brush again	-1
cat hates it	-1
My cat doesnt like the bristles this brush has so I dont even use it . Waste of money : ( He actually prefers the cheap $ 3 one from Petsmart with the thin fine bristles . The bristles on this one are like the ones from a regular hair brush and that doesnt work very well on short cat fur .	-1
I use it for my cat but it does n't work at all . Maybe because she has short hair but anyway it did n't help	-1
The kibble just falls right out of this ball . There is nothing to make it challenging for my Yorkie . He is pretty smart and needs to be challenged or he gets into mischief . After he ate all the kibble , he chewed a hole right through it . I had to dispose of this toy within ten minutes of taking it out of the packaging .	-1
I got this for my Weimaraner and Black Lab puppy . I took it out of the package , filled it with treats and tossed it to the pups . 30 minutes later it had a hole it in large enough for the dog to stick his whole snout in and just eat the treats that way.Might be good for smaller dogs or dogs that are n't chewers , but for larger dogs this ball just is n't tough enough . It 's soft plastic and I have little pieces of it all over the house .	-1
In less than a day our Labradoodle and Pit mix were able to chew through the ball to get the treats . Until that , though , it worked well .	-1
I purchased this Treat Ball to entertain our 7 month old Bernese Mountain Dog while she recovers from being spayed . It arrived today ( quick shipping ) , and we popped it open and filled it with kibble . We set it rolling on the floor , and the kibble fell out in big glumps . Our dogged stepped over the kibble , nosed the ball across the floor , watched more kibble fall out , and walked away . Sooooooooooo not a lot of stimulation there . Now , granted Bernese are not hugely food motivated , but she spends tons of time playing with her Busy BuddyPremier Pet Waggle Dog Toy , Medium/Large . The waggle toy is adjustable for different size treats , and my dog picks it up and throws it around for 15 minutes or so at a time . I suggest going with the waggle toy for a more stimulating toy . I wo n't bother to return this because it just does n't make sense with the shipping costs . I 'll look for some giant treats to fill it with , perhaps that will at least get her to pay attention for a few minutes .	-1
My dog did not like this toy at all for treats or play . She would n't even use it as a regular toy .	-1
The snacks fall out too easily as it is just an open hole but my dog enjoys pushing it around the room.Much prefer the cube .	-1
This was ripped within 5 minutes . Costco had the larger version and my sister got it for her hound . He loves it and it keeps him occupied . This one is small and soft.I have only purchased KONG and Nylabone products in the past and will continue to do so in the future . Lesson learned.Would I buy it again ? No way.If you have a very small , inactive-ish , dog this might work for you .	-1
I bought a case of 12 only to find that my dogs can destroy this thing in 5 minutes flat . I placed dry food inside , which came out relatively easily as it rolled - however my 3 labs are very adept at these kinds of toys . After it was empty , they each easily tore through the plastic to look inside . Not fun ... On a plus side , the orange plastic is easy to spot to clean up . Unfortunately , this ball proved too big for my mother 's small dog - which leaves me to wonder - what 's the perfect dog for this thing ? However , we really like the soft feature , which is nice for inside non-carpeted play . A medium sized dog that is not an aggressive chewer would be the perfect candidate for this toy . For aggressive chewers or sharp-teeth puppies the Buster Food Cube is a better choice and comes in multiple sizes .	-1
I really wanted to like this treat ball because it seemed soft and durable and would n't damage hard floors or walls . However , it is IMPOSSIBLE to clean thoroughly . I am going to ask my husband to drill a larger hole at the bottom for water to drain out easier , but I am really disappointed that it is so difficult to wash and clean out properly .	-1
I 've tried a number of these treat balls , hoping our dachshund would get some indoor exercise this winter.. This one sounds like it 's a smart way to go , but he wo n't play with it and I do n't like it.. It has a really strong plastic odor and when I put treats inside of it , they do n't come out easily.. I would think any dog would get bored with trying to get something out of it , IF you can get them to play with it at all.. Our Champie just sniffs it , then walks away.. I think the plastic odor probably covers the scent of the treat inside , so he 's not even interested in it ... I tried washing it in hot soapy water , but it did n't get rid of the smell ... Plus it took forever to get all the water out of it and get it to dry.. Maybe more playful dogs would enjoy this , or maybe bigger dogs , but for our little guy , he just is n't interested . Waste of money !	-1
We had this toy for three days , and left our dog for 5 minutes and she chewed a hole through the side . She is really tough on her toys , and chews through most of them within a day .	-1
My dog tore this to pieces with an hour	-1
I 've purchased five different food dispensing toys . The 5-inch IQ Treat Ball , the Omega Paw Tricky Treat Ball , Large , the StarMark Interactive toy , and the Premier Pet Busy Buddy Twist N Treat Dog Toy , Medium , and the Premier Pet Busy Buddy Twist N Treat Dog Toy , Large.Please note that you can not clean the insides of the StarMark or the Omega ball . Unless you want old gunk hanging around for months , these two toys will last ... very short . I kept each for only a couple of months before tossing them out . The only two I use to this day are the Premier Pet Buddy , Large , and the IQ Treat Ball.Of all of these , each one has its benefits and shortcomings : The Omega Paw Tricky Treat Ball is the perfect material for my dog - he 's not a huge chewer . It hits the wall and makes a gentle `` thud '' sound . However , with the new design , the hole that dispenses the food is much too large and dispenses a ton of his treats right from the getgo - this is not enough to keep my dog entertained for more than a few minutes ! The Omega Ball fits the most food - I believe I can get up to a full cup of kibbles into it . Note that the only way to clean this toy is to put water in it and shake . I made the mistake of putting dishwashing liquid in it , shaking , and trying to get rid of the suds . It did n't happen - the suds persisted . There 's a tiny air hole on the other side ... not that that helped get rid of the suds . I threw the toy away.The Premier Pet Busy Buddy Twist N Treat Dog Toy , Medium is my least favorite . Whilst it also does not make a lot of noise , you ca n't necessarily control how fast food comes out because it relies on twisting it just right- and when the toy is knocked around , it untwists , and just spills out all the food , too - well , at least makes the hole bigger so food comes out much too fast . This is my least favorite food dispensing toy . The Buddy is also the smallest - you can only fit 1/4 to 1/3 cups of food in here if you seal it tight . The one great thing about this toy is that you can actually clean it.The Premier Pet Busy Buddy Twist N Treat Dog Toy , Large , is my very favorite . It 's sturdy , food comes out at a decent pace and when my dog knocks it around , it does n't cause the opening to get bigger . I can put his entire meal inside this toy ( unlike the medium size ) easily and it 's not a huge balancing act to make sure nothing falls out . I can clean it , and it does n't roll away like the IQ ball into places my dog can not reach . It 's slow rolling so he can guide it easier . Plus , it 's quiet and only makes a gentle thud . No matter the size of your dog , get the large . My dog is a 25-28 pounder . The large is much sturdier than the medium.The StarMark Interactive toy is very large . You can fit a lot of kibbles in there . That 's a bonus . Also , you can make the dispensing method more difficult in two places . However , you can not open the thing to clean it and I certainly would NOT put water in there , as it 's odd shaped , and I really do n't like what may happen if I try to pour water in there and shake . I would highly recommend that you start with this toy rather than one of the balls if you plan on buying a StarMark toy . The reason for this is that my dog was used to rolling or pushing a toy to get his food out . So instead of gently nudging the StarMark toy , he would try to roll it , which ended up being really loud for me . He has never figured out that you just need to push the top to get the food out and just pushed harder to get the thing to roll.Finally , the 5-inch IQ ball is perfect in the sense that it lets you control how fast it dispenses , but it 's SO LOUD . My dog gets all worked up at the ball and gets very aggressive with it because of the loud noises it makes . He reacts to the noises and I think it gives him anxiety . Not to mention all the loud clanging makes ME have anxiety . I 'm worried the neighbors will complain ! Another thing about the IQ ball is that because it rolls so easily and fast and furious when my dog pushes it and it is so small , it often goes under a piece of furniture so that my dog ca n't reach it . So much for keeping my dog distracted so I can do other things - I often have to get up and get the ball for him out from underneath a piece of furniture . This was not a problem once for the Premier Pet Busy Buddy Twist N Treat Dog Toy and not so much for the Omega ball because it rolls more slowly and when my dog pushes it , it does n't travel that far . Obviously this is not a problem for the StarMark toy , as that toy is quite large.Finally , the IQ ball only fits about a 1/2 cup of kibbles . There is a white enclosure to manage the dispensing of food . You can fit another 1/4 cup above the white enclosure , but it 's a pain because you have to make sure none spills over to the side before twisting - hard to explain , but trust me , it 's a pain . 3/4 cup of kibbles max , and only a 1/2 cup is easily put in .	-1
This is a great concept . The ball looks fun , the dents in it make it easy for a dog to pick up and toss around . However , it is not made to withstand even moderate chewing . The second my dog got a hold of it she decided that rolling it around to get the treats out was for chumps . Within 2 minutes she had chewed through the sides and got them out her way . So the ball goes into the trash along with all the little pieces that she chewed off of it . She normally is n't a terrible chewer , but this ball really did n't stand up too well against her .	-1
I filled it with kibble and our dogs got working on rolling it around . I walked away for 30 seconds . I came back and there was a hole in it . My dogs get feeder toys all the time , and they are quite good at using them but this was so easy to tear apart our doberman went for the path of least resistance . It happened so incredibly fast . Just one purposeful bite.If your dog is n't a big chewer , maybe it would be great . Or maybe for a small dog who could n't get a good bite on a toy this large . I liked that it was soft , so it did n't make loud noises when it hit the walls . Too bad it did n't last one whole day .	-1
Our Jack Russell is 9 years old . We bought him one of these from Petco when he was a puppy . He had this treat ball for 8 years . It finally started getting beat up so we bought him a new one , the same exact thing we bought 8 years ago . We noticed immediately that the material is thinner and more flexible . He has destroyed this new one in less than 6 months . He does n't chew on it , he picked it up by the hole and brings it to us and asks that we fill it . Just carrying it around in his mouth from time to time has cracked it and broken the plastic down to where the hole is ruined , treats will no longer stay in it , they just fall out immediately . We are ordering him another treat ball of a different brand .	-1
Thought this was a great idea to occupy my little dog while alone or just having a & # 34 ; smart toy & # 34 ; . Maybe it would be if the plastic ball did n't smell so bad . Very strong chemical/perfume odor . Washed it with soap and hot water , let it & # 34 ; sit & # 34 ; out , still stinks . Dog is uninterested in toy , even when stuffed with his favorite goodies . Waste of money .	-1
Perfect size ball , perfect size hole , bad material . Might work great if your dog never chews . Mine did and destroyed it in the first hour .	-1
I bought the small Omega Trick Ball and can honestly say it 's the worst treat dispenser I 've purchased . : - ( Basically , it 's an overpriced piece of plastic ; has nothing interesting in the design , except for the `` bubble design '' on the exterior.There are a lot better options out there for a few more dollars , such as the Tug-a-Jug , Dog Pyramid , Buster Cube , and plain ol ' Kong ... all available on Amazon.com.I seldom regret buying my dog anything , but this toy is a total waste of hard-earned money . This is a total ripoff.Spend a few more dollars and buy something truly worthwhile .	-1
My Straffordshire Terrier destroyed this within a short time . This wo n't work for dogs who like to chew , not durable enough .	-1
My dog is n't a chewer , but he managed to tear open the ball around the hole after playing with it for 30 minutes . Our dog is n't a chewer , so I was shocked that the ball held up so poorly . At the same time , I also purchased Ourpets Smarter Toys IQ Treat Ball and he loves that . I would recommend if you are thinking of getting your dog something to for your dog to play with that gives out kibbles , to go with that product instead .	-1
I got this for my ball loving dog . In less than 5 minutes of receiving the box and getting it out of the packaging there was a hole torn in it . He is n't the type of dog to destroy anything . The ball has a smell to it of vanilla or some sort that must have made him destroy it . Looks like only Chuck-it balls from here on out . A definite waste of money .	-1
The hole is much too large for most kibbled dog food . I bought this as a replacement for a lost feeding ball looks the same as the one in the picture . They are not the same . The hole in this new ball is much larger . It used to take Rusty about ten minutes to empty his old ball , but only about a quick minute for this one.The whole point is for the treat ball to be `` tricky '' , as in this ball 's name . There 's no trick and no fun in this one .	-1
The main problem I have with this litterbox is that my cat moves the litter around and does her business directly on the bottom of the box . When you roll it , some clumps stick to the bottom and the only way to get them off is to pound on the bottom of the box until the clumps come loose . I also purchased the litter mat that works with this box , and although there is litter on the mat , it 's getting tracked through the entire room and that 's quite gross . So I am not as impressed as I thought I would be . Also , this can be in no way a self cleaning litterbox . Something such as a Littermaid is way more self cleaning than this one . The regular Omega litterbox ( RA15 ) is quite small and needs to be rolled and emptied every couple of days with one cat . With a Littermaid litterbox and only having one cat , I only needed to dump the receptacle once a week . After having owned a Littermaid for two years prior to buying this one , I think the Littermaid works better . I never used liners with my littermaid , I used plastic grocery bags with the receptacles . My only complaint with uncovered litterboxes is that litter still gets scattered outside of the box . I did go through one Littermaid Cabana and one Littermaid tent ( both poorly made and neither did n't hold up ) . So I read the reviews on the Omega Paw and sold my Littermaid on ebay . I miss it dearly . This one creates more work than what other reviewers are saying .	-1
I apologize in advance for daring a different opinion and even having to face the possibility of being fired upon by people who say & # 34 ; Do n't review an item you have n't even tried & # 34 ; ( I would normally agree with them ) , I still have to wonder how a person with some common sense would believe this is a great concept . Imagine your only place of relief is an outhouse and the idea of cleaning it is to turn it around , hoping whatever was left inside will magically fall out . No , I do not own this product , nor would I ever entertain the idea - not for the sake of my wallet , but for the sake of my cat 's health and well-being . I 've seen this product in action and was disgusted by the fact that your kitty 's urine and feces get scrambled about in a possibly well-meant yet useless attempt to remove them . This litter box design ensures that residue of whatever your kitties have left on the bottom of the litter pan for you to clean up will inevitably cling to its walls and the ceiling . Who would want to revisit that & # 34 ; luxury spa & # 34 ; ? I guess , if you 're a cat and do n't have a choice it 's either that , or the couch . I understand that owning a cat is having to put up with the litter box in the house , but honestly I 'd rather spend 5 minutes a day scooping poop and pee than submitting my pet which is ultimately part of my family to such unsanitary conditions that this product promotes . O'Hana !	-1
I 'm going to give my 100 % honest opinion of this litter box.I got this back in October . At first I wrote a beaming review saying how great it was , but really I think it was just the novelty factor . I liked not having to scoop . I ignored any issues this litter box had because I thought `` Nothing can be worse than scooping '' , but I was wrong.I will list all the problems I encountered:1 ) The litter box is actually small . I got the `` Large '' size , but you need to realize that the grate takes up HALF the box . So what is left for your cat to actually stand in , is a very small area . The dimensions of the litter box are correct , but that is n't taking into account how much room the grate takes up.2 ) I could never find a litter that worked well enough . I tried Fresh Step , Special Kitty ( Walmart ) , Arm & Hammer , Tidy Cats , even Dr. Elsey 's Ultra Precious Litter ( which is now my favorite litter btw , but not for this litter box ) . When you roll the box , you 're breaking up poo balls and pee balls that are slipped right through the grate and do n't make it into the collection tray . I would have to roll it , empty the tray , roll it back , and then manually take out all the bits the grate missed.3 ) Pee balls stick to the bottom of the litter box . Even when I had 3-4 inches of litter in there , they would somehow make it to the bottom . I would even spray Pam cooking spray on the bottom and it did n't work . I 'd have to roll the box and SLAM on the bottom to dislodge the pee balls , and that would make a separate mess all together . Not to mention most of the pee balls would still be stuck to the bottom of the box.4 ) Poop would constantly get stuck to the grate . Do n't even get me started on this one.5 ) As much as I hate to admit it , and I believe a lot of reviewers are in denial about this , but this litter box is very unsanitary . When you roll the box , all the dirty litter rolls alllllll around the sides and the top of the box . The litter box is literally coated with dirty litter dust . Then the cat walks in , brushes his fur all around the box . Blech . It 's unsanitary.6 ) A lot of times for no obvious reason when I 'd roll the box , some pee balls and poop would n't make it into the collection tray , but UNDER it . So I 'd have to go get a paper towel and grab what was missed . Very very annoying and defeats the entire purpose.7 ) For no reason at all , extra litter gets collected in the collection tray . CLEAN litter . No matter how slow I rolled the box , and even when I had just 3 inches of litter . This wasted sooooooooooo much litter . I was refilling the litter box SO often to get it back to the fill line.8 ) Pain in the butt to clean . So many parts you have to clean and dry.9 ) Flimsy clasps . They never broke on me , but each time I 'd close them , they felt like they were going to snap off . Cheap plastic.10 ) Grate is made of flimsy plastic . No doubt in a few more months it would have snapped in 2.11 ) Box gets heavy to tilt and roll when a lot of litter is in there . The whole thing is cumbersome . You need to have A LOT of room to tilt and roll it.I 'm sure I can think of other things I dislike about this box . I only had it for 2 months and this is what I encountered . Keep in mind I have 2 cats and would clean the box AT LEAST once a day . I really wanted to like this litter box . I have recently switched back to a regular box . I do n't hate scooping nearly as much as I previously thought I did . I have since realized that regular scooping is much easier and less time consuming than the Omega Paw roll n ' clean litter box .	-1
Like the title says , I really wanted to like this product like so many others did but I had so many issues with it that I ended up just switching to your plain ol ' litter box . If you want to know specifically why I DO NOT recommend this then read on:1 ) The & # 34 ; vent & # 34 ; on the inside does not clip sturdily into the bottom of the pan . So after a few times of rolling it the vent piece actually popped up and trapped waste behind it which required a complete disassembly to get it out.2 ) Sticky clumpy litter- I tried three totally different types of litter with this box and I had the same problem with all of them : they stuck to the box , or they clumped together too much in the small pan space so when I rolled the box they would dislodge suddenly and fill the pull out tray with a lot of & # 34 ; clean & # 34 ; litter as well as the soiled stuff . What a waste.3 ) The useable pan size is way too small so kitty could n't properly cover her waste . I thought she just did n't like to cover it until I switched to an open top box and realized that she will dig and dig and dig . The reason her being able to cover is so important is because it really cuts down on the smell that is released.4 ) The cheap clips . After reading the reviews I was so hesitant to even undo them because they feel so flimsy and breakable.5 ) Overall cleanliness . I just felt like the whole box was soiled after a week or two of use .	-1
Hard to clean , very messy because there is n't a door-so the litter goes everywhere . I tried hooded , regular , special ... you name it . I still use it because I have 3 kittens , but I am going to get the Van Ness instead ...	-1
I had really high expectations and thought this was the coolest concept . But no.Even with the best litter in the world - Mr. Elsey 's - it does not truly scoop out all the poop . Yes , I roll it several times , make sure everything is tightly fitted , etc . I have read millions of reviews so I know I am using it correctly . But I have a kitten and some of the clumps are small . In that case it goes right through the grid and does n't make it up into the scoop . So I ca n't get absolutely every piece unless I reach my hand in there with a scoop . Gross . And defeats the purpose.Also consider the fact that every time you roll it ( if you do it correctly it will almost be upside down ) there will be tiny bits of dust/debris flying onto ceiling inside the litter box . I do n't think that 's hygenic for my cat - beyond the fact that she probably touches the filter grid on which the clumps rest before rolling into the scoop.So it 's gross for me and my cat . AND my cat now has coccydia so I need to sterilize everything ESPECIALLY the litterbox with bleach . Yeah , this one does n't work with a liner so I fashioned one out of layering two torn garbage bags and masking tape . Fun stuff.I 'm switching back to a good , old-fashioned litter-box .	-1
This & # 34 ; regular & # 34 ; size is n't even big enough for our small cat to get in a turn around . Probably would only be useful for kittens . Most of the interior size is taken up by the disposal system . I would HIGHLY recommend getting the large size for ANY size cat you have . We knew when we put this one together , it was n't going to work so we packed it right back up and are returning it . We have ordered the larger one . The system looks like a terrific idea and we are looking forward to getting the big one so see how large it really is.I was surprised that Prime , which ships for no charge and has allowed returns at no charge in the past is actually deducting the return shipping from my refund even though I am purchasing the bigger one ... .never had this happen before ... change in Prime policy maybe ?	-1
This is the biggest rip-off device ever . It does n't work like it 's supposed to and is just a hassle . Clever TV marketing . Sorry implementation.Do n't do it .	-1
I bought this based on the high reviews - and the concept . It seems like this is what I needed . It was easy to put together . My kitties took a few days to get used to it - but did use it afer awhile so that was not the issue . It worked well the first few days - but basically stopped working after about a week . The poop and pee-balls did n't go into the tray and stayed in the main litter compartment . The little drawer-tray filled with clean litter intead . So I ended up removing the pieces and using it as a regular litter box . So . . . do n't waste your money !	-1
The disposal drawer is n't larger/wide enough for clumped urine . I ended up throwing the plastic liter filter away and just scooping the liter by hand - using it as a covered literbox . Rolling the literbox was n't as good in practice as it first sounded either .	-1
It 's not as big as it seems since the only side he can move around in is the left side because of the filter in the middle . When he goes inside and kicks litter , it goes out of the box and onto the floor in considerable amounts . The first time I used it , half of the litter got out of the box . Having the option of a door would fix this problem . I really have to get another litter box .	-1
I have tried two different sizes of this litter box and have the same problem with both- when you roll the box , lots of loose litter comes out in between the seams . It is great at quickly getting all the poop out so you do n't have to pick it out , but then there is a big pile of litter on the floor . Also , the binder/clasps on my large size box did not line up well with the slots so that I had to use a wrench to pull the binder shut . Way too much hassle .	-1
I thought this was a wonderful idea for a litter box . I wound up throwing it away after a few months of use . Cleaning the drawer was messy . Lots of litter was wasted . I went back to using a traditional litter box .	-1
I 've been tending a friend 's kitties while she 's out of town , and she has one of these boxes . I 've become intimately familiar with it in the last week.Firstly , the thing is huge ( huge ! ) , so you must have extra space . The interior space is smaller than that of a regular cat box , even the 'large ' size . Multiple cats fill it quickly.Secondly , imagine if you will , how heavy a giant box full of wet litter is . Now imagine wrestling a plastic bin full of wet cat litter out of its spot , ROLLING the thing over on its head and back again . Heavy . Watch your back.Thirdly , you must pull the box out of its spot to roll it , and guaranteed , you 'll spill some litter on the floor , which the box then rolls on , and grinds into the floor , and on to its own top . So you will have some cleanup to do.Fourthly , and perhaps most importantly , is that anyone who has ever had cats and used clumping litter knows , sometimes the clumps of pee nearly fuse to the sides of the box , and have to be chipped off ( even if you 're rolling the box upside down and back ) . Well , there 's no really good way to a ) see this in the dark depths of the box or b ) reach in and scrape the clumps off the sides . The box does n't get totally clean , and the stinky clump remains . Do n't be fooled by the small opening- it serves as a chimney for cat stink , and seems to concentrate and focus odors right out toward your nose ! Fifthly ( is that proper ? ) , filling the box is a pain , because the lid does n't come off . You 're going to have to pour it in the door , or use a small scoop a thousand times to fill it . Your cat is n't exactly going to rake the huge pile of litter from just inside the door , like a tiny , poopy zen garden . There is no way to avoid reaching in to the box completely . You 'll have to , to even out the litter , or to scoop the stalagmites.I guess if you are a person who conflates gimmicky , perceived ease of use over simple scooping , and over your cats ' comfort and ease , get this litter box . Otherwise , skip it . Actually , just skip it .	-1
It takes too much space and is not easy to clean . I think a new design is in order for my tastes . My cat was not particular about this box either .	-1
ACTUALLY ENDED UP SENDING IT BACK , WOULD N'T FIT IN MY SPACE . I 'M SURE THIS HAS A GOOD USE , JUST NOT FOR ME .	-1
The box is OK for those days when you just do n't have time to clean out the box . Just tilt the box over to the side until you do n't hear any more chunks falling to the top , then tilt it back and the chunks get deposited into the waste removal basket and the sand slides back into the part the kitty uses . Takes about 30 seconds to clean the cat box . You can get the big chunks cleaned out , but you do n't really get the sand very clean . It 's full of waste and some of the chunks are n't so small . I still have to clean it at least twice a week the old fashion way.The cat box is HUGE and requires a lot of space to roll it over . I have to move it out of my service porch to roll it , yet the part the cat uses is not very big in comparison , and I have the large box for a single , small cat.It 's really messy . When I roll it , even though it is closed and locked properly , it gets litter all over . When the cat uses the box he kicks sand out all the time . There is a huge mess every time . I wish there was some kind of flap on the front to keep the sand from getting all over.All in all , If I had it to do over , I would n't spend the money . It 's a great idea . I do n't think it needs to be so tall . It would be easier to handle if it were n't . I wish the screen was smaller so it would clean the sand better , and the doggy door kind of flap to keep the sand in the box better.UPDATE : after a couple month of using this box , I 've gone back to my standard cat box . This just does n't clean the litter well enough , and it 's so messy , It 's just easier to do it manually .	-1
This is a very bulky item when both parts are connected . With a bad back and the weight of a litter-filled box , the rolling was not going to work for me . I use the bottom part of the box alone as a regular litter pan . I suppose the top could be another litter pan ; there does n't seem to be any difference in the strength of the plastic . Maybe this would be a good solution for someone else .	-1
I was so excited to see the UPS man drive up with package- as soon as I found this listed as an easier and cleaner way to handle my litter box , I just had to have- arrived very soon , just opened package , follow instructions and all that was needed was to bend screen , snap securely in place and put cover on- screen bend snapped into 2 pieces as soon as I bent it as directed . I am so angry right now I do not even know how to express my thoughts . I do not drive which is why I ordered this online , to open , have product break , follow these stupid return instructions , be available for the pick up and have to wait further for my `` convenience '' of having a cleaner more sanitary litter box . I am disappointed in the box and Amazon and question my future shopping with them.Extremely unhappy customer-Amy Beth Carducci	-1
This Omega Paw self cleaning litter box is NOT sturdy ! The parts that snap together do NOT fit , and if they fit would be very easily to break off . and to operate the box , you have to turn it ... and it just is NOT a good product !	-1
I had hoped that the novelty of the clever design would make an onorous chore a little less `` gross '' , but in all the time I tried it I was , variously , disappointed , annoyed and disgusted . The shell is of a plastic that is n't nearly strong enough for it 's task , the little clasp/slides that attach the shells together are flimsy at best , and litter leaked everywhere even when I managed to get the clasp/slides firmly closed . I stopped rocking it after the third collapse and just used it as a regular hooded box.I also saw a cat expert say that cats find it to be a big `` wrong '' if they go into a space that has the scent of urine everywhere ( especially above their heads ) . In the simple action of rolling it the previous scent spreads out all over it . So no , I do NOT recommend this to anyone . Maybe others managed to make it work , but mine went out to the curb after too many failures . And no , you ca n't return it if it 's been used .	-1
With all the raving reviews , I was so anticipating this litter box 's arrival . But it is a huge letdown . It is not the be all end all of all litter boxes as I had previously thought . I actually hate it , as it has given me way more work than I had to do before ! Before I go on , let me just say I had no problem with clips or getting it to work like some of the other bad reviews on here . I dislike it because I was using a covered litter box , with a in/out flap , so I NEVER had issues with litter flying everywhere . This box , the opening is too wide and too close to the floor that litter flies everywhere . So much so , that I find I listen for every time he goes potty so I can sweep up the litter everywhere . It 's horrible , and I bought this cause I thought it would cut my work in half and all it did was double and even possibly triple it . Some other minor dislikes are that the box is so huge , yet the actual size he go 's potty in is soooo small . Honestly , it 's really gigantic and ugly , even in a large bathroom . I think this litter box would be improved 100 fold if it had one of those swingy doors attached to keep the litter from flying . I do n't even know if it 's possible , but in the coming weeks , I 'm going to see if I can incorporate one somehow._____________________________LITTER_____________________________Oh and on a side note : I had purchased 2 different litters per someone else 's review and my advice is do n't buy them . They 're horrible.The first one I bought was : Swheat Scoop Multi Cat Natural Wheat Cat Litter , 25 Pound Bag ( http : //www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001VIWHG0 ) and it sticks to his fur , his tail and his feet , like static cling and gets it all through the house ... not just the bathroom.The second one I bought was : Northeastern Products Cedarific Natural Cedar Chips Cat Litter , 50 Liter Bag ( http : //www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000084EVX ) and this not only sticks to him as well but smells like a gerbal cage . You know their bedding . I really thought cedar would have smelled better like pine or something . Not so ... .not so ... I would highly recommend a different litter . After these are finished , I will be trying other brands.____________________________Here is the review I had used to purchase the litter from : copied from -- > ( http : //www.amazon.com/Omega-Paw-Self-Cleaning-Litter-Large/product-reviews/B0002DK2DU/ref=cm_cr_pr_link_next_2 ? ie=UTF8 & showViewpoints ; =0 & pageNumber ; =2 & sortBy ; =bySubmissionDateDescending ) ____________________________5.0 out of 5 stars The Magic Litterbox Combo ! , February 28 , 2011ByAngela Brookman ( Fayetteville , NC , US ) - See all my reviewsAmazon Verified Purchase ( What 's this ? ) This review is from : Omega Paw Self-Cleaning Litter Box , Large , Green and Beige ( Misc . ) I 've done it ! ! ! I 've finally figured out the magic formula for an odorless , easy to maintain litter box ! However , before I divulge my magic formula , I must launch into an intro : First of all , I have four cats , 2 of them are large males whose life purposes are to poop and pee , apparently . We used to have a hooded litter box . We progressed from using regular clumping litter to using non-clumping then we switched to World 's Best Cat Litter . Cost-wise , a similar brand called Exquisicat was better for us . After a while though , I noticed that the corn litter would start getting this smell . I can only describe it as a `` dirty barnyard '' stench . It did n't matter how many times we scooped in a day , after a few days , the corn litter would adopt that smell.About three weeks ago , I finally threw up my hands and told myself that I would go on the hunt for the perfect way to cure this litterbox problem . My den smelled like a barn , scooping took forever and it was making me unhappy . I spent hours poring over the reviews on Amazon . I made a purchase of three items totalling almost a hundred dollars ! But you know what ? My den no longer smells bad , the kitties are happy and it takes less than three minutes to clean out the litterbox.First , I purchased this litter : Swheat Scoop Multi Cat Natural Wheat Cat Litter , 25 Pound Bag Now , I would like to note that the formula I concocted involved mixing this litter with cedar kitty litter : Northeastern Products Cedarific Natural Cedar Chips Cat Litter , 50 Liter Bag Those two together provide major odor control ! I simply placed about two to three inches of the wheat litter in the Omega litter box with about two to three cups of the cedar litter . The Omega Paw is awesome too ! I just roll it then the clumps end up in this receptacle that I simply dump into the toilet and flush away ! I think the key to this litter box is to make sure there is n't too much litter in the box , otherwise , it will have a hard time sifting through and separating the clumps from the clean litter . As for the tabs , a gentle touch is a must in keeping it together . Get a feel for how the tabs slide and squeeze down then slide to the appropriate direction . There 's no reason for it to break if you treat it gently.As for spilt litter , if you make sure all the tabs are locked properly , there should be no reason for litter to escape the box .	-1
The medium is okay , but the large is a waste of money , the sliding clips do n't work right , some do n't line up at all and they break off in no time .	-1
My cat tends to urinate a fair quantity which creates larger chunks which then get stuck in the & # 34 ; drawer & # 34 ; that catches these . Also , in the past I have used liners so the cat box does n't soak up the smell of urine and also so that the chunks dislodge easier against a liner . Since you ca n't use a liner in this pan , some of the chunks get attached to the bottom of the pan.I 'm not so thrilled with this and will most likely send it to goodwill for some other person to maybe have success .	-1
We have used this for a few months now , and I am reasonably pleased with it . I read dozens of reviews on Amazon , and gleaned a bunch of useful tips regarding , for example , the clips , which some complained were easy to break . Ensuring careful alignment of the 4 clips is vital before you lock them into place.We have six cats , including a 15 lb Havana Brown , and use four litter trays with inexpensive ( Big Lots ) , unperfumed , $ 4.00 per 14lb jug , of clumping litter . All cats took to this tray immediately.. novelty , mebbe ! After a few weeks they are using all covered trays equally.The first time I rolled the box , I had urine seep out on to the wood floor . To be fair , this only happened once . I do have one boy who wees standing up , and although the urine does not leak out of the `` join '' between upper and lower , I do have to remove the lid most days and clean down the sides of the box , and along the join , as I do with all of them anyway . The same cat will occasionally turn around and wee through the entrance from time to time , which is why I will also recommend the PetFusion Smart Grip Litter Mat ( see my review ) from Amazon : PetFusion SmartGrip Cat Litter Mat ( Gray and White ) This mat is such a good product that I ended getting four of them ! Probably my main gripe with this litter box is that it is too short from front to back.. my large Havana Brown can get in and then has a heck of a job turning around and positioning himself to use it comfortably . Sometimes he will give up and head for another box . The toileting compartment IS considerably smaller than my other litter boxes.Also , my cats DO sometimes wee on the grid , and yes , it will smell after a day or two ! And yes , it 's a bugger to clean ! When this has happened , I have removed the litter , dismantled the box , and used the hose to wash it down thoroughly before drying and re-assembling it . I have done this twice so far , and it is fairly time-consuming . When the cold weather hits , this will be an impossible task.. and no , I refuse to wash it down in the spa tub ( the only receptable large enough for this box ! ) .This is how I personally perform the empty : Roll the box to the right until it is almost on its side . The unused litter can be seen/heard passing through the grid and the clumps and poo will move beyond the grid ( mostly.. small ones from my petite Siamese girl DO sometimes get through with the clean litter ) . At this time , I peer into the box and check to see if any clumps have stuck to the sides or floor of the tray . If they have , then I whack the outside with my hand to loosen them . I then complete the movement , slowly turning the tray on to its roof . I wait until the movement of litter has stopped and start to rotate it back to the left , gently . By doing everything slowly , it avoids the clumps breaking up before they get to the colection receptacle . When around 50 % of the litter has moved back into the `` cubicle '' area , then I remove the receptacle and empty it into a plastic bag ( those thin grey Walmart plastic carrier bags are the best as they generally do n't have any holes in them ) before moving on to my next litter box . I replace the receptacle and tilt the box to the left , holding it , until most of the clean litter has moved back into the cubicle area . I then place the box level and use a scoop to level the surface.UPDATE : It has been several months and I really am fed up with the high maintenance of this litter box . I DO find it messy and it has gotten very smelly . I have hosed it down outside and it still has a uriney smell . I will not be able to do this in winter of course ! None of my other hooded boxes have given me a smell problem.. and the oldest is still going after 6 years . I am replacing it with another of the two I bought recently off E-Bay that are a doddle to move around with four side clips and a handy carrying handle .	-1
Initially seemed like a good idea , but then I noticed the cats started to stink ! The tabs are too flimsy to disassemble , clean it , and reassemble . Several snapped off . Clumped , dirty litter got stuck in the grate that was supposed to filter out the waste . I do think the cats liked the cave-like feel of it , but when you think about how the tumbling coats the walls with urine and feces , it 's kind of gross	-1
I threw this out after just a couple of weeks , the littler sticks to the walls and big clumps are stuck to the ceiling , I ca n't have that falling on my cat when she 's trying to do her stuff . Awful invention !	-1
If I could return this , I would . What a waste of money -- I read all the reviews on it before buying , and was excited to try it . I assembled it and put litter in it , and the next day decided to try it out . I rolled it like the directions said , and litter leaked out all over the carpet , even though I triple-checked the locks and they were all sealed . I had rolled it until it was laying on its top , and then rolled it back . It only picked up the poop , and not all of it . Clumps of urine were still in the box . I had to vacuum the floor afterwards . It ended up causing me more trouble than anything ! I do n't remember the last time I was so disappointed in a product I ordered off Amazon , especially one with such high reviews.I ended up removing the grate and scoop and turning it into a plain , large litter box for our two cats . I 'm glad they at least have a roomier box . I do n't recommend this product at all ... do n't waste your money .	-1
My cat needed a larger box , so i got this thinking it would work . It lasted about a day . He refused to use it and pooped on the floor . Awesome .	-1
So it is a flimsy grill that flops off . We had to put it back on already and had it for 1 day only . Things are getting in the grill as well and becoming stuck . The 'lock ' of the litter box is lame and pieces of litter do come out if you roll sometimes . We also had to watch what we were doing while rolling . This is a huge hassle we already went back to our old litter box . In addition , we attempted to return the item the shipping was $ 35 ! ! So it 's just a wash for us a waste of $ and time and headache . Save yourselves time ! We gave up after 2 days .	-1
I 'll keep it short , folks , its a litter box , and its like all the rest as far as smells go . If you do n't clean it often , its gon na smell , even with the high quality odor eliminating litter ! And you HAVE TO USE A QUALITY CLUMPING CAT LITTER in this design , I would hate to see the outcome if you did n't ! The design , where you tip it way over and then back to easily collect the clumps in the drawer , is pretty good but would have been a lot better if the box had been constructed in a way that did n't feel so cheap and flimsy . I mean it works good , but will it hold up to numerous uses and openings and closings ? That is where I have my doubts , as the THIN plastic slide locks that lock the top to the bottom are very generic and sometimes you have to work to get them to actually latch . And the box is somewhat divided inside due to the litter screen that is supposed to keep the good litter in and the clumps over to the slide out tray . I would say as big as it looks on the outside , and we got the biggest one , the actual 'potty area ' is a tad smaller than a normal open box , so barely room for a cat to turn around , much less cover the potty the way they like . Sometimes my cat actually exits the box to turn around and get at the area to cover up ! In summary , I like the overall design of the clump removal system but they should have put more quality into the construction and the the actual area the cat uses should be a lot bigger . Considering those factors I would say its a bit overpriced .	-1
I have exclusively used electronic automatic self cleaning boxes , litter maid and Litter Robot , since i got our cat in the early mid 90s . Circumstances caused me to have to move temporarily to where i could not bring the Litter Robot and i was financially strapped and did not want to buy another electronic Litter Maid.I expected the situation to be temporary and i wanted to try just scooping litter from a box . However , after all these years of never having to think about litter for at least a week or two or more thanks to the automatic boxes , i could not remember to scoop the litter . The box is upstairs out of the way buy an exit -- that 's the whole idea , having it as out of sight and out of mind as possible , who wants to think about raw sewage in their home ? So i could not remember to do it . Or i would remember but it would be after i got home from work and i was really tired and i would procrastinate and then forget.So i was looking on Amazon to see if there was a compromise , an easier way to scoop once a day that i would n't be so avoidant of , and this Omega Paw seemed to be the one with the best reviews and the description sounded pretty good , just roll it over , pull out the drawer , throw it away.It never worked that way for me . I bought it directly at a Petco store , the regular size , i just have a 6 pound 17 year old cat ( now 18 ) .It was cheap compared to the electronic boxes , the one good thing about it.It was easy to assemble and i was one of the lucky ones , the clips fastened easily and tightly , it was solid once assembled.I bought the kind of clumping litter my cat was already used to from the regular scooping litter box i was using . I do n't remember now what kind it was . I had tried Worlds Best Clumping litter but she hated it for some unknown reason and proceeded to pee on the bathroom rug , something she never did before . ( With the electronic boxes i have always used litter pearls or other crystals , which do n't clump ) .the first thing i did n't like about the Omega Paw was the amount of space it took to roll it . Im used to large cat boxes , the electronic ones are not compact , but the need to roll it required me to have to move it out of its space to find enough space to roll it . Cumbersome . Annoying.But the worst problem was that it did n't do what it 's supposed to do . Absolutely no clumps ever went into the little box or tray . i eagerly rolled it , following the instructions , then expectantly opened the tray but there was nothing in there , just some litter crumbs , no clumps . I rolled it several times and tapped on it and shook it , but no clumps fell into the little tray . The sifting screen seemed too fine to allow the clumps through . I was mystified , it must be something i was doing wrong because other people get them to work as described . I could n't do it . And if i could n't get the clumps out of the cat box , then the cat would n't use it.This was about a year ago . I ended up buying another Litter Maid . I threw the Omega Paw away.I do n't know if this is related to why the Omega Paw would n't work , but after getting the Litter Maid , i came to realize my cat 's previously diagnosed Hyperthyroid condition was causing her to have a very high volume of urine . In retrospect , i do n't know . I did n't know at the time so i do n't know if that was preventing normal clumps from forming . It turned out to be too much urine for the new Litter Maid but it took me a long time to figure out that this was the cause of having to completely change the litter in the LItter Maid more often than once a week.I took her to the vet and i researched on the internet and finally got it figured out about the excessive urination and her medication has been increased and this has improved a lot . But during this long ordeal , about the time the medication was increased , she began refusing to use the Litter Maid at all any more , peeing on the 30 gallon garbage can liners i had spread out on the floor under the litter maid instead , causing a very bad odor . Even when she started urinating less , she refused to use it , i imagine the odor would no longer come out of the box when i changed out the litter and wiped it down.At that point , i decided to try a ScoopFree electronic box and it 's worked so well , i am ready to start a religion and worship it . But while the box itself is not expensive for that type of box ( electronic ) , actually less expensive and very simple , the upkeep is expensive , you have to replace the litter trays periodically and depending on the cat , it could be as often as once a week or up to a month , they cost $ 15 . But there is a work around for that , you , can buy a permanent tray from another company and buy your own litter at Target and then it 's not expensive anymore.fyi , if your cat is hyperthyroid or if he/she pees a lot more than average , that might cause the Omega Paw not to function as described . I do n't know , but think it could be a possibility . Why it did n't work at all for me remains a mystery , why there were no clumps in the tray , or very few , while the rest remained in Omega Paw.In sum , for Omega Paw : Pros : cheaper than an electronic boxmine did assemble correctly and easilyCons : takes a lot of space to rollhard to cleana lot of workdid n't work at all	-1
Good idea , but just too heavy for most people . My husband is strong enough to turn the box so the clumps go into the removable box . Three cats ( three litter boxes ) and the job to take care of them is mine since I 'm & # 34 ; stay at home & # 34 ; and my husband works over 8 hours a day . So unless you 're strong , I do n't recommend it . Sorry .	-1
I should have known that I was being duped when I received this and the packaging material that came with it contained a picture of what was supposed to represent the design team . It should a group of people studying a blueprints and one of them was wearing a white lab coat . The implication was that scientists in white lab coats were needed to develop this . Right ... Anyway , while many people seem to like this product , I am not a fan . While the concept of this seems good , in practice it does not live up to its expectations . There are two major issues I have.First , this thing leaks litter when you do the cleaning procedure of rolling it over , even with all of the locks closed . It 's much messier than cleaning a standard box with a scoop . I had to vacuum the area after each `` cleaning . `` Second , large clumps of litter cling to the bottom , so rolling it does not cause the dirty litter to fall into the scoop as intended . Ideally this would have some sort of non-stick surface on the bottom , or at least a surface that discouraged the litter from clinging to it . Litter stick like glue to this thing . The only way I could get this to work was go bang on it while turning it over to free the litter clumps , although this made the mess problem described above even worse.Yes , I did try several different brands of litter and I had the same two problems with each.I ended removing the scoop and other non-essential stuff from inside and using this as a standard ( albeit very expensive ) regular litter box I now clean with a regular hand scoop.The concept behind this seems good , but in practice it does not work . I tried it for several weeks thinking it would improve , or I would get better at using it but the problems remained . The box created more work for me , instead of making things easier . Although some people seem to like it , I can not recommend it .	-1
I read a lot of glowing reviews for this box . I ran right out and got one . Bad idea . I liked it OK for the first day , but then the problems and failings became pretty evident.First off I could n't get the large box , so I got the regular one . I do n't think the large one would have been big enough either . I have a 3 month old kitten who is fairly small and the box was just about big enough for her at her current size.I have a 6 month old kitten who looks full grown and there is no way in heck this was going to work for him . He would go in and his butt would be hanging out the opening and he would n't even be hitting the box.Then there comes the 2 inches of litter . Well think about it . 2 inches of litter in a tiny box is n't enough for one cat , much less 2 . I suppose this would work if you rolled it after every duty , but how helpful is that ? ? Now comes the rolling part . No matter how I did it I still ended up throwing out some perfectly good litter that had sifted into the drawer with each roll.Consequently I now have 35.00 litter box that is 3 days old and will never be used again . i went back to a regular box and sifting liners that I can do every other day or so . Save your money !	-1
... IF you have a room big enough to roll it over easily ... we had it in our powder room , and I had to sort of lift and roll it in place , because the box is almost as wide as the room ! Because of the way the lid attaches to the base , our younger cat - who sprays when she pees - sprayed a lot onto the join between box and lid , and it leaked out and ran down under the box . Which meant every time I went in to `` roll '' the litter box , there was pee all down the outside to deal with , as well ... .IF you do not have a cat who puts his front half into the box and does his business out on the floor . We had n't known our older cat was this type of box user , until we got the Omega . Apparently he does n't like going all the way into a closed litter box.Now we have another disused litter box piled up in the garage . Omega , Breeze , and regular deep pan style . I have a feeling that the sifting box ( which we got after trying the Omega ) is soon going to end up on that pile too ... but that 's another review entirely .	-1
Gross , messy , time-consuming . You really have to thump it around to get litter clumps moving . It 's really messy rolling the thing around . I went back to twenty seconds a day of scooping a normal litter box .	-1
I used this litterbox for about 3 months before it fell apart , leaving a crevice for the litter to fall out of when tilted . Not so great ! It did work well at first , and was a low-cost alternative to any automatic litterboxes . But the mess after it broke . . .	-1
Naw SOOOO disappointed.it dosent work as instructed.The 'clumps ' dont release themselves and you end up throwing lots of viable product.Darn.It looked so promising !	-1
this product became useless after 4 months . Its connecting pieces are made from plastic and broke after many uses . Idea is great , product needs more inventiveness .	-1
Rated this before . We bought a big and small one . Even the big one leaves barely enough room for the cat to do his business , and he sometimes ended up kicking turds out of the box or all over the wall because of the funny doorway.Does not work very easily and is a hassle . And it 's expensive . What a waste .	-1
for what it cost , I expected this to be a little sturdier . It 's nice and roomy but there 's nowhere to put any odor control on it . Frankly , I do n't use it the way it was intended to be used ... ... .seems to be way too much hassle them using a scoop . Also , harder to use a liner with it . The clips to attach the top/bottom together are flimsy and seem rather easy to break . I wonder how long they will last . Not at all what I expected . Fortunately , the old one is still in fairly good shape and I can keep as a back up .	-1
I did n't even dare put this together , seeing how thin the plastic is and how delicate its lock tabs . I have a kitty rescue ranch and hoped this would be of use . I would order several more but it is useless to me . Just my opinion . I sent it back . Happy it works for a few , from reviews I read . Plus , you roll it over to its side , all the way over , and the clumps spill into a drawer that you empty . Sounds good ? They leave out the fact it still leaves clumps stuck to the bottom that wo n't loosen w/o help . Therefore the cat has to use a dirty litter box unless it is emptied after every single use . I 've read reviews on this of people saying they do n't have to ( totally ) empty but once weekly . I feel sorry for any cat who must use dirty litter . It was mentioned also that you might duct tape it together when the tabs break . Would n't that cause a nasty build up along its edges ( inside the tape ) where it fits together ?	-1
This litter box sounds great in theory but it does not work good at all ! My cats like to get into the collection drawer . When you roll it , it gets litter everywhere . Save your time and money and buy a real automatic scooping litter box or just scoop it yourself . I ended up just using the bottom of it . I 'd use the top sometimes when we went out of town and needed a second litter box . My cats are outside cats now , so I only use it when we go out of town .	-1
Initially , I thought this was a good idea . The cat gets his privacy , and I have a way to make an unpleasant chore a little easier . But then I saw Galaxy Jackson on My Cat From Hell . A couple needed help with their cat not using the litter box . They had this litter box . Galaxy pointed out that a cat does n't want to be surrounded by his own urine and feces smell . That made perfect sense . I mean , when you think about it , you do n't scrub the litter box clean , so that means some remnants , even if it 's mainly smells , are left on the litter box after you clean it . When looked at it that way , it seems pretty gross .	-1
After an initial honeymoon period , when the litterbox was still new , therefor , relatively clean , and easy to keep clean , I was very happy with the purchase.THEN , after my cat had about of very loose stools , it became a nightmare to keep clean . The loose poop , which is covered by litter , gets caught in the straining grate . The entire box must be disassembled and cleaned out and it is very difficult to get the poop out from between the bars of the grate.Also , by chance , this weekend , I was watching a show on cats on Animal Planet . The cat expert talked about this exact box and said that it was bad for cats in the very way it is constructed . When you roll the box from side to side to redistribute the litter , the sides get coated with the scent of urine -- a complete turn off for cats ! ( I have noticed that no matter how clean I keep this box , both my cats have been opting for our more old fashioned ( and much easier to clean ) , though less private litter box.Sadly , this box was not a solution for us for easy litter box cleaning .	-1
When I was assembling the litter box , I noticed a splatter on the back wall and it smelled like litter had already been in it . The splatter was poop ! ! ! I looked closely and there were also scratch marks . Litter box came used !	-1
I really liked this litter box when I first bought it . I liked that it had a lid and was relatively easy to clean and use ; however , after less than a year of use , I 'm looking for something else . The litter started to leak out of various crevices each time I cleaned it . The plastic has warped over time leaving lots of gaps around the lid for litter to seep through . The internal grate that is supposed to filter the litter is too wide and dislodges easily from its tiny clips leaving much waste behind , which in turn leads to bad odors . I also do n't like that it does n't have a swinging door . One , the door would reduce some of the bad odors , second , the entrance is very low , so my cat spreads litter out of the box when she is digging to cover her business . Great idea , poor execution . On to the next option .	-1
Ugh ! This was not a good experience for me or my cat . My cat hated this litter box ( it was just too small for her ) and it was an absolute mess to clean . The internal sifter was just a huge pain in the butt to get clean and little bits of dried urine and poo would stick to the sifter . I was so disgusted with this box that I just threw it in the garbage . I was too upset to even return it . I just wanted it out of my house . I got a better one ( through Amazon , of course ! ) and my cat loves it . ( See my review of theX-Large Deluxe Hooded Litter Box ( Colors May Vary ) - now THAT 'S a great litter box . )	-1
This is not the miracle item they quite make it out to be . It has several design flaws which prevent it from meeting expectations:1 ) It 's too easy for cats to urinate on the 'screen ' which causes the screen to clog when trying to put it through the turning process.2 ) The section that holds the sifted cat litter is n't really big enough . I suppose it would be if you could pick up the unit and shake it to sift it through the screen but this is far too large and clunky to be able to do so.3 ) It says that it is ideal for big cats or multi-cat households but it definitely does not hold up with multiple cats . I suppose if you had the time to sit by it all day and go through the process every time one of them used it , maybe , but for those in the real world who work and have lives , not so much.I can think of a few ways to re-engineer this to do a much better job such as making the tray larger and put a sifting screen bottom on it and encouraging the litter to pass through it instead . But it would require basically starting from scratch on the design.That said , the reason I gave it 2 stars instead of 1 is because you can ultimately take the top off and use it like a regular litter box so it 's not completely useless .	-1
I really was hoping this would be good bc the other reviews were good . No way , this thing is a joke . Does n't work , make as mess everywhere . I just threw it away .	-1
Bought this due to raving reviews , however this item does not apply to people who live in apartments and small spaces . The item it self takes a lot of space , plus you need extra more space just to roll it over . One the cleaning side , some of the clumps get stuck on the grate so I still have to `` fish '' it out . Litter boxes would have to be thoroughly cleaned at least 1 month , this is much more work and an ordinary litter box.Im still using it since I do n't want to waste my money but I 'll go back to a regular litter box w/ manual scooping after 1 year . I have a 2nd litter box [ ... ] and will probably buy the same since this one works wonderfully , no corners to get the clumps stuck and soooooo easy to clean and maintain . 2 cats ( 1 15lbs and 1 20lbs ) 11-18-2010Arggggh as what previous reviews said , the clips are flimsy . I broke the front clip ! Less than a month ! I only turn it twice a day ( am & pm ) . Even if I could get a replacement , Im really tired of the extra clean up ... .. ( stuck stuff in grate )	-1
I was so hoping to like this litter box because of all its ' glowing reviews . We have 4 cats and 3 boxes which we scoop every single day . Honestly , the only positive comment I can make is the pleasant neutral colors of the box . The box is practically impossible to scoop out of . Why would I try to scoop a litter box that is `` self-cleaning '' you ask , because it DOES N'T work ! The lid attatchments are not user friendly to latch and unlatch . Make sure you get them on exactly correct before you try to roll the box over ! We use Tidy Cats scoopable litter and the mechanics of rolling the box on its ' lid made for a mess ( even when done slowly ) . Clumps stuck to the box or broke apart and crumbles were mixed in with what was left of the `` clean '' litter . Even with slowly turning the box over I felt like too much `` clean '' litter went into the catch drawer which is dumped . Our cats tend to like to scratch an almost clear area of the box to void and that does n't release from the box surface during roll-overs . The lack of swinging door and lack of charcoal filters made a marked increase in odor eminating from the box . We place 2 of our boxes in the laundry room and the third in a corner behind a recliner chair . The size of the box was very cumbersome to manipulate ( try to roll over , scoop , or get the lid off ) especially in the corner . The box takes up so much more room to try to do these things than our old boxes which the lids easily and fully detatch . The boxes are about the same size , it 's just that this self cleaning one takes up a lot of space when you are rolling it back and forth . There is no handle on the top of this box to help you grab it in order to move it to an area where you have the space to work it and access it . A large portion of the surface area ( floor ) of the litter box is taken up by the `` clean '' litter receptacle space , so despite the box 's size , it really does n't offer that much space for your cat to use it . Once you have finished `` cleaning '' the box then you have to tip it backward to get the litter out of the receptacle area . I found it difficult to get the litter evenly distributed on the floor of the box . You need to shake the box , roll it forward and backward and side to side . All in all I returned the box after trying it for about a week . It took a lot more effort to use than the old style we had , it made for more work , and made more of a mess ( and odor ) to manage . Our cats did use it , but did not seem to show a preference for it over the old style .	-1
When we got this , I was thrilled , thrilled ! It was so easy to use , so clean compared to other litter boxes . The box is now two weeks old and falling apart . When you clean it , it dumps litter all over the floor because all of the latches are failing . I would pay double or triple for a box like this that actually held up to use .	-1
Carefully read the directions twice and then attempted to put it together.Followed the directions and struggled to get all the clamps to lock . No matter what I do , the final clamp will not lock in place.So one star for great concept . Two bleeding thumbs down for ease of assembly .	-1
This product just teaches cats to avoid using the litter box . If you have this product and your cat has litter box issues , this is the root of the problem . The design of this litter box means rolling poop and pee onto the sides of the litter box and pretty much coating the inside like a cement mixer . Even with clumping litter , they break apart and they do n't always clump well , they will break apart especially when you are rolling it around . Why would your cat want to enter a tight dark space with pee and poo on the walls . It is far easier to just scoop the litter vs rolling the whole litter box . This litter box was also featured on the show `` My Cat from Hell '' Season 1 Ep . 3 `` Wild Cat '' . The second half of the episode demonstrated how much one couple 's cat hated this litter box .	-1
If you use this litter box the way it is advertised ( rolling it over , etc . ) it will accumulate poop and pee all over the roof and nasty stuff will get stuck in the & # 34 ; filter & # 34 ; portion . This causes the entire box to smell to high heaven . Cats refused to use it . Would poop in front of it in protest . Had to clean this baby out with bleach and hose in the driveway . Now they use it . However , I am not longer using the rolling technique and removed the filter and scoop insert . So it is just a normal litter box now . Sad face .	-1
First off this is a LARGE box , almost twice as big as the usual covered box . You need three or four feet to `` roll '' the box unless you want to do the partial-roll , slide-to-the-left , roll-some-more , repeat backwards to settle the litter . ( oh my back ! ) . The box is very flimsy so it flexes when you roll it . The latches are a total joke . After a weeks use of rolling , leaking , banging on the bottom a latch came loose and spilled the litter all over . My cat decided to go in only one place so after about two uses there was a football size litter ball stuck to the bottom , welded to the grate or firmly molded in one corner . If the ball did come loose the drawer could n't be opened with the ball in it . I finally discarded the grate and top so I have a very expensive pan litter box.Reality check : If you have a cat you 're going to scoop litter one way or the other .	-1
Nothing special ... Just using a regular mans comb works better ... .Also , my cat got dandruff from this ... . Harsh metal , kinda pointy.Completely not worth the money , do yourself a favor and buy a regular cheap plastic comb .	-1
This comb does not work on DSH cats . The teeth are too far apart to be effective our flea comb works better	-1
It is a standard slicker brush . Not & # 34 ; gentle & # 34 ; at all . Misleading advertising . I wish I could return it but I opened it before I discovered the problem .	-1
I read all the reviews on this item and it looked like a good deal . I have one long haired cat and bought him a long hair Furminator , but he is n't all that crazy about it . He tolerates it for about 5 minutes and he is gone . When I bring it out , he disappears.Since reviewers stated this was specifically for long haired cats , I decided to try it.When unpaced it , the little metal spines which are to pull hair out looked terribly sharp . They were sligtly curved , but they still looked and felt awfully sharp.Before I could , in good conscience , try this on my long haired grey , I gave it a tentative try on my own hair which is long . OUCH ! It went directly into my scalp and hurt.It did not pull any of my loose hairs out , but then I do not have an undercoat , so I finally screwed up my courage and very gently tried it on the cat.It pulled his regular hair and got a wee bit of undercoat off . I was a little more forceful . Some more undercoat came out , but the cat was not looking happy . At long last , I tried a regular `` pull '' through the hair . OUCH ! The cat was off and hidden . He tried to give the thing a good biting on his way off the bed where I was holding him , but he missed . No matter . He hid.My shourt haired cat is a lot tougher , so I gave it a try on her . With the furminator , she will sit for 20 minutes while I groom her . But with this , OUCH ! and she was gone . ( Now , I realize it is n't for short hairs , but just as a comparison , I tried it.Well , this was a waste for me and my cat family . It hurt the long haired cat who will tolerate the Furminator . It hurt my head.I think it is an accident waiting to happen : scratched cat skin . I do not recommend it.The long haired furminator must be out of stock as it is not coming up , but here is a product link to the one for short hairs.FURminator Short Hair deShedding Tool for Small Cats	-1
Just received this item , and like other customers feel that it is an extremely poorly constructed item , not nearly worth the price point at which we purchased it . When we received it , the item was EXTREMELY light , weighing just a couple of ounces . Its actually difficult to take the lid off without moving the box around , i imagine , even with items inside ( doggy toys not likely to weigh enough to stabilize this plastic shell on my wood floors ) , the box will be sliding around for the duration of ownership.However , the primary reason why I 'm giving it a 1 is because its extremely poor construction . The inside edge of the lid is jagged , not smooth , and very sharp . Moving it around could very well result in cuts from handling it . It 's very noticeable that the product was poorly built , almost as if the inner lid area was cut by hand with a saw or something , definitely not machine cut . The whole thing feels like a piece of cheap plastic and any item in the $ 25-30 range should have been built to more detailed specifications .	-1
Like anyone reading this we spoil our dogs rotten after all is there any other alternative ? In fact i do n't think a week has gone by that I can remember NOT buying dog toys for our Bulldogs who rip open anything the UPS m an dem or elivers regardless if it 's for them or not.This said , our house can often look like a dog toy factory after an industrial accident , they 're virtually everywhere . The floor , Beds , dressers , stairs etc etc ... .Yes we have adorabable wooden toy chests with adorable wooden lids and adorable pictures and cut outs . But our ever expanding inventory is no match for these adorably over priced chests . We need large capacity industrial sized containers for those quick clean ups when company stops by , well , there 's that and avoiding a law suit when someone unintentionally trips over a super sized Nylabone treat filled `` thing '' .So I ordered the Large , does it hold dog toys ? yes . But so does a card board box.To say it 's disapointing is an understatement . Terrible build quality and it 's VERY flimsy . The color ? a murky Grey . Afterall why make a BONE the color WHITE . Everyone want 's some horribly made piece of plastic that 's both the size of a Volkswagon and the color of a cadaver as the focal point of their living room.For us , we spent more time finding a place to put it that no one could possibly ever find even if we gave them a map then we did putting toys inside of it . If you 're looking for storage and you despise quality , decent design or even a hint of whimsy , elegance or style - then this Doggie Toy Box should delight you no end .	-1
I bought this as a gift for a good friend who has dogs . Within minutes , her dog had removed the hair from the tail and head , and he had started choking . She had to reach in and manually remove the `` feather '' from her dog 's throat . The dog still plays with it -- but not until AFTER she cut the remaining hair/feathers off the rooster . With that removed , the dog can safely play with his new toy , and he loves the sound the rooster makes.I would advise that anybody giving this to their beloved pet trim the head and tail hair real short before giving it to your dog .	-1
If you 've read the reviews , MamaBear007 wrote that she sent this to a friend . I 'm that friend . I have 6 Greyhounds so they are large dogs with more toys than I care to count or pick up each night.This rooster was one of 6 fabulous toys MamaBear007 sent as Valentine 's Day gifts for my pups . At first glance , this rooster was a hit : not only with the 6 dogs , but with me as well . It crows like a real rooster - and it crows pretty loudly . Gave me the giggles over and over as the dogs shared and played with it the last few days . However , my giggles and enjoyment turned to heart-pounding panic when my largest boy , about 88 lbs , began choking and panic-running around the house because he could n't breathe . Shoving a wooden spoon handle between his jaws to keep from having his jaws clamp down on me , I shoved my hand and fingers deep into his mouth to clear his airway . I pulled out 2 wet , thick wads of the roosters longer 'hair ' from either the tail or the head of the toy . One wad of this material was deep in the back of my boy 's throat and the other wad was stuck on the roof of his mouth . They resembled wet , matted mohair/wool ( or a hairball if you 're a cat person ) . But the 'hair ' is so soft that once it got wet in his mouth , it just stuck - there was no way for him to move or remove it and the more he tried , the more balled up it became and the more it made him try to swallow.He loved this toy so much ( it was his favorite of all 6 toys MamaBear007 sent them ) so I gave Mr. Rooster a haircut . Took my sewing scissors and cut the long wooly hair from his head , around his face and his rump/tail . Mr. Rooster did n't look too bad after that and I figured he was now safe for my babies . He was n't . This morning , while I sat here checking the GB deals , my boy found Mr. Rooster in the toy box and once , again , while I was n't looking , began choking . Even after cutting the hair short enough to knick the stitching and make a few small holes in the toy itself , he still managed to lick enough fuzz off this thing to wad up in the back of his throat . Now , I cut this short as you can see from the photos I 've included . You can see some of the original 'wet ' tail fuzz from when they first got the toys , and then the haircut . It seems that even cut short , if you gently pull on the little short fuzz , long , thread-like pieces of wooly material comes off this toy . It reminds me of someone spinning wool the way it just keeps coming and coming as you pull it.So , unless you 're going to sit right there and watch your pet play with this and not turn your back , I would recommend you skip this one until the manufacturer changes the material on head and tail . Sadly , as much fun as this is for them and me , it is now in the trash .	-1
the locks are pitiful ! the whole thing falls apart in 4 - 5 days , the middle pan is a really mess to clean .	-1
Agree 100 % with Allie - this sounds better then it is practical . The concept DOES NOR WORK IN REAL LIFE . I did try few different litters - all the same problem - there are peaces always stuck in the mesh of the `` cleaning '' part pan and to get them out is a messy challenge.I have 2 other boxes and prefer use the old system - scooper daily . `` I loved the concept of this but it is messy . I got litter all over the floor when I was tipping it into the garbage sack , bits stick in the mesh and some fall out unexpectedly , and then you have to pour the remaining ( dirty ) litter into the other pan to get it on top of the mesh again - which releases dust , smells disgusting and just is n't a clever thing to do .	-1
I thought I would like the convenience of this product with the strainer pan , and 2 other pans included . However , I found the whole process just too cumbersome . I do like having a 2nd pan to rotate out and clean while the other is in use , but I am using my old large and solid scooper to remove the soiled litter . I am going to have to get a larger box though because the rescue boy kitty I got back in June is now huge and long . This box is only an average size .	-1
